Hydrogen can fill perhaps 1% of the world's energy needs, but will be extremely costly if we try for much more than 1%.

Another is a giant green house with a mile high chimney which turns wind turbines.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927910_0002.4
I think it produces less energy than the mirrors unless the chimney is extremely tall.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927910_0004.6
Re Photo Voltaics.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927910_0004.7
I think that your economics are a little off but if I paid $150.00 for a panel that made a dimes worth of electricity per day it would have a payback time of approximately 41 years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927910_0004.9
Next year the panel will cost $120.00 and the electricity will be worth $0.12.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927910_0004.12
It happens even faster if you use the panels for a roof on your house.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927910_0004.13
Deduct the cost of the roof from the cost of the panels and your payback comes down to 10 years or so.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927910_0004.14
Thats on a par with fossil fuels now and probably has something to do with the proliferation of sellers of Photo Voltaic panels today.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927910_0007.7
When your batteries get old they give back less than 1/2 the charging power so that is also a sizable cost whether you replace the batteries or use them another year or two.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927910_0007.8
The batteries need a shelter outside the house due to possible fumes and possible explosion.

As far as roofing with solar panels is concerned I see no reason why panels and roofs designed for the job could not be made superior to shingles which IMO are vastly inferior and only modestly less expensive than (my personal favorite) standing seam "galvanized" or "powder coated" metals.

The 99-ton cache of AK47s was to have been secretly flown to Iraq in 2004 from a U.S. base in Bosnia, but there is no proof that the four plane loads of arms ever arrived, said Amnesty International in a report released last week.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0305.6
According to the report titled "Dead on Time," private arms brokers working for the Pentagon clandestinely shipped hundreds of thousands of weapons and tens of millions of rounds of ammunition from Bosnia to Iraq between July 2004 and June 2005.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0305.7
During those shipments, at least 200,000 Kalashnikovs went missing after passing through the hands of private contractors from a half dozen countries.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.1
There is nothing about making weapons illegal for civilians in this treaty because that is not the point of this one.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.2
This one is just designed to make it easier to track down people's weapons.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.3
Only after they get enough tools in place to track down all the guns will they start pushing treaties that make guns illegal for civilians.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.4
oh?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.5
Point to the part of the treaty that makes it easier to track down who owns guns?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.6
Articles 7 and 8 (which replicate the decentralized gun registration system that was set up here in 1968).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.7
So you don't want to enforce US laws then?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.8
The treaty doesn't create anything not already in existence in US law.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.9
Laws concerning the ILLEGAL transfer of weapons hardly make it easier to track down weapons owned legally.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.10
Yes they do.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.11
Since the laws already exist in the US and have since 1968, your fear of losing your weapon has obviously been realized, right?.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.12
Your fears have proven correct, haven't they?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.13
When did you lose your guns?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.14
Or is 38 years not long enough to get over your paranoia?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.15

Don't be a bigot.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.17
So, when did you lose your guns?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.18
There is nothing in the treaty that is not already US law.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.19
Yet you haven't lost your guns under US law.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.20
When the treaty to take your guns away comes along then you can complain about treaties wanting to take your guns away.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0306.21
Until then you are acting paranoid and demanding we ignore US laws.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.1
It seems you didn't bother to read the statement by Bolton oralloy
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.2
The United States goes to great lengths to ensure that small arms and light weapons transferred under our jurisdiction are done so with the utmost responsibility.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.3
The transfer of all military articles of U.S. origin are subject to extremely rigorous procedures under the U.S. Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.4
All U.S. exports of defense articles and services, including small arms and light weapons, must be approved by the Department of State.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.5
Assurances must be given by the importing country that arms will be used in a manner consistent with our criteria for arms exports: they must not contribute to regional instability, arms races, terrorism, proliferation, or violations of human rights.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.6
Arms of U.S. origin cannot be retransferred without approval by the United States.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.7
To ensure that arms are delivered to legitimate end-users, our government rigorously monitors arms transfers, investigating suspicious activity and acting quickly to curtail exports to those recipients who do not meet our strict criteria for responsible use.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.8
In the past five years, the United States has conducted thousands of end-use checks, interdicted thousands of illicit arms shipments at U.S. ports of exit, and cut-off exports entirely to five countries due to their failure to properly manage U.S. origin defense articles.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.9
All commercial exporters of arms in the United States must be registered as brokers and submit each transaction for government licensing approval.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.10
Our brokering law is comprehensive, extending over citizens and foreign nationals in the United States, and also U.S. citizens operating abroad.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.11
Believing that it is in our interest to stem the illicit trade in military arms, the United States has avidly promoted and supported such international activities as the Wassenaar Arrangement and the UN Register of Conventional Arms.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.12
Bilaterally, we offer our financial and technical assistance all over the world to mitigate the illicit trade in SA/LW. We have worked with countries to develop national legislation to regulate exports and imports of arms, and to better enforce their laws.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.13
We have provided training, technical assistance, and funds to improve border security and curb arms smuggling in many areas of the world where this problem is rampant.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.14
And in the past year, we have instituted a program to assist countries in conflict-prone regions to secure or destroy excess and illicit stocks of small arms and light weapons.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0330.15
It seems Bolton (and the US) is against "illicit" trade just like the UN treaty is.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0331.1

I'll say it once again: We need to have the military conduct airstrikes on these NGOs.

A single napalm raid on IANSA headquarters could save us a lot of grief in the long run.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0334.1
It has been pointed out that the proposed treaty deals only with the illegal manufacture and distribution of firearms--in which case, your objections don't seem to actually refer to the text of the proposed treaty.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0334.2
As they build stronger and stronger measures to track down "illegal weapons" they'll move into making treaties that start declaring more weapons illegal.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0334.3
It has also been pointed out (in particular, by me), that the consent of two thirds of the Senate would be required to secure ratification of such a treaty.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0334.4
Do you apprehend that this would occur?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0334.5
The NRA does not have as strong a hold on the Senate as they do on the House.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0334.6
However, the requirement for 2/3rds of the votes is comforting.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0334.7
I'd guess that the NRA could block most of it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0334.8
But my preference would be to not risk such a vote in the first place.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0334.9
Also, the NRA has a poor track record in standing up for full-auto weapons, so their defense there might not be as solid as for other weapons.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.1
The argument of the fanatics of the gun lobby is, whether overtly made, or inferentially, that they need weapons to protect themselves from the tyranny of the government, and that this was the intent of the second amendment.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.2
Well, the primary motivation of the Framers was based on the premise that with a strong militia there would be no need for a standing army.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.3
They had the notion that a militia could never be tyrannical, and a standing army would probably lead to tyranny.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.4
However, there was a bit of a notion of the militia providing a last ditch defense against tyranny if it came to that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.5
In 1939, an appeal was made to the Supreme court by a representative of the Justice Department after an idictment was quashed against two men for transporting a sawed-off shotgun.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.6
In The United States versus Miller, the Court held:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.7
In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.8
Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.

A good ruling.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.12
I wish they'd start enforcing it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.14
The Supreme Court has never comprehensively reviewed the application of the IInd amendment.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.15
What about the above Miller Ruling?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.16
Further, in The United States versus Miller, the Court suggested that there might be a standard for determining what constitute the arms of the militia, although they did not delve further into what that might be.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.17
I think they did far more than suggest it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.18
So far, case law with the Supremes holds that states may regulate the militia and their arms, and prohibit armed bodies outside their regulatory code.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.19
Actually, I think it would be up to Congress to decide the arms, although the courts should be able to step in if Congress chose something inappropriate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.20
Quite apart from the appalling poor performance of militia in the history of the United States, there is no good reason to believe that any state ever has or ever will allow citizens to arm themselves as they choose and associate in armed bodies at their own discretion.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.21
However, hopefully we will someday return to the Constitution and have the states actually set up militia under government control, which people could join if they wished to.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.22
Whatever may please Oralloy has no bearing upon what regulation the states may enact, and whether or not the Supreme Court will permit such regulation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.23
Well on the Supreme Court thing, my statements are in line with the Constitution, and the Supreme Court has a fairly good track record of eventually returning to the Constitution when they have departed from it, so there may come a day when they will rule that way.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.24
And until then we have the NRA to fight gun legislation in Congress.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.25
It's a dream, and a sick and dangerous dream at that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0347.26
I don't see what is sick or dangerous about dreaming of having the Constitution followed.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0348.1
If the Supreme court decided a law was constitutional then how can it be unconstitutional?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0348.2
By violating the Constitution.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0348.3
The Supreme Court does not get to rewrite the Constitution.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0348.4
If they make an illegitimate ruling in support of an unconstitutional law, the government will have free rein to violate the Constitution until such time as the Supreme Court reverses their ruling, but it does not change the fact that the Constitution is being violated throughout this time.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0348.5
"Separate but equal" is a good example of this.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0348.6
The Supreme Court issued bogus rulings that allowed the government to do unconstitutional segregation for many years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0348.7
The fact that the Supreme Court allowed it does not change the fact that it was a blatant violation of our Constitution.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0349.1
So, you don't support enforcing the laws then oralloy.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0349.2
You only support enforcing those you don't disagree with, those laws you don't think violate the constitution.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0349.3
The legal rulings don't matter.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0349.4
Only your personal opinion does.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0349.5
A fool's game that allows you to pretend to want to follow the law at the same time you are more than willing to ignore it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0350.6
I'd hardly characterize "support for our Constitution" as a fool's game....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6837912_0351.1
The fool's game is deciding solely on your own about what is constitutional without reference to the constitutional manner in how constitutionality is decided.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0126.1
Simply meant that execution is, in itself, barbarism.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0126.2
Three reasons I can see to use it:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0126.3
1) Retribution
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0126.4
Which, while I understand the motivation, is not a power I want granted to the state, especially not to the point of taking a life.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0126.5
2) Deterrence
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0126.6
I'm not the least bit convinced that execution is any more of a deterrent than life in prison.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0126.7
China executes around a thousand people a year, and yet they still find more people committing these same crimes.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0126.8
What gives?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0126.9
3) Economics.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0126.10
The argument that execution is cheaper than incarceration is bogus unless we eliminate the right to appeal, in which case we subvert our entire legal system.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0126.11
And if capital punishment is inherently barbarous (which, as far as I'm concerned, it is), then affordability as a determinant is doubly so.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0127.1
patiodog,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0127.2
I agree without reservation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0127.3
I too find capital punishment barbaric and vengeful.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0127.4
I am of the opinion that vengance should never be a part of a justice system.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0127.5
But there are those who disagree with me, and to say that they must support barbarism not because capital punishment is barbarism but because they support deterrence and deterrence in the extreme must be condoned in any form or by a hypocrite is a horse of a different color.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0127.6
Joe was not arguing that they need to stop supporting capital punishment to avoid being a foolish hypocrite.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0127.7
He was saying they need to support the most barbaric method of execution possible.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0127.8
To support this he contends that more barbarism is more of a deterrent so all who wish to deter must deter in said extreme manner.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0127.9
Calling capital punishment hypocritical is an argument behind which I stand.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0127.10
Calling someone a hypocrite for not being on the very extreme of their side of the aisle is what I disagree with.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0128.1
I disagree with the notions some have asserted that capital punishment is inherently barbaric.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0128.2
In fact, I think a reasonable case could be argued that it is the more humane punishment of the two options being advocated here.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0128.3
I am not at all convinced that putting a person into prison with no chance of parole is less barbaric than putting that person out of his/her misery via execution.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0128.4
And I do not see how advocating less violent -- less painful methods of execution -- can be seen as hypocritical.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0128.5
The issue society is dealing with here reduces to keeping the offending people from doing whatever it is they did to warrant capital punishment.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0128.6

bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0172.18
Jacobs' co-defendant was also convicted, though he was not sentenced to death.

* Texasexecuted Robert Nelson Drew on August 2, 1994 after refusing to give him a new hearing after another man signed an affidavit in which he confessed to the murder, thereby exonerating Drew.

* Texasexecuted Leonel Herrera in 1993 despite compelling evidence of his innocence.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0172.21
A former Texas judge submitted an affidavit stating that another man had confessed to the crime for which Herrera was facing execution.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0172.22
Numerous other pieces of new evidence also threw doubt on his conviction.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0172.23
According to the Supreme Court, however, that proof was not sufficient to stop his execution because of the late stage of his appeal.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0172.24
* Virginiaexecuted Roger Keith Coleman in 1992.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0172.25
Coleman's appellate attorneys misread the statute governing the time frame for submitting an appeal and filed their brief one day too late.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0172.26
The Virginia state courts held that the one-day-late filing was the equivalent of no filing at all and refused to review his issues.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0172.27
The federal courts subsequently held that Coleman could not raise a federal claim because he had waived his state review.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0172.28
Finally, the Supreme Court determined that Coleman could not complain that it was his attorneys who erred because he was not entitled to an attorney in the first place.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0172.29
No court ever fully reviewed the evidence of his innocence prior to his execution.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0173.1
Scrat
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0173.2
Moot - Do they have the death penalty in your state?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0173.3
Yes they do.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0173.4
But to my knowledge they haven't used it, at least since I have lived here.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0173.5
California acquired the death penalty shortly after the Manson murders because people here were so appalled and outraged at the atrocities these monsters did that nothing short of death seemed appropriate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0173.6
But the death penalty bill was passed after the fact and so Manson and his gang will have the luxury of living in prison till they die.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0173.7
I could be wrong but I think California may have more prisons than any other state.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0173.8
We have a 'three strikes and you're out' law.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0173.9
The prisons are filling up and they're building more.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0173.10
I think the 3 strikes law has worked in that 2 strikers have left the state, so if they got caught again they wouldn't spend life in prison.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0173.11
Some deterent.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0173.12
It just caused California criminals to go to other states less stringent.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0173.13
I think Nevadas crime rate went up as a result.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0173.14
I don't care for 3-strikes laws, as they strip a judge of his or her discretionary powers in these 3rd strike cases.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.1
Hmmm - I know it is a deviation from a thread about execution - but I am nonetheless stunned by what seems to be a casual assumption that the penalty ought to be a choice between execution and prison for life.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.2
This must be purely based on revenge, no?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.3
I do not know as much about murderers in the USA, where murder is far more common than it is here, but I do know that here, in Australia, most murderers are out in about 10 - 12 years (I might be somewhat out of date here) - it used to be closer to 8.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.4
Why?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.5
Well, at least here, the "ordinary" murderer is the least likely to re-offend of criminals.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.6
Clearly, professional gang-land killers, or serial or "lust" killers are different - the average fella who kills once - without a violent history - is likely to be more like you and me than the average crim.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.7
Women who kill are - at least here - most likely to do so after years of violence - and a number of attempts to escape said violence - not infrequently when they find the fella has abused the kids.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.8
Not all - some of them are terrifying - and I wouldna wanna meet them in a dark alley - but the majority - so far.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.9
Or, they (male and female) are nuts.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.10
And, proving insanity is way harder here than in the USA.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.11
(Mind you, more women are getting more violent - as are the men - I could comment at great length on that, but it is prolly irrelevant.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.12
So - if they are at little risk of re-offending - what do we do?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.13
(And it generally ain't that hard to tell the ones who are - PROVING it is harder...)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.14
Prison isn't generally gonna make someone better.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.15
Very much the opposite.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.16
Deterrence?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.17
Hmmmmmmm - my reading suggests that, with such crimes, it MAY deter if apprehension is almost certain almost all the time.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.18
Hmmmmmm...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.19
So - revenge.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.20
Fabulous.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.21
Is no consideration to be given to the crim?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.22
Just how good a basis is revenge for sentencing?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.23
As PART of the process, fine.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.24
As all of it?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.25
Crap.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.26
How many of you talking so easily of execution or life without parole know anything about the people who commit these crimes?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.27
About what execution or life in prison entails?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6838750_0177.28
Really?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0212.1
Aha, Fox, you were read the same book I have --
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0212.2
Lions and Tigers and Bears, oh my!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0213.1
You two (Fox and Piff) must have a different version in mind of LBS than I do.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0213.2
I didn't read any LBS books, but I saw many movie shorts depicting a "stereotypical" white-wide-lipped, wide-eyed Sambo,who seemed concocted for the purpose of denigrating black people.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0213.3
Should have known Fox wouldn't have yearned for the return of that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0213.4
I must hold a symposium on the difference between PC, unPC and racism....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0213.5
When we're all up to it--I'd be interested to see how people categorize these things.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0248.1
"Maybe it's a cultural difference but I do not see that "encouraging racism" extrapolates into "being racist"" Said Fox.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0248.2
Lol!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0248.3
You're right.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0248.4
Apparently, - according to Lash, it extrapolates into being worse than racist:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0248.5
"I think making excuses for racism is a dangerous form of racism.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0248.6
Possibly more dangerous than the lunkheads that come out and say the crap."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0248.7
Let's not COMPLETELY re-write the facts about what Lash said, Fox.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0248.8
She can say what she likes, within the TOS, but I and Nimh may, I think, reserve the right to be pretty disgusted by such comments.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0249.1
I accept that this is the way you saw it Dlowan.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0249.2
I do not accept that as the way Lash meant it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0249.3
Do you disagree that making excuses for racism is as bad or worse than racism itself?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0249.4
I don't believe she was personally directing that at you or Nimh.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0249.5
I think she was passionately expressing a conviction.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0249.6
I think we should all be allowed to do that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0250.1
Fox - I am flying out of here in an hour or so.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0250.2
And, frankly, I don't care what Lash thinks.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0250.3
I won't be staying and arguing anything, your words just caught my attention.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0250.4
I think there is nothing to be added to Nimh's and my arguments about the meagre "matter" of this thread - made many pages ago.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0250.5
I think Nimh has also made the definitive comments about Lash's insults.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0250.6
As far as I am concerned, there is nothing left to say here - and that is what I will be saying.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0250.7
I enjoy arguing, and sometimes pretty harshly, cos I am passionate, too, but there are places I think it silly to go.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0250.8
You are also begging the actual question of whether Nimh and I WERE encouraging racism, you see.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0250.9
Did you realise that?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0250.10
You, having skipped the meat of the matter, now go on to ask the equivalent of the "have you stopped beating your wife" question.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0250.11
I have not actually argued, here, that Lash ought not to be allowed to do what she did.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0250.12
I consider that kind of arguing distasteful, and I DO think it was clearly a personal attack - but such is life.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0251.1
Okay Dlowan.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0251.2
You know I love you and Nimh and appreciate you both.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0251.3
I think all of us, even me though I'm damn near perfect of course, are capable of phrasing things that have a completely unintentional affect on others.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0251.4
Probably that's even why I piss so many people off here.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0251.5
I really don't mean to.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0251.6
I want to be loved as much as the next person.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0251.7
And I'll no doubt keep right on doing it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.1
A few thoughts in perusing the fallout here:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.2
1) Fox-- I feel sort of responsible for you feeling as though you had to defend my statements-- of course, I didn't expect it, but I did value it greatly.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.3
2) When I said this-- "I think making excuses for racism is a dangerous form of racism.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.4
Possibly more dangerous than the lunkheads that come out and say the crap"-- I meant it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.5
The same has been said of those who quietly listen to anti-Jew rhetoric or jokes, and remain silent, or laugh in tacit agreement.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.6
It applies to all people and all minority groups, who are maligned.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.7
Previously, most people here have agreed.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.8
Suddenly, at least one poster not only signals strong disagreement, but they they tacitly admit this comment applies to them.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.9
(Or seem to by not just saying it doesn't.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.11
Why didn't dlowan simply say she doesn't make excuses for it?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.12
I wondered why she didn't just do that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.13
3) When I said this-- "Do I think either of them go about harboring ill thoughts and feelings of superiority toward other people due to skin color and such?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.14
No.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.15
Do I think they embolden and service racism by keeping silent in the face of this crap?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.16
I certainly do"-- I had in mind dlowan's comment that the cartoons, racist and otherwise, were funny.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.17
I had in mind nimh's post which ignored the racial attacks against Rice, and wrote a tit-for-tat response about Jesse Jackson--which I took to mean that if Republicans didn't like Jackson--we should accept that the attack on Rice was the GOP's just desserts.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.18
I was really surprised by this.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.19
I tried to show the difference in not liking Jackson, and an all out attack on Rice per her race, by saying "You would have a point if Jesse Jackson was ever portrayed as Little Black Sambo"--which was ignored.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.20
4) I took care to say this-- "What we established is I didn't say they were racists"-- more than once.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.21
It was quite a tightrope walk--because I feel that in almost all circumstances, you cannot know the mind of the one making statements.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.22
So, my statements were as general as I could muster, in hopes of eliciting a clarification.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.23
5) That dlowan sees this as a personal attack is stretching far too thin-- "I think making excuses for racism is a dangerous form of racism.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.25
It is clearly a very general statement.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.26
One with which I'd think she'd agree.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.27
6) It seems to me all this sidebar indignation is a dodge of the central issue.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.28
Why would anyone feel indignation to comments that don't apply to them?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.29
Why would nimh continue with the focus on my statements, when he obviously agreed once he saw the pictures a la PDiddie?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.30
Since the comment about tacit approval of racism was made, nimh has come in with several long, play by play analysis of the discussion.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.31
He acts as though I had no right to make such statements because of the exact location of the first mention of the Aunt Jemima pictures.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.32
By the time he'd seen them, he agreed with me that they were across the line.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.33
If he had done that earlier, his name would not have appeared in what we may now describe as the Apocalyptic Hey You Guys Are Surprisingly On The Wrong Side Of This Issue post.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.34
But, he was late in seeing them, and had already been fingered as a possible suspect--and begun his indignant responses.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.35
Timing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.36
It really is everything.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0252.37
Thanks again, Fox.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0253.1
Yes- this is what happens when you don't read responses.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0253.2
Try again, Lash.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0253.3
You MIGHT see what I meant when I said ONE cartoon was funny.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0253.4
I would happily have explained what I was ACTUALLY saying, but you never asked - you simply launched into accusations.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0253.5
Thing is, once that happens, all reason is gone.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0253.6
NIMH has the patience and passion to explain, I sometimes do not.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0253.7
Fox - lol!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0253.8
We fight all the time - but seldom really fuss.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0253.9
Now - if I could just straighten out your politics!!!!!Lol!!!!!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0254.1
I have to agree with Lash that sometimes, given time differences, dial-up versus high speed, sometimes hot topics on A2K become quite bizzare to read.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0254.2
Now, I've actually read the responses, and also agree with dlowan.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0254.3
I say, let's just spread the love.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0254.5
That's politics.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0254.6
I'm sure the cartoonists think they are all terribly ironic, and forget that some of them are not all that talented.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0254.7
As per the issue of Republicans appointing minorities to important positions, and the suggestion that this is something the Democrats never did, I couldn't care less.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0254.8
It's still politics, not honesty about how people actually feel about each other.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.1
AC's not angry.

In light of their reaction to the nomination of Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state, I gather liberals have gotten over their enthusiasm for multiculturalist milestones.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.6
It's interesting that they dropped their celebrations of the "first woman!"
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.7
"first black!"

"first Asian!"

designations at the precise moment that we are about to get our first black female secretary of state.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.10
When Madeline Albright was appointed the FIRST WOMAN secretary of state, the media was euphoric.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.11
(And if memory serves, Monica Lewinsky was the first Jewish female to occupy her various positions on the president's, uh, staff.)

With Albright at the helm of the State Department, Osama bin Laden ran wild throughout the Middle East, the North Koreans began feverishly building nukes under her nose, and we staged a pre-emptive attack solely for purposes of regime change based on false information presented to the American people by Albright about a world leader who was not an imminent threat to the United States.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.13
Slobodan Milosevic wasn't even a latent, long-term, hypothetical threat.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.14
But the girls in the mainstream media were too smitten with Albright's brooch collection and high heels to notice the shambles she was making of foreign policy.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.15
The New York Times raved about Albright's brooches in an article titled, "A Diplomat Who Says 'Read My Pins.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.16
'" In the San Francisco Chronicle, Leah Garchik was amazed by Albright's "jewel-encrusted flag" pin - Albright's clever ruse to prove that Republicans did not have "dibs on patriotic jewelry."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.17
Perhaps Rice could impress American journalists if she talked more about her accessorizing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.18
People magazine quoted an aide gushing that Albright "stays in her heels all day."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.19
Albright herself told Harper's Bazaar, "I've kidded that the advantage of being a woman secretary of state is makeup."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.20
This was a great leap forward for feminism?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.21
At this point even Paris Hilton was rolling her eyes and saying, "Oh, come on now!"
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.22
But Bush nominates a brilliant geopolitical thinker who happens to be black and female and all of a sudden she's Butterfly McQueen, who don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' no Middle Eastern democracies.

Earlier this year, the flamboyant Richard Clarke claimed that when he briefed Rice in early 2001 about al-Qaida, her "facial expression gave me the impression that she had never heard the term before."

It's good to know that Clinton's chief terrorism "expert" believes himself to possess paranormal abilities such as ESP.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.25
Why couldn't Dick Clarke have used some of those mind-reading skills on Osama before al-Qaida blew up the USS Cole in October 2000?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.26
Or after?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.27
To the bitter end, the official position of the Clinton administration was that it couldn't say for sure who was responsible for the Cole attack.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.29
That was raw competence.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.30
I take that back: Albright also taught at Georgetown University.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.31
Of course, American universities make professors of people like Eldridge Cleaver's wife.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.32
(Kathleen Cleaver is currently at Yale law school; Susan Rosenberg, a participant in a Brinks car robbery, teaches at Hamilton College; former Weatherman Bill Ayers is a distinguished professor of education at the University of Illinois-Chicago; and former Weatherman Bernardine Dohrn is the director of a legal clinic at Northwestern University.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.33
Or how about Clinton's first secretary of state, Warren Christopher, a lawyer whose dazzling foreign policy experience consisted of being President Carter's chief negotiator for the hostages in Iran?

That's almost as impressive a resume entry as "Chief Iceberg Lookout, the Titanic," "Senior Design Engineer, the Edsel," "Navigator, Exxon Valdez," or "Writer/Executive Producer, 'Alexander.

The closest black woman to Bill Clinton was his secretary, Betty Currie - whose principal function was penciling in "Monica" on Clinton's "To Do" list every morning.

The closest black woman to most of the liberals accusing Rice of being incompetent is the maid they periodically accuse of stealing from the liquor cabinet.

George Bush chose a black woman to be his top adviser on national security.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.39
Now he wants her as his secretary of state.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.40
And when she becomes the first black female secretary of state, Rice will replace the first black secretary of state - both appointed by right-wing Republican George Bush.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.41
The entire Bush Cabinet is starting to look like an Image Awards telecast minus the fisticuffs and gunplay.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.42
Democrats are terrified that black people might start to notice.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.43
Say, there's a black woman standing next to President Bush...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.44
who is that?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.45
Never mind!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.46
It's probably somebody he's arresting!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.47
It's extremely valuable for Democrats to be able to campaign in black neighborhoods while talking about the "white boys" running the Republican Party.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.48
When she was managing Al Gore's 2000 campaign, Donna Brazile said she was not going to "let the white boys win in this election."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.49
(If I had a nickel for every time I've confused Al Gore, Joe Lieberman, Terry McAuliffe, Paul Begala and James Carville for the Jackson Five...)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.50
Sure enough, Brazile was instrumental in not letting a couple of white boys - named Al and Joe - win the election.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0296.51
I guess that's liberals' idea of a "competent" black woman.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0297.1
This is starting to sound like a mantra.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0297.2
So it's not just me then?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0297.3
No, it's not just you.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6843808_0297.4
Apparently you all get your information and opinions from the same place.

Sig Heil!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0026.1
In the Fox debate last week one of the candidates made the claim that Clinton gutted the military.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0026.2
This is all well and good except for the fact that 6 of Bill Clinton's 8 budgets were passed by Republican majorities in both houses of Congress.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0026.3
So if the military was gutted in the 1990s it was Republicans, like McCain and Thompson and Paul, that gutted it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0026.4
Huckabee is the only candidate in the Fox debate whom I remember expressly calling for increasing the size of the military.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0026.5
I would rather risk an unknown than knowns whose records are dismal.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0026.6
And as a matter of fact....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0026.7
Bush Sr. gutted the Army, not Clinton.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0026.8
How so?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0026.9
Just what did George H. W. Bush do the army?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0027.1
Huckabee may be able to attract evangelical Republicans, but he won't attract less tax, small government Repubs,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0027.2
Is this constituency large enough to put someone in the White House?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0027.3
Are there at least 50,000,000 voters who want their taxes lowered?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0027.4
BTW: Is it true that Huckabee raised taxes in Arkansas because the courts said he had to spend more money on public schools and that by raising such taxes and spending such money Arkansas' public schools are ranked #8 in the nation?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0027.5
and he won't attract Repub foreign policy hawks.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0027.11
More importantly, he won't attrack big contributions.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0027.12
Populists don't usually get the support of the Big Money, unless it Unions, and that money goes to Dems - no question.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0027.13
If Huckabee has a message or campaign style that can attract 30-40% of the GOP primary electorate what need will he have for large contributions?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0027.14
Personally I wouldn't want a candidate that thinks he has to have large contributions because by accepting them the candidate subjects himself to large obligations- which are likely detrimental to my personal welfare.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0027.15
Huckabee is not attracting the support of either fiscal conservatives or foreign policy hawks.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0027.16
The social conservatives who he does attract do not represent a large enough bloc to carry him through, even assuming he can capture them all.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0027.17
All candidates need big money supporters.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0027.18
It's nice to imagine that the grass roots could fund a candidate with contributions of $5 and $10 but this isn't going to happen in this race and especially not so if Huckabee can't attract more than 50% of the rank and file.

It was Giuliani who mentioned this is in the debate.

Giuliani falsely blamed President Clinton for cuts in the military that occurred in large part under President George H.W. Bush and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0028.14
He said that "the Army had been at 725,000; it's down to 500,000."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0028.15
That's true, but it was down to 572,423 by the time Clinton took office.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0028.17
Actually, most of the cutting to which Giuliani refers occurred during the administration of George H.W. Bush.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0028.19
In fact, to get to that number, one has to go back to 1990, during the first gulf war.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0028.20
Moreover, Clinton's cuts in the military, while large, were nowhere close to 25 percent to 30 percent.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0028.21
Between 1993 and 2001, the Army went from 572,423 to 480,801, which is a decline of 16 percent.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0028.22
The entire military went from 1,705,103 to 1,385,116, a decrease of 18.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0028.23
8 percent.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0028.24
Compare that with the far larger cuts made during the first Bush administration: In 1989, the military stood at 2,130,229 and the Army had 769,741 soldiers.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0028.25
By 1993, those numbers had declined by 19.9 percent and 25.6 percent, respectively.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0028.26
And as we've pointed out before, it was the first Bush administration - specifically then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney - that began bragging openly of the peace dividend.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0104.2

Now, I wonder what makes you think that I have a job guaranteed for life?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845231_0104.7

If the Fed wants an excuse to cut, the 3 month rate in CPI excluding food and energy paves the way.

Jim · I realize that it is the natural progression of the economy that raises the inflation rate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845999_0014.2
What frosts my behind is the fact that since Reagan the government has changed the way the inflation rate is figured by takeing out things like food, fuel and other everyday things that everyone has to buy.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6845999_0014.3
They seem to think we are too stupid to see that the stated inflation rate isn't related to the real cost of living.

Comment on Aaffirmative Action · Thank you for posting this question and the Dworkin article.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0002.2
I am no legal expert, but he certainly seems to have touched on at least many of the important points and ideas.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0002.3
For openers, I found the following passage to be very interesting.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0002.4
First, I'd like to say that I have always favored affirmative action in principle.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0002.5
That does not mean that I've favored everything that has ever been done or recommended in the name of affirmative action.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0002.6
In my early days of affirmative action awareness I may have thought of it as compensation for past wrongs.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0002.7
That idea evolved in my mind into the idea that affirmative action was a way of helping groups that had been discriminated against or otherwise disadvantaged by the society to overcome the resulting disadvantages.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0002.8
What I like in the above quotation is the emerging recognition that affirmative action is necessary in order to ensure a favorable future for the entire community.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0002.9
And that this goal is, first, admitted in the Bush push for the Texas plan; and second, that the goal of a good future via affirmative action is sought after by both major US corporations and the armed forces.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0002.10
I think this new focus takes us out of the past and away from ideas of compensation, and places us in the present with a healthy view toward the future.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0003.1
blatham - Just to clarify.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0003.2
You said "I would like to engage a debate on the affirmative action question which is presently before the US Supreme Court."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0003.3
Are you looking for a debate in the legal points (i.e. the legal aspects of how the court should or shouldn't rule..)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0003.4
or the social issue (and any court decision's impact either way..)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0003.5
overall?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0003.6
I think the points of law are pretty narrow in this case in the end.

To me, it makes the argument why AA was necessary, but many who believed it was vital, now believe it has gone far in accomplishing it's mission and the time has come to adjust to the more even playing field.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0021.5
How long do you think AA should stay in place?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0022.1
sofia - what i have seen as i travel and work in Michigan in particular leads me to believe that Affirmative Action is barely acknowledged.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0022.2
The playing field does not appear to be anywhere near level.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0022.3
As the author of the article Snood posted indicated, the playing field is still overly white-friendly.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0024.2
But in coming back and reviewing posts, I find myself once again in complete agreement with Dys and with Snood's quote.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0024.3
What I thought I had written was:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0024.4
Affirmative action is the result of a wholly unequal (and, god knows, underfunded, unimaginative, and underchallenging) educational system K-12.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0024.5
In that sense, affirmative action has got to go, but not before the fish take a look at the water they're swimming in and do something about a mostly white, middle-class culture which a) positively encourages the devaluation of education (due in part to: hey, where're ya gonna find your cheap labor...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0024.6
); b) shrugs at the notion of providing first-rate schools and INCENTIVES in all communities in all parts of the country (we can't afford that and anyway They don't take advantage of them); and c) has come to view education as a purely economic tool.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0024.7
Affirmative action is a symptom of failure, but until we turn that failure around, we have no right to remove a form of redress, little and late though it is.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0024.8
"Racial preference" is one of those code phrases coming out of the Right.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0024.9
The only preference I've ever seen regularly applied in this country is on behalf of whites.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0025.1
Where to begin with all the questionable statements in this discussion?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0025.2
Tartarin says "racial preference" is a code phrase from the Right and that the only preference he's seen is on behalf of whites.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0025.3
A racial preference is an advantage given to members of a racial group because they are members of that group.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0025.4
Two examples: Blacks given extra points (as at U of Mich.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0025.5

(Construction and research) · What is meant by "code phrase" ???
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0025.9
Tartarin says AA is the result of a wholly unequal educational system (k-12) and blames the "white middle-class" culture.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0025.10
I wish he would give concrete examples of this.

I do know it is liberal dems who oppose school vouchers for poor black and white parents to enjoy some of the advantages that rich people have.

My phrase "gang of the resentful" generally refers to a middle class which feels its former abundance of influence and power slipping away.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0044.2
It's understandable that the offspring of generations of people who got a better deal would feel bitterness that they are now "more equal" and indeed may have to watch as advantages they once had are given to others -- to redress injustices.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0044.3
But we have no right to pat ourselves on the back because we offer so much "equality of opportunity" when that is still blatant bullshit.

I was a volunteer in an extracurricular program at an inner-city school not so long ago for kids K-6. Much of it depended on family participation and, since many low-income AF-Am and Mexican-American kids had parents whose jobs were not M-F 9-5, and who could not come to the special activities on evenings and weekends because of their often multiple jobs, their participation was minimal or nil.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0044.5

Cambridge's school system has its heart in the right place but seems to be backing the wrong horse.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.3
It obviously wants to achieve "racial balance" but how does this educate the little kids?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.4
There is some benefit that can be ascribed to the aforementioned balance but at this point I think it only allows the child to be able to repeat the mantra:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.5
"I have nothing against poor folk, why even some of my friends are poor!"

This program is troubling because most of it is concerned with some sort of integration, which is accomplished by literally injecting "White" into "Minority" or "Middle Class" into "Poor" educational settings.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.7
This seems to miss the point of equality in public school education.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.8
In the article we find that:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.9
"Proponents of economic integration say there is ample evidence that all children learn better at schools where middle-class students are in the majority."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.10
And this from Richard D. Kahlenberg:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.11
"While there are a handful of exceptions, in general high-poverty schools don't work,..."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.12
But why is this?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.13
Later in the article we get a glimpse of cause:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.14
"Middle- and upper-middle-income parents tend to be more aggressive about making sure their schools have everything, from top teachers to special arts programs, experts said. "
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.15
Middle-class parents provide quality control,"
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.16
So maybe Economic Integration will work, but Ms. Bokhari, mother of Noah, the featured token middle class kid in the article cited as hope for this experiment intimates:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.17
"Noah would probably return to Fletcher-Maynard (the school singled out in the article) next year.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.18
After that, she is not sure.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.19
Her oldest son, Essah, a second grader at another public school where, Ms. Bokhari said, he was not sufficiently challenged, would be attending Shady Hill, a high-achieving, $14,000-a-year private school.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.20
Noah may eventually follow, she said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.22
Sounds like "Middle-Class Flight", but is Ms. Bokhari an economic bigot?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.23
No, she just wants the best Education she can afford for her children.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.24
The article also introduces us to Omar Maxwell, Noah's best friend and classmate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.25
We then learn that Omar's Mom:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.26
"Ms. Maxwell said she did not believe her son needed middle-income classmates to succeed.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.27
"It all depends on the teachers," she said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.29
So then, it's not rocket science.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.30
(I am not calling Ms. Maxwell's intellect into question here.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.31
She is studying to be a nurse, God Bless her.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.32
Alas, I cannot say the same for this school system's reasons for this program.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.33
Then we have this resultant perversion:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.34
"With all its benefits -- classes capped at 17 students, experienced teachers, the district's only full-time art teacher for kindergarten through eighth grade, computers for all fifth graders and above -- Fletcher-Maynard still has 47 vacancies.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.35
There is a waiting list of low-income children from the neighborhood.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.36
But under the plan the available slots must be held for middle-class families"
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.37
So this program, borne of economic equality, has 47 open slots for which poor kids must wait until it fills its target of kids from a wealthier background.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.38
Surley Cambridge can do better.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.39
But educator Ms. Harris is hopeful:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.40
"If we had 100 percent children of color and poor, we'd still get the job done," she said. "
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.41
You set the bar high, and they excel.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.43
I suspect these children need more academic resources applied directly on their own behalf and less of a remedy for social reconstruction that involves a:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.45
complicated lottery that takes into account family income, siblings, proximity, and -- as a last resort if a school falls out of racial balance -- race.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0055.47
As I declared before, give the younger Americans the equal education promised them and the diversity will take care of itself.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.1
Ummm..
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.2
I'm still shell-shocked by this line from the article:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.3
"Cambridge has 15 elementary and middle schools and one high school.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.4
While the city spends $17,000 a year on each public-school student, the schools' quality is considered uneven."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.5
They spend what?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.6
The top 10 school systems in the state spend an average of just over $5,000 per student per year.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.7
The school system my daughter graduated from last May (25 miles from Cambridge) was the #7 system in the state and spends an average of right at $4,700 per student per year.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.8
I'd really be interested in knowing what Cambridge is doing with $17,000 a year per student.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.9
That HAS to be a typo...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.10
Maybe it was supposed to be $7,000...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.11
Beyond that, I think they'll find the same situation in the end that Berkley High School found in the link I provided a few pages back.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.12
You can integrate the schools by whatever means you may like but in the end the kids segregate themselves within the school whether it's by race, gender, socio-economic status or any other factor.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.13
On one hand we and our schools teach our kids to note differences and catagorize but then on the other we don't want them to do it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.14
There comes a point where the schools are fighting themselves.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.15
How does a kindergarten teacher demonstrate the differences between a red block and a blue circle to their students and then society not expect those very same kids from noticing the skin color, gender, etc of the others in the room with them?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0056.16
I think the Cambridge School Board's heart is in the right place but I think we need to have a few of these systems do it for several years and look at some long term results before we play "educational experiment" on another generation of kids on a wholesale basis.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.1
Dear 'fishin:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.2
You have implicitly identified why AA in the name of diversity is the wrong approach and actually makes things worse.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.3
When society -- leaders, politicians, school administrators, etc. -- continually talk about racial differences and then implement programs and policies based on race, then the natural response is to strive for your own race.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.4
Race is magnified.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.5
Tell a black child that "whitey" is the cause of his status and he will either give up or hate whites or both.

Why would anyone be surprised that he chooses the "black" table at lunch?

Surveys over the years of HS students show "fairness" at the top of the list for teachers.

Sure, I'm over-simplfying, but neither of us are responsible for World history or American history.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.9
A baby born today should be raised to expect fairness by schools and government.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.10
S(he) should get "equal protection under the law".

I know from first-hand experience that my minority classmates could learn and excel along with my white classmates.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.12
The HS I attended was one-third black and we did not even think about race.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.13
(Well, a bit.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.14
Standards were high, graduation rates were high.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.15
I never heard of "favoritism".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.16
Something happened over the years to change this.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.17
BTW, this was a "low-income" school.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.18
I taught at a major University and I asked a black student what 10 divided by 2 was.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.19
He grabbed for his calculator!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.20
I told him never to let his batteries die.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.21
He should have been counselled to go to a community college for remedial work in Math.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.22
OR he should have been taught this in HS. AND the point is that this advice is race-neutral.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.23
Admitting students with low test-scores and then flunking them or watching them drop-out is no favor.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0057.24
Enough for now.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0058.1
Example of effects of affirmative action is the black reporter fired after 3 years in the NYT for gross plagiarism, misrepresentation, falsifying travel and other expenses, etc. All of you read his name in the news reports - how many reports did you see stating that he's black?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0059.1
HofT - IMO, it's reaching pretty far to say that AA programs were in any way responsible for that reporters misconduct.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0060.1
HofT -- I can't believe you posted that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0061.1
um, wondering if he might have been left handed as well.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0062.1
Fishin - certainly not stating any such thing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0062.2
Simply observing that it's not likely that any employee not "protected" by affirmative action would have survived for 3 years after 30+ warnings on his behavior.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0062.3
That's a hypothesis, and it's based on the extraordinary multi-page explanation published by the newspaper.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0062.4
And no, Dys, it's not a personal remark about the person, whom I don't know <G>
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.1
I'm ambivalent about AA, Dag, in the following way: To say that AA is necessary because it's needed by certain people will inevitably (in my view) make those people feel alternately resentful and inferior.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.2
To tell the truth about AA -- which is that our society has failed in particular ways and this is the broad brush we're using pro tem to address that economic and social imbalance and failure -- that's okay with me.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.3
But the underlying problem, underclassism -- in which (we are told)an underclass exists because IT has allegedly failed -- needs to be addressed straight through the culture and through a fresh look at the form of capitalism we subscribe to.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.4
Don't forget, capitalism NEEDS an underclass.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.5
Listen, I'm from a white, upper-middle-class, educated, yea privileged background, went to all the best private schools, and had parents who believed in "natural inferiority" (of others, of course!

Top of the food chain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.8
Then I lived a big chunk of my adult life outside of this country.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.9
When I came back, I was surprised at the extent and depth of the racism and underclassism in this country.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.10
It was all the more startling because it was not perceived by people who'd always lived here.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.11
On the contrary, we tell ourselves stories about the great old USA which precisely avoid facing that issue.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.12
I saw it -- and see it -- in our movies and TV dramas, in our language, in the ecology of our cities, in the ways we deal with each other socially -- B&W, rich and poor -- and to a large extent in our educational system.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.13
I agree with you wholeheartedly on the non-federal approach to this.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.14
Makes very good sense.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.15
But whatever happens, we need some national truth-telling, and we need to stop calling "them" the problem.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.16
The problem is US, through and through.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.17
At some point during the mid to late sixties I was sitting, lucky me, on my little hilltop in Spain reading a copy of the New Yorker which opened with a kind of editorial about the racial situation in America at that time.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.18
Everything that the writer said rang bells with me -- Yes!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.19
I kept thinking, I remember!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.20
-- and then I came across a paragraph which made my heart sink and which I knew to be true.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.21
It said something like this: We're having race riots and protests and eventually all those things will simmer down, but what's not going to go away for many decades [unless we make a successful effort, the writer implied] will be the resentment and anger of a people who are right to feel those emotions.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.22
These resentments on the part of the minority are not going to go away even after a "reasonable period."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.23
They are with us for our lifetimes and beyond.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.24
The reason my heart sank was because I recognized, as an American, how deep racism and "underclassicism" is, and how right the statement was.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.25
So now we're into a period when so many (non-minority) people, born in the late sixties and later, are saying, What's wrong with these people?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.26
Why are they still so mad?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.27
And that in turn creates a whole new atmosphere of oppression for the rightfully resentful...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.28
I remember the anti-gypsy attitudes and actions in Spain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0103.29
I'd have to think about it, but there are different elements in that set of prejudices...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0104.1
I fully and totally agree.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0104.2
Although I do see strong parallels between the position of some minorities (in particular areas, perhaps not in general) and the Gypsies.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0104.3
We also blame them.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0104.4
Racism is more overt over there, people and media will tell you that Gypsies don't work, because they are lazy, asocial, dirty, uneducatable...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0104.5
I believe there were similar sentiments some decades ago against blacks, and many surely still believe so, albeit not overtly.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0104.6
Gypsies were not dragged in, but they were enslaved by the local lords anyway, for they were nomads and had no status.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0104.7
They were chased away from villages, forced to settle in isolated settlements, there were hunts organized against them - much more severe than the lynching cases, for they involved hundreds of them at a time.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0104.8
The goal was to chase down and kill as many as possible.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0104.9

In 1959 they were forcefully settled - moved into cement blocks of flats, given jobs against their will and traditions and culture (everybody had to work, that was the law).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0104.11
After the communism fell, they no longer had the knowledge of their traditional crafts - basket making, blacksmithing, et...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0104.12
and the guarantee of work withered away.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0104.13
Suddenly they were left with nothing - their culture severly degenerated by the intrusion of the communist state, most of them unemployed and unable to get employed, without access to education due to systemic seggregation, etc. And that is now.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0104.14
So I believe comparisons are viable and inspiring, we can learn from mistakes and successes here in the U.S., but you can't compare the present Slovakia to present US, but to the U.S. fifty years ago.

The phrase, "No child left behind" does involve a bit of political hype, and therefore likely does deserve your criticism.

However, it is also plainly true that the pillars of the Republican and Bush educational policy are that our education establishment has become corrupt, ossified, and oblivious to its own many failures.

It needs the shocks of competition through the availability of vouchers as a matter of parent choice, and of accountability through objective testing and consequential management actions against failing schools.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6848469_0244.5
With these goals in mind, it would hardly make sense to increase the funding and autonomy of these same institutions, even though such actions could be construed to support the goals that could be assigned to the political slogan.

His equating the safety of soldiers in Iraq to the safety of the nation is really not very bright, and I am sorry to offend people, but I used an illustration of WWII to illustrate that point.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0100.6
I also understand that he is falling back onto the idea that we supposedly have won the war, and Bush opponents love to point out Bush's proclamation on the aircraft carrier.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0100.7
Yes, I understand that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0100.8
And Bush and Setanta are correct, we overthrew Hussein, and that part of the war is over, but the overall war is not, and everyone knows it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0100.9
If we had not gone to Afghanistan or Iraq, everyone has a different opinion as to whether this country would be safer now.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0100.10
As I pointed out earlier, Hillary thinks we are.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0100.11
I think we are.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0100.12
Perhaps you think we are not.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0100.13
To be fair to Hillary, she said we are safer, but I don't know if she would claim the wars made us safer or not.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0100.14
I have no clue what she thinks from day to day, and actually think she made statements in the debate that conflict with other statements she has made, which is what happens when you simply play to the audience.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0100.15
In any case, just because soldiers are in higher danger in Iraq does not prove we are more unsafe here, and to claim it as Setanta did is utter nonsense in my opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0100.16
Sorry to offend you with my opinion, but I thought that was what this forum was for.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0100.17
As far as polarizing every statement as liberal or conservative, I will try to take note of that weakness, if it is.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0100.18
Note, I changed the word, "lib" above to "Bush opponents."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0101.1
How very dense your response is.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0101.2
I did not equate the safety of the soldiers in Iraq with the safety of the nation--you and O'Bill see intent on repeating that canard, as though continually saying so makes it true.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0101.3
I simply pointed out that soldiers in Iraq being killed is at the least not evidence that Americans are safer thanks to the invasion--they are being killed precisely because they are Americans.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0101.4
You attempted to make an analogy with the Second World War, but you failed.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0101.5
In the Second World War, we fought the Empire of Japan, with more than 7,000,000 troops, and in many respects, the most modern navy in the world in 1941.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0101.6
We also participated in the war against Germany, with more than 8,000,000 troops, and some of the most modern weapons systems on land at that time.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0101.7
After less than four years, both nations had surrendered-- and after they surrendered, American civilians and soldiers were no longer killed by the Japanese or the Germans.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0101.8
In comparison, in Iraq, we faced a small army, a mere shadow of the army which had fought in the Iran-Iraq War and the Gulf War.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0101.9
We defeated their armed forces, we drove their government from power, we rounded up as many of their leaders as we could get our hands on, and we abolished the political party which had held power.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0101.10
Yet more than four years later, Americans are still being killed in Iraq, soldiers and civilians, just because they are Americans.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0101.11
Sure as hell doesn't sound safer to me.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0102.1
Nice retraction, Setanta.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0102.2
What you say is true, but also let us remind ourselves how many American died in WWII, then compare that with Iraq, with a much higher U.S. population I would also add, the comparative losses that we are suffering now pale in comparison.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0102.3
Also, if you wish to look at the comparative risks if we do not confront terrorist organizations in their staging areas, how many people could die as a result of weapons of mass destruction at some point in the not too distant future?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0102.4
Granted, we must also do other things besides confronting them in places like Afghanistan, such as controlling our borders and using intelligence work around the world and hunting them down all over the world.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0102.5
Add into it the disruption of their financial connections.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0102.6
But then again, there are the John Edwards of the world that simply think the "war on terror" is nothing more than a slogan, or an excuse to do anything we desire to do.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0102.7
I don't know where you stand on that, but as we've already discussed, I think confronting them is a better strategy than sitting back and waiting to be hit, which is what we did before 911.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0102.8
The Clinton administration treated it as a law enforcement problem, and we see how that worked.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0103.1
I didn't retract anything.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0103.2
Are you so desperate to appear clever that you have to make this sh*t up?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0103.3
Certainly far more people died fighting in the Second World War, that's a no-brainer--were fighting 30 times as many enemies, and over tens of thousands of miles of the globe--From China to Germany, the long way around.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0103.4
Your argument assumes that Iraq was or is a staging area for terrorists.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0103.5
That may be true, but if it is, it is because we have created the situation, because there was absolutely no evidence in 2002-2003 that Iraq was or ever had been a staging area for terrorist attacks on the United States.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0103.6
Following your line of thinking, we are now less safe than we were in 2002, because we have created a terrorist staging area, in your terms.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0103.7
As for the rest of it, don't try to involve me in your witless conservative propaganda screeds.

Just because she had a small problem related to drinking and driving is no reason to throw the book at her.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0211.8
Heck, if we took such a harsh stance in every such case, it's no telling who might have ended up in jail.

So if Barry needed a shot or two of something to keep going, I don't think he should be punished for that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6849434_0211.15

Bush budget lacks funds for Baghdad embassy
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.3
By Peter Cohn CongressDaily May 17, 2004 As Congress prepares to delve into the administration's $25 billion fiscal 2005 request for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, a debate also is simmering about whether and how to add funds for the June 30 transition of sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.4
The State Department will be charged with staffing, security and other startup costs for interim embassy facilities -- up to $1 billion in 2005, according to department estimates.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.5
But the Bush administration has not requested those funds in either its regular 2005 budget or in the new military funding request.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.6
That sum does not include the cost of constructing a new state-of-the-art embassy in Baghdad, which at up to $1.5 billion would dwarf the current largest State Department project -- a new embassy compound in Beijing expected to cost up to $450 million.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.7
The situation has some influential lawmakers concerned about having to shift funds around in an already tighter-than-usual budget year.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.8
"You can't send people over there without protection," said House Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Frank Wolf, R-Va., in a recent interview.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.9
"You've got to deal with that issue.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.10
We'll do the best we can to meet the needs."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.11
In a hearing last week before the House International Relations Committee, Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman said 2005 costs to operate the U.S. mission in Baghdad would amount to about $1 billion, which the administration would seek as part of its supplemental request, expected early next year.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.12
After the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1, Grossman said the agency would make do with funds appropriated in the Commerce-Justice-State spending bill until the new supplemental request is approved.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.13
Grossman said costs for July through October are estimated at $483 million, with $477 million in fiscal 2004 funds available with another $6 million through reprogramming.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.14
However, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage told the House Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee in late April the agency would be $40 million to $60 million short of the necessary 2004 funds, but that he did not anticipate legislative relief at this time.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.15
He also said continued peacekeeping needs in Liberia, Sudan and Haiti could place additional demands on the 2005 supplemental expected early next year.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.16
With the appearance last week of President Bush's 2005 budget "amendment" for the Pentagon's needs in Iraq and Afghanistan, lawmakers are beginning to examine whether the additional funds should be limited for military purposes.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.17
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said the size of the package his panel drafts could increase to as much as $50 billion and the situation on the ground after June 30 would play a role.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.18
He indicated the administration should have almost unfettered flexibility to shift funds around to meet potential needs that arise, and that his panel was unlikely to approve the funds -- likely as part of the 2005 Defense spending bill -- until a post-June 30 review of the situation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.19
House Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., also a senior member of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Subcommittee, was more specific.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.20
"I'm concerned this supplemental does not have anything in it for operating the embassy" in Baghdad, he said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.21
Kolbe said he has discussed the issue with Armitage and other White House officials.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.22
Some lawmakers are demanding assurances that adequate funds will be available or may consider adding funds.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.23
But he added that "it would set a very bad precedent" to fund embassy activities in the Defense appropriations bill.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.24
"We're looking at different ways to fund it," Kolbe said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.25
A congressional delegation led by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., that included Kolbe, Wolf, House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., met with Bush administration officials at the White House last Thursday to discuss the situation in Iraq.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0004.26
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., said embassy needs would be met in the context of the Commerce-Justice-State spending bill, but also did not rule out adding funds in addition to the $25 billion military request, arguing there is room for "substantially more" in the 2005 budget resolution, which contains an allowance for $50 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850335_0005.1
I think the only hope for the embassy is that it be built underground.

I like clean air and water.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.6
As a people, mankind has but one planet and to work in conjuction with our planet, I believe, is a wise investment in our future.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.7
As a capitalist country, I theorize our America's primary social goal is attached to status.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.8
And a primary status measure in America is financial status.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.9
Based on those personal opinions, I would further theorize, America is primarily motivated by financial gain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.10
So, when we can prove helping the environment is also financially smart, then we will see real change.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.11
"I fwwl that the GW movement is primarily a political movement."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.12
I agree.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.13
"What are the objectives of this movement?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.14
Usually the best thing to do is to "follow the money" - who benefits?"
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.16
"My theory is that GW is part of the economic warfare between China and the West."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.17
"My theory is that GW is part of the economic warfare between China and the West.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.18
I would agree because the true argument over global warming is financial.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.19
1. If West falls prey to GW then people will want to drive less or drive more efficient cars.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.20
Okay.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.21
If Western oil consumption drops then so does the price of oil.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.22
The wealthy West can afford oil at $60 per barrel but China can't.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.23
It is in China's best interest to get the price of oil down.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.24
Certainly, china's natural resources are limited.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.25
As far as affordability, I think China still owns most of the United States debt.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.26
2. If the West decides to clean up their industries then there will be a significant added expense to running manufacturing shops in the West.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.27
Perhaps.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.28
But I would like to see documented evidence.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.30
China has proven it does not care about pollution and so its economy will not be hindered or hobbled by "the clean up".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.31
True.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.32
However, I firmly believe the West does not care about pollution either unless there is profit.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.33
"3. It is known that during the Cold War, the Soviet Union funded left-wing patsies to hold protests of one sort or other to disrupt society.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.34
The Chinese can be following those examples"
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.35
I assume you mean this is common knowledge not opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.36
I would argue the West does exactly the same thing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.37
By "left wing', I think you mean hard nosed communist "right wing" political thought.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.38
Not sure of your definition of "left wing".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.39
Because of the Communist mentality split between China and the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1960s, it may be possible, but I dont think China is using the Soviet Union's model for political gain through social upheaval.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.41
The worst thing for Americans could be that Al Gore is a Chinese patsy.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.43
The worse thing for America is that ANY elected official or prominent figure would support another country's agenda to the detriment of our American society.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.44
If global warming and Al Gore's position support China, does that mean the oil industry and George W Bush's position of financial gain through that industry support Saudi Arabia?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.45
It seems like it's vague enough that it could.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0035.46
And by West, do you mean Western European based cultures or does Japan fit in to your defintion?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0036.1
@Willie cv,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0036.2

Interesting quote was that 93% of scientists in the Global Warming debate are Democrats.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0036.6
Sounds like politics to me!

What political party does the indiviual who wrote/produced the program belong to?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0038.6
Who exactly reported the political party of those scientists?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0038.7

bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0041.3
Sounds pretty unbiased and reliable to me.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0042.1
@Reagaknight,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0042.2
Yes - political affiliation is important to know because it shows potential agenda.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0042.3
If 93% of scientists involved are Democrats then you know that there is something unusual going on.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0042.4
It is an odd phenomenon worth examining further.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0042.5
Since the US is about 45% Democrat and 45% Republican and 10% Swing - I would expect 2,000 scientists to be similar political split.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0042.6
Since the the GW gang is not similar to the population as a whole I find that odd.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0042.7
It seems there is some self-selection going on in who gets into the GW club and who gets to feed at the funding teat.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0042.8
Or think of this - if someone offered you an 80,000 per year job with all sorts of nice lab equipment and travel to conferences - would you start promoting GW?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0042.9
Probably would.

Probably would."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0043.4
I would, because I believe in protecting the environment.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0043.5
But, I think the same financial incentive analogy can be said for the FDA and their funding for pharamaceutical research and development.

(a different topic all together, just used as a comparison)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0043.7
I need to watch the PBS documentary, forgive me for my ignorance regarding that film.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0043.8
Did the documentary attempt to establish a political agenda attached to GW?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0043.9
Or is that your opinion?

bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0069.2
Here is a good book
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0069.4
The New Green is the Old Red.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0069.5
The Green movement is like a Watermelon - green on the outside and red on the inside.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0069.6
The Green movement is about anti-capitalism.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0069.7
The desire is to create a world police force which will control energy usage.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0069.8
Anyone that controls energy usage controls the economies of the world.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0069.9

We stood before a mound of rotting, dead cattle, watching the greenhouse-gases escape into the atmosphere.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0072.3
We heard moaning and whimpering inside the heap.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0072.4
We held our noses, and kicked a calf-corpse over to investigate the noise.

There we were, pouring gallons of toxic waste into the gutter, drunk, stumbling about, laughing our butts off.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0073.3
Suddenly, we heard a gurgling sound under a nearby manhole cover.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0073.4
When we lifted it, guess who we saw?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850984_0073.5

HHHHAAAAAAA!!!!!!!"
bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850989_0060.1

Go hide in your bunker, then, and let those of us who are still free face the world.

But since you have no spine WHATSOEVER to stand up for your right to hate God you deserve what you have coming.

As I understand it, there will be primaries/caucuses in the traditionally early states of Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Nevada in February of 2012 (not in January).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0005.3
That could force California, Florida, New York, Maryland and Georgia to move to March or April.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0005.4

bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0007.6

bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0008.1
Ok, I'm calling it for Rick Perry, current governor of Texas.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0008.2
He refused to rule out a run when he was recently reelected.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0008.3
Because Texas pulls in very high oil revenues, Perry can claim that he cut taxes and balanced the budget at the same time compared to other governors that try that and have it blow up into monster deficits.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0008.4
Texas also came through the recession really well, again thanks in part to the oil industry.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0008.5
He can play the immigration card saying as a border governor he understands the challenges posed by illegal immigration, etc. Not sure on the religion card, but if he got elected in Texas, he's probably got a check there as well.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0008.6
Plus, no baggage from previous national runs (see Palin, Gingrich, et al).

bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0101.2
This year, 14 people on the "A2K List of Candidates" have been invited to speak according to the CPAC website and 9 have accepted.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0101.3

bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0101.5
RealClearPolitics (RCP) has an article posted today that starts with this: · "President Obama created a stir last week when he reiterated that while he doesn't support gay marriage, he still struggles with the issue.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0101.6
He said his views are 'constantly evolving."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0101.7
The gist of the RCP article is that the DADT repeal could foreshadow a deeper GOP generational shift on a number of issues, mostly in the social arena.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0101.8
The article goes on to say that several conservative groups will not be attending CPAC because the likes of the Log Cabin Republicans and GOProud (advocates of gay rights) will be there.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0101.13

I think you may be onto something about the social issues in terms of a organizational divide.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0105.5
If I was to specifically think of which issues will effect the Republican nomination, it would be as follows (in no order).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0105.6
Afghanistan (and lesser so on Iraq) - The GOP needs to form a plan on how to get out of this situation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0105.7
It's too late to really sell the idea that we need to be there forever.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0105.8
I think positive points will go to candidates that at least sound like they have a clear idea how to get out.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0105.9
This will also help in the general election with independents and moderate democrats.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873979_0105.10
Same Sex Marriage - The GOP will have to decide if they can continue to court the religious conservatives on this.

A quick look around for research on voter fraud leads me to believe that it isn't really a problem and that in the few cases where it is a problem, requiring photo IDs wouldn't have helped: <a href="http://www.truthaboutfraud.org/pdf/TruthAboutVoterFraud.pdf">http://www.truthaboutfraud.org/pdf/TruthAboutVoterFraud.pdf</a>

What makes me wonder is how differently states look at this: in Texas, a voter doesn't even have to show his driver's license or passport — he can qualify just by producing his license to carry a concealed handgun.

Since Republicans gained control of so many state legislatures in 2010, they've been working to pass laws that make voting harder.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.4
We've been asking on the show whether they've made voting hard enough, in enough places, to change the landscape in 2012.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.5
Now, from the Brennan Center for Justice, comes the beginning of an answer:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.6
The states that have already cut back on voting rights will provide 171 electoral votes in 2012 – 63 percent of the 270 needed to win the presidency.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.7
In those states, minority, student and poor voters are most likely to feel the pinch from the new rules.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.8
As many as one in four African-Americans don't have the kind of photo ID needed to vote.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.9
In Maine, after finding almost no evidence of voter fraud, the Secretary of State sent college students a letter saying they might be in violation of the law.

Executive Summary
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.19
Over the past century, our nation expanded the franchise and knocked down myriad barriers to full electoral participation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.20
In 2011, however, that momentum abruptly shifted.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.21
State governments across the country enacted an array of new laws making it harder to register or to vote.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.22
Some states require voters to show government-issued photo identification, often of a type that as many as one in ten voters do not have.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.23
Other states have cut back on early voting, a hugely popular innovation used by millions of Americans.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.24
Two states reversed earlier reforms and once again disenfranchised millions who have past criminal convictions but who are now taxpaying members of the community.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.25
Still others made it much more difficult for citizens to register to vote, a prerequisite for voting.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.26
These new restrictions fall most heavily on young, minority, and low-income voters, as well as on voters with disabilities.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.27
This wave of changes may sharply tilt the political terrain for the 2012 election.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.28
Based on the Brennan Center’s analysis of the 19 laws and two executive actions that passed in 14 states, it is clear that:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.29
These new laws could make it significantly harder for more than five million eligible voters to cast ballots in 2012.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.31
Of the 12 likely battleground states, as assessed by an August Los Angeles Times analysis of Gallup polling, five have already cut back on voting rights (and may pass additional restrictive legislation), and two more are currently considering new restrictions.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.32
States have changed their laws so rapidly that no single analysis has assessed the overall impact of such moves.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.33
Although it is too early to quantify how the changes will impact voter turnout, they will be a hindrance to many voters at a time when the United States continues to turn out less than two thirds of its eligible citizens in presidential elections and less than half in midterm elections.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0015.34
This study is the first comprehensive roundup of all state legislative action thus far in 2011 on voting rights, focusing on new laws as well as state legislation that has not yet passed or that failed.

Supreme Court throws out judgment on electronic voting machines in Texas · By Associated Press, Updated: Monday, October 3, 10:34 AM
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0017.3
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court has thrown out a ruling on the use of a certain electronic voting machine in Texas.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0017.4
The high court without comment declared moot an appeal of a ruling against Dallas County, Texas.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0017.5
That county was sued by the Texas Democratic Party over the use of iVotronic machines.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0017.6
They allow people to vote straight-party tickets, but if the voter subsequently touches any of the candidates in that party on the screen, their vote for that person is rescinded.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0017.7
Officials say the Justice Department approved the machines, but federal courts in Texas say the straight-line voting change was not explicitly approved.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0017.8
Chad Dunn, the lawyer for the Texas Democratic Party, said now the county must get preclearance from the Justice Department before using the machines.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0017.9
The high court declared the case against the machines moot since the Justice Department has now cleared the machines, and ordered another part back to court to decide a fight over attorney fees.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0017.10
Before machines, Dallas County used paper ballots.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0017.11
If a voter selected a straight ticket, and that party’s candidate, his or her vote for that candidate would count.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192784-5873990_0017.12
The cases are Dallas County v Texas Democratic Party, 10-755 and 10-1183.

@Green Witch,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0009.2
Actually I found it very difficult to find at least at the grocery store.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0009.3
I read through the entire label on one bottle (Motts) and could not find anything to indicate where the apple juice was from.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0009.4
Another was from about 5 different countries.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0009.5
Unless you have the time to go to an apple orchard or something, I am not sure how to find.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0009.6
I spent 15 minutes or more reading through the various apple juice labels - and this was just apple juice so I can't imagine other stuff.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0009.7
Although his particular study was not accurate - it does make you think - the particular concern is that China and other countries do not have the same rules in regard to pestides and that is the concern - how much and what is in these pestisides other countries are using.

@Green Witch,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0010.2
I'm very much in agreement.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0010.3
I make a real effort not to bring any food stuffs into the house that are produced in China.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0010.4
There's a frozen veggie/fruit line called Europe's Best - labelling tells us "product of China".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0010.5
Local fruits/veggies/cheese/meats as much as possible.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0010.6
It means a lot more time reading labels - if I can't figure it out, I don't buy it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0011.1
@Linkat,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0011.2
Buy organic.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0011.3
It's extremely difficult for China to be certified organic because of their practices.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0011.4
Apples are one of the most heavily sprayed crops (even in the US), so it's better all around.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0011.5
You can also contact companies like Motts and tell them you will only buy their products if they use USA apples.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0011.6
There is a movement to get large corporations to go back to our apples and if there is a demand they will listen.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0011.7
China has taken over almost 80% of the apple market and if we don't stop they will soon have 100%.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0013.1
luckily apple juice gives me heartburn, so i rarely drink it and if i do it's usually a locally or regionally pressed cider

@Linkat,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0014.2
I'm not sure you can find the country of origin.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0014.3
I'm pretty sure that apples grown in China, and juiced in, say, Washington state could be labeled "Made in USA".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0014.4
On most manufactored products, the country doing the final assembly gets the label.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0014.5
I think they could at least specify the varity of apple used.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6606858_0014.6
Most apple juice is too sweet to drink, to me anyway.

While wearing them, it's supposed to work your core muscles and assist you in maintaing proper balance and posture.

As some of you know, I'm finishing up a series of 10 Rolfing sessions (structural intergration) and it has done marvelous things for my entire body.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0001.7
As the weather cools here, I'm looking forwards to walking the trails, and would like to be able to properly use my body during all activities.

These shoes are pretty pricey ($250 and up), but, I just received a $50 visa gift card, and got a refund check from somewhere for $100, so, I'm thinking of splurging on myself for once.

Anyone?

Personally (being a former runner) I think it's another one of a series of over-hyped fads.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.2
A well made premium running, walking or athletic shoe that suits your particular running gait (pronation or supination) will suffice for exercise.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.3
There are some quite excellent premium athletic shoes for half the price.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.4
While this shoe corrects with an "unique uneven sole to encourage the correct walking gait," it can create a problem as your walking gait has been established as a habit for many years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.5
It can cause the wearer imbalance as the body attempts to adjust to the "walking uphill".

Here's another thing to ponder: if you walk at all in high heel shoes then you would be in effect defeating the therapeutic effects of the time spent in these "miracle shoes".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.10
Before I'd invest my hard-earned cash in a shoe that is double the cost, I'd see a Sports Orthopaedist and see whether or not I could benefit from a custom-made orthotic.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.11
That will help out far better than a fancy new shoe that is made for the mass consumer market.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.12
In fact, a shoe that claims to correct your gait could potentially even hurt your running/walking gait.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.13
That is what sports Orthopaedist are there for -- to advise you and make life easier for your exercise regimen-- preventing injuries and pain.

From a Chung-shi web marketing site:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.15
"Level one is the COMFORT range design with a 15% angle which is more suitable for beginners or people with joint and back problem and because of the styling of the shoes could be worn all day for work.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.16
Level two is the Balance Step range which has a 20% angle and feel more extreme really working the muscles harder suitable for power walking and improving body tone and fitness levels."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.17
Wow...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.18
that's a big incline.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.19
I'd ask the advice of an Orthopaedist, for sure!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.20
Furthermore it states: "recommend that the shoes are only worn for approximately 20 minutes a day, gradually building up until you can wear them for longer periods.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.21
At first the shoes do feel a little strange and the reflexology bar can feel quite pronounced, however it is amazing how quickly the body can adapt and they soon feel quite natural. "
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.22
If it felt really natural, it would feel good right away.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.23
Is this common sense?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.24
Your body can also adapt to pain quickly, too.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.25
Many people tried to adapt their bodies to the "negative heel technology" in those 1970s "Earth Shoes".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.26
Some folks caused lots of trips to the doctor as people caused themselves pain CREATING a gait problem where there wasn't one --- making adjustment of the "natural" alignment.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.27
If you want to try the negative heel technology at half the price the current "Earth Energetics" seems to garner positive comments:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.29
their {mbt and Chung-shi shoes} over two-hundred-dollar price tag, plus the fact that some reviewer said Earth shoes had the same negative heel technology for a much lower price, convinced me to buy a pair of Earth Energetics.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.30
I put them on the afternoon they were delivered.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.31
I must admit that it took a bit of getting used to as it felt as though I was walking uphill.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.32
Luckily, that passed quickly and I began using them while on the treadmill the next morning.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.33
I now walk two miles every single day in them and that is with my treadmill fully inclined.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.34
I love the Earth shoes so much that I bought several other styles for every day wear.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.35
I have had a problem knee in the past and found that wearing the Earth shoes seemed to prevent the occasional flare-up of pain and swelling I used to get if I overdid it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.36
I recently ordered my second pair of Energetics as I had put hundreds of miles on that first pair, and I read somewhere that you should replace your athletic shoes after 500 miles."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0002.37
Take the advice of a guy who has experienced knee and back problems and was helped immensely by custom made orthotics and a good Orthopedic MD's checkups.

I speak as someone who could barely walk after a trip where I walked a lot in San Francisco for several days - I remember it being wretched to just step off a curb - went immediately to an orthopedist after I got home to LA, and he said "see this arch"?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0003.4
and told me all about it, relative to my battered feet that had been slapping on concrete.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0003.5
That was back in the very early seventies, when running was taking off as a sport.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0003.6
If they had women's running shoes then, they weren't present in my neck of the woods.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0003.7
Following his advice, I bought a pair of the smallest men's Adidas, and my feet were "cured" - they had great arch support plus reasonable cushioning.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0003.8
I started to follow running, even as I just jogged, and read about feet...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0003.9
I'm hoping the LA Times follows the NY Times and makes its old articles free - there was a series of something like nine articles a year or two ago that were very informative about many aspects on The Foot.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0003.10
On the other hand, you may have nice medium normal feet and these shoes you are talking about would be fine for you.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0004.1
BTW, even people with healthy "normal" feet (whatever that is) can benefit from a custom made pair of orthotics and a visit to Sports Orthopaedist -- especially if you're going to be doing walking or running as a regular means of exercise.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0005.1
I know, Chai, that your interest may not be in running shoes - but this site has some handy info on feet.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0006.1
It helps when picking out the right shoes to find out if your feet toe-in or tow-out (laterally) -- supinate or pronate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0006.2
That way you can choose the right shoe as some shoes benefit one type of gait tendency over the other.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0006.3
The simplest way to determine this (your individual way of wearing and walking/running in shoes) is to examine an old pair of running shoes and check the wear pattern.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0006.4
Excessive wear on the inside of the front part of the shoe indicates over pronation, such wear on the outside of the front of the shoe indicates supination.

what I used to call supination is now called underpronation, at least on my link.

Same difference.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0008.2
Supination = under pronation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0008.3
Try not to get too hung up on figuring out terminology as a well-versed athletic shoe store (not often a Foot Locker or typical mall store) will be able to advise you by looking at the wear pattern on your shoes or a well-worn pair of running shoes and advise you accordingly.

As I mentioned above, I'm going into my 9th out of 10 rolfing sessions this Friday.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.8
I'm at the point where every muscle in my body has been worked on, and these last couple of sessions will work on more fully intergrating everything together (although each session is incorporated into the body, and what has already been done).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.9
In fact, I may take a break for a few weeks, but I've discussed with my rolfer and we both agree I would benefit from another session or two working specifcally on my chest/neck area, as my chest is my far the most tightly bound up part of me, and my neck has always been a suseptible area for problems...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.10
What does all this have to do with the shoes?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.11
Well, without boring you further, my body right now is in the best state it's been in, in I don't know how long, maybe ever.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.12
The purpose of rolfing is to open up the muscle from the fascia, and if I told you all the changes it's made in my posture, flexibility and in my core, you might think I'm embellishing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.13
But I'm not.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.14

My center of gravity going down my legs are support equally by my entire foot, not leaning back, or forward, or to the sides.

Anyway, pilates exercise, as we all know, work on the core too.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.18
However, I could never do those exercises properly, because my body wasn't aligned, and I couldn't make the movements in a proper way...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.19
In one review, it was said that the wearing the Chung Shi's was like "a pilates class in a shoe" because of the way the shoe is built, it makes you stand with your weight in the proper area...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.20
anyway, looking at it from that view, I would think that someone who is all out of whack would find it very uncomfortable, because you'd be standing in a way that is making your bound up muscle, being held in the improper position by your fascia, try to go into the proper place, but it would be unable to.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.21
I'm thinking, (and mind you, I'm only thinking) that if your muscles are opened up and where they should be, these shoes would just allow you to stand in the way you want to when you're barefoot anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.22
(No, I don't wear heels)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.23
One of the things these shoes were recommended for was for people who have, I can't remember or say the medical term, but basically screwed up fascia in their feet.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.24
One thing I have learned is that your feet are the base for every other muscle in your body.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.25
If they aren't standing properly, you may feel it in the stranges place, and not even realize it's related to your foot.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.26
My feet are opened up, and the shoe is made to open up your foot, so....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.27

She's been doing this for something like 20 years, and is an RN also, and knows every muscle, tendon, bone and ligament in my body intimately by this time, and over time, and because of what she's done for me, I put a lot of store in her opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0009.31

I don't get all the heels on the Sartorialist.com - plums balancing, oh, never mind.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0035.1
Hey, just kidding.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0035.2
I'm an Aerosoles and Naturalist kinda girl...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0035.3
oh, and Hush Puppies.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0035.4
Anything that makes my feet feel like they're in heaven...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0036.1
Sings, "You've Got to Have Friends" at top of my voice!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0036.2
Peace be with you and your shoe choice.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0036.3
This all has gotten too embattled for my blood.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0036.4
The fact is that you seems very defensive about all this.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0036.5
Well...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0036.6
You win!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0036.7
Hey, Mame.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0036.8
Did you know that there's a great website called Zappo's?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0036.9
I've bought a few pair of shoes from them over these last 2 years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0036.10
They are like the LL Bean (reputable mail-order) of shoes.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0036.11
They carry everything from recreational, casual dress, sneakers to dress shoes for men and women and kids.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0036.12
They guarantee the fit and they'll pay shipping both ways (if you return them).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0036.13
Maybe they have Feng Shwei shoes too?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0037.1
Let's say we can agree on the matter of foot comfort.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0038.1
Of course we know about Zappos...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0039.1
Chai, People who posted on this thread only wanted to provide some information that may be helpful to you, even though none of us has any experience with the shoes you asked about.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0039.2
I personally think Ragman's suggestion has a lot of merit, and worth your consideration.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0040.1
Ha!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0040.2
I just bought a pair!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0040.3
I love them!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0040.4
My worst (foot) crime: I used to wear heels when I worked in offices and one time I saw a podiatrist about all the lumps and bumps on my toes.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0040.5
Did he give me shite!!!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0040.6
I've never worn a heel to work since (occasionally to an evening event, but now I don't even want to go near them)...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0040.7
all the lumps and bumps are gone and I have a new appreciation for my feet and what kind of stress they take all day long.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0040.8
Have you heard of Fluevog?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0040.9
Now he makes shoes for your foot!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0040.10
And they're ergonomic etc etc etc...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0041.1
Shuddering in a corner....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0041.2
protecting my privates..

is it safe now?...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0041.7
can I come out?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0041.8
I'm putting on all my shoes at once and seeing if I can still balance...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0041.9
ahhhuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuum!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0041.10
BTW, I have been using a pair of Asics DuoMax's.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0041.11
Best shoe I've had in years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0041.12
My knees don't bother me with them and my back is no worse than it was.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0042.1
Next time I'm shoe-shopping, I'll have to check them out.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0042.2
Thanks for the info
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0042.4
And your privates are safe from me...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0042.5
uhh...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0042.6
you don't have multi-penii, do you?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0043.1
oh, geez, another one..
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0044.1
Ok, ok, already, I might actually like flue vog, or whatever the name is.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0044.2
Or not, snarls...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0050.1
Yeh, I'm sure I contributed to an element of arguing when it wasn't necessary.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0050.2
I guess I was obscure in the idea, clear in my own mind, that some shoes could be a poor choice for people with certain kinds of foot pronation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0050.3
I don't know that they are, just that they well might be, and that understanding about your type of pronation could be useful.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0050.4
I assume that if pronation is "normal" the shoes may be just fine; if not, yes, I might see an orthopedist for an opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0050.5
May we all have happy feet....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0051.1
Hey you guys!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0051.2
I'm here to defend the Fluevog!!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0051.3
I'm sorry if you find them ugly, Chai, but I mentioned them because I bought a pair when Fox & Fluevog had one of their first outlets in Gastown, Vancouver, way back in the hippy-dippy days...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0051.4
(we're talking early 1970's)...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0051.5
I paid the astronomical sum of $35 for a pair of their clogs (open-toed) which, when my salary was $500/month, was a lot!!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0051.6
They were the most comfy shoe I have ever worn.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0051.7
So there!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0051.8
I could afford a pair today, but like you say, they are fugly!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0052.1
Just to prove I'm not making it up
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0052.3
John and his longtime friend and ex - partner, Peter Fox, go back to biblical times.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0052.4
In those days, such scriptural characters as Methuselah lived to be, quite literally, thousands of years old.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0052.5
John, himself, is thousands of years old and Peter Fox is, in fact, Methuselah.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0052.6
Before they founded Fox & Fluevog, in the ancient biblical age of 1970, they were shepherds.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0052.7
Actually, they worked at Sheppard's, a venerable Vancouver shoe emporium, albeit a tad on the conventional side.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0052.8
As you can imagine, John and Peter felt a wee bit constrained, selling brogues all day to businessmen in suits and servicing only the occasional hipster.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0052.9
When, one day, the miraculous happened, it was followed by the inevitable: an old warehouse full of turn - of - the - century footwear (men's & women's, in mint condition, no less) became available to buy at one ridiculously low price.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0052.10
In a nanosecond, John and Peter were out the door and into their own store, fully stocked with brand new fifty year old shoes that, in 1969, were right in style.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0052.11
Fox & Fluevog immediately became the very coolest place to treat the feet and has remained so ever since.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0052.12
Around 1980, Peter heard the siren song of New York City and moved there to open his own store, specializing in design of Ladies' (particularly wedding) shoes.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0052.13
John took over the business and built it into the multinational mega corporation it is today, along the way forging his undaunted reputation for the world's most distinctive shoes.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0053.1
Wow, Mame, I'm seeing a whole new side of you!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0053.2
LOL
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0053.3
I'd like to put my.02c worth of shoe stories too, because I worked for Florsheim Shoe Company about ten lifetimes ago.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0053.4
Back in those days, we used to be able to buy shoes at 55 percent of retail, and they were really great shoes - made in Chicago.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0053.5
I still have Florsheims in my closet that still looks new, and I bought those back in the sixties and seventies.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0053.6
They're still comfortable on my feet, but I wear them only on special occasions.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0053.7
A few years ago, Florsheim Shoe Company went bankrupt, but a few months ago, the Florsheim brothers bought back the name and re-established their company.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0053.8
I wish them luck.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0054.1
Danskos woman here.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0054.2
I am going to have to look up fluevogs...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0054.3
I did try earth shoes once, in Westwood, just about ran out of the store, not so much re the ugliness, but from the cultural whappo, and my own imbalance.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0054.4
Time passes, and if people like them, fine.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0055.1
CI - why am I not shocked that you have perfectly good 30 and 40 yr old shoes in your closet?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0055.3
I would never have guessed that, but I am not surprised
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0055.5
Good for you - I wish I still had those clogs.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0055.6
That was the first purchase I made with my first paycheque as a 17 yr old working in 'downtown Vancouver' so it was very memorable.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0055.7
Plus, they had a hippy design on the leather
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0055.9
Shite, osso, now I'm going to have to look up Danskos!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0055.10
grrr...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0056.1
Hey, they sell them at a store near me, Osso...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0056.2
I'll check them out while I'm out and about tomorrow.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0056.3
Thanks for the heads up.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0057.1
Well, more about me -
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0057.2
fine leather soled shoes, such as florshiems' dress shoes, were I man, would have me on foot death's door.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0057.3
With my arch and metatarsals' failure to 'rotate', the fine sole becomes an upward battering ram.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0057.4
I also can't wear too cushioned soles - as I've found out by buying some very expensive walking shoes - my feet seem to be attempting to break with those.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0057.5
I tried on some whatchacallits once, the tough punk sort of boots, forget the name.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0057.6
My version of hell.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0058.1
Danskos are worn sort of loose..
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0058.2
no rubbies, but also not floppy...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0059.1
Florsheim's women shoe stores were called Thayer McNeil.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0069.1
Ok I just want to respond to a couple things said within this thread.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0069.2
First off..
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0069.3
Chung Shi's are exclusive to Foot Solutions in the United States.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0069.4
Secondly, you can stop in a Foot Solutions throughout the nation and try on these shoes AND try them on outside on the sidewalk.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0069.5
The reason we do the sidewalk test is so that you can feel the difference from carpet to cement.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0069.6
These shoes are made for hard surfaces and a lot of people that wear them are nurses, teachers, mechanics and etc that are standing on hard surfaces for long periods.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0069.7
Third..
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0069.8
There is a 2 week policy at our store and at almost all stores I know of [though Foot Solutions is a franchise so I can't really speak for them all] and it is not special for anyone unfortunately...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0069.9
the pedorathist that trained me are from Texas and trained at the Austin, Texas location.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0069.10
I could continue on this subject but I do not want to get into the controversy of how the shoe works for the people that they do work for.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0069.11
This is something I do all day long and while I'm at home I like to not think about work so much.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0069.12
I happened to cross this thread, however, and just wanted to clear up a couple of things.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0070.1
@Chai,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0070.2
I just puchased a pair of chung shi shoes for a heel problem.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0070.3
I've had heal pain for 4 months with nothing helping.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0070.4
I put them on a 6pm and wore them till 5 am with little or no pain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0070.5
It was wonderful.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0070.6
I could feel them work my legs but they said this happens.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0070.7
So far great shoe even though they cost so much.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0070.8
It takes a little time to get use to walking in them but I got the ones that are 15 degrees or a little less as each stile is diffrent.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0070.9
I paid $245 plus tax at foot solutions is Fargo ND.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0071.1
I have a pair of their Level 1 Comfort Step Trekker Sandals ($235) and they are NOT comfortable at all.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0071.2
I bought them from Foot Solutions, and I would have returned them if I could have.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0072.1
@bartay98,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0072.2
Thanks for posting that because I wanted a chance to brag about my own new sandals.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0072.3
I got the SAS Bravo, and it's totally comfortable right from the git-go.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0072.4
Haven't done long, hard walks in them, and probably won't.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0072.5
The places I go for walks have gravel and loose sand, which has been an issue with every sandal I've owned.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0072.6
They look remarkably like Birkenstocks, but the resemblance is superficial.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0072.7
Birkies have your heel lower than the ball of the foot.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0072.8
More comfortable foot bed, too.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0072.9
I've never been happy with that, and a name brand physical therapist confirmed my impression.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0072.10
Also, SAS uses a very soft, lined leather for the uppers.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0072.11
List at $140.00, but the local shoe store found out they couldn't move sandals at that price in this town, so I got them at $70.00.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0073.1
@roger,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0073.2
Good buy, Roger..
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0074.1
@Chai,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0074.2
Why, indeed, Chai?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607332_0074.3
Why, indeed...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.1
@loren31,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.2
Hey Loren
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.3
It is very difficult, especially with a young family.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.4
I would recommend you get these enterology tests done -(these could come back negative and inidcating IBS - which isn't wholly helpful because it does mean a change in eating habits, dealing with stress etc...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.5
this could be caused by the fact you have a lot of pain to deal with i.e. your joints, back pain etc, and especially the fatigue.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.6
If the enterologist does not come up with a definitive dx, then ask him to refer you to a rheumatologist (you call them immunologists in the USA).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.7
Ask specifically for the ESR and PV tests which will indicate "itis" - inflammation going on somewhere - ie arthritis, SLE, ulceritis - anything with an 'itis' going on with the parameters we've talked about here.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.8
RA/SLE - specific test - Rheumatoid factor (you can have RA without the factor) and anti-DNA and antiRNA tests.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.9
There are important.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.10
The C4 test you were talking about may include the usual tests I have here - CRP (reactive protein), AST (Liver Function Test) and ALK (alk phospate) - these are strong indicators for inflammatory arthritis type symptons and connective tissue disease, incorporating SLE.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.11
Also the base RBC, WBC neutrophils, eosinophils etc. (bog standard blood tests).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.12
The first mentioned are very specific tests and "pretty routine" - all they need to do is take a few extra vials (mine are 8 at a time).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.13
Other than that, I would really push for reassurance about the chest pains...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.14
that would be my priority if I were you...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.15
You haven't described the pain, could these be anxiety pains...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.16
worrying about what's wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.17
Whatever it is, you need to see someone soon about that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.18
with your diet and bloating - try cutting down on your carbs - bread, pasta, cereals with wheat, bread...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.19
that sort of thing...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.20
dairy produce...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.21
try maybe for a couple weeks and see if it makes a difference.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.22
Carbs make a huge difference to IBS if that what it could be.

(sorry if this comes over as preaching - don't mean it to sound that way)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.24
I'm here a lot of the time and there are many posters with experience in various symptoms to glean information from.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.25
Just talk when you wish to.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.26
Don't accept the doctor saying "don't know what the answers are"...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.27
you have quite specific symptoms that sound all too familiar...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.28
so try and push them - have a list of questions to ask them and be strong, look them direct in the face and wait for them to answer.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.29
Maybe if your partner/hubby can go with and he can "back up what you're sayng" to the doc and to basically, hold your hand - give you a little strenght.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.30
If not, a friend.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.31
Anyone who you are comfortable with and supported by to accompany you and who can also ask questions if you are struggling to say what happens when you get sick- it's sometimes better when there is a back up so it doesn't sound like your whole body is falling apart and being whiney - someone independent can tell it like it is to the doc.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.32
I know too well the looks I get when I am always sick...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.33
in fact, people are so bored of my umpteenth surgeries etc, it's now easier not to discuss it (tho I whine with folk here).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.34
Somehow, you have to find a place inside your head that says - "unless you are well, you cannot look after the kids to the best of your ability, the way you wish to and it's hard for partner/hubby too" - therefore YOU must be well, you must put your health needs first, so you can then do everything/some things that are expected of you as partner/mom/daughter/sister/ etc....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.35
TAKE CARE OF YOU FIRST -then you will be stronger for them.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.36
Do remain calm - and if you wanna talk...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.37
carry on.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.38
Also, I know I said it before - but keep a positive focus that this will not beat you - do all that you can when you can, and when the fatigue cracks you - no matter what - you have to rest.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.39
OK....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.40
give it a go until you see the doctor (it may seem selfish and believe me, with kids and partner, the guilt you feel is the worst - BUT YOU MUST NOT LET IT!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0012.41
Sending you strength and best healing wishes.

Small quibble, Iz.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0013.3
I ran a clinical lab and later was supe in a research lab for the rheumatology department at a university in the US, and much of the work we did could be described as immunology.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0013.4
The docs were, as a generalization, rheumatologists, some also phDs in this and that, one a researching orthopedist, one a hematologist as well.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0013.5
But the board certs were primarily in rheumatology.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0013.6
Later I worked at a major clinical lab for immunology - the owner was a rheumatologist and phD. · I am behind the times on the laboratory aspects, so I have no useful comments on present days testing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0013.7
I'm glad Loren has had a chance to talk with both JPB and Izzie.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0013.8
Good smart women.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0013.9
I suppose I could be wrong, heaven forfend, re board certs in immunology.

@ossobuco,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0014.2
Thanks for clarifying that Osso.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0014.3
Yep, in Boston I was with a rheumatologist and when we moved to CA I was transferred to an immunologist at Stanford Uni - mainly coz I was real sick then but also undergoing IVF treatment in San Jose.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0014.4
Yep yep, you're quite correct.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0014.5
Rheums can and should be able to do all the tests I said above for sure, if they deem it necessary.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6607570_0014.6
That's who, if she can get the referral, whom she should aks to see.

Noddy, you always say the very thing that evokes strong reactions in me.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.2
m-girl - This is not in a scolding way....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.3
but let me tell you something about the reactions of people when they hear "oh, but I didn't want to worry you"
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.4
My brother died when he was 34, and I was 30.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.5
I only found out literally hours before he was dead, although he had been in the hospital for days before that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.6
If it hadn't been for a phone call I initiated shortly before he died, I wouldn't have know until after he was dead.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.7
To add insult to injury, the phone call I made was to tell my family I just got engaged to be married.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.8
This was the conversation: · Me: Hi!

Well, guess what!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.15

bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.24
Her: Your brother's in the hospital and he's not going to last the night.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.25
Beyond the immediate shock, I was made to feel like a complete a$$hole, but that's besides the point.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.26
Later, after the funeral and all that, I sat down and asked her why she didn't let me know what was going on, so I could've come to see him (we were close).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.27
I didn't want to worry you.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.29
Now, don't you think that should have been up to me to decided whether or not I should be told something?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.30
Not saying you're going to die or something, but your mom is a grown woman, an adult, and deserves the opportunity to make up her own mind whether or not this is something she should worry about.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0074.38
you are a grown up, not a little girl....

bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0075.3
My mum had a go at me about curtains a few weeks back.This makes me think if i tell them something medical she will blame me for it, its a criticism I can really do without.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0075.4
I do see what you are saying tho.There reaction was alot more calm than i predicted.

I really understand.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0076.9
Remember though, you are NOT to blame for what is happening to you, and even if you were, that's not something you parents should scold you about.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0076.10
If I may say...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0076.11
sounds like you mom has a control issue, and feels it necessary to lay blame for everything she doesn't like....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0076.12
of course not on herself (unless it's to guilt trip you)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0076.13
Stand fast mg....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0076.14

I adore my mum, she isnt one of those monstor mums you hear about, we get on very well at times, but sometimes she does say things that are impossible to respond to in any way that will have a good outcome.It really gets to me.Im sure she doesnt realise she is doing it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0077.3
eg re my lack of social life--'Your wasting your life'.Not helpful at all, youd think she'd give me a list of places I can go.

re me adapting a dress-'It would be a shame to spoil it'.Because obviously Id be ruining it and not making it look better.

re curtains-'Passers by might not like the way it looks'.I dont give a f*** about what other people like the look of,surely my opinions are more important.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0077.6
If I reply how Id like she will act hurt and threaten to leave.Wether I hold my opinions in or let them out its very negative for me.

Does your mother have any grandchildren?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0078.3
If so, remind her of her grandmotherly possibilities.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0078.4
If not, the next time she makes one of her managing, maternal comments ask her how she would feel about you being an unmarried mother who visited a sperm bank.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0078.5
Ask her whether she'd prefer a boy or a girl.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0078.6
Ask her whether you should go for Nobel Prize sperm.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6609431_0078.7

The dose you described for zoloft is a low one.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0015.1
The 0.5mg of clonazepam is the standard starting dose.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0015.2
As Snood says - it's a sedative and can be addictive.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0015.3
Your recommended starting dose of Zoloft is very low - so don't expect great things at that dose.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0015.4
There's often some irritating side effectss to start - but these go away!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0015.5
It's not addictive, but a certain percentage need to taper off slowly - so it's usually suggested that everyone does.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0015.6
You should be discussing these issues with your doctor - some people need help, and drugs are only one way.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0016.1
I'm ignorant of all the compounds ascribed to work.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0016.2
Mostly I have applauded a lot of them, via hearsay, especially zoloft for my · 101 year old aunt (long story.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0016.3
On the other hand, I just read (and I suppose I saved the article) re how hard it is to get off this stuff.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0016.4
Given that getting off is any kind of question, I'd go for low dosage, watch and wait.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0017.1
pretty much second what snood said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0017.2
long term use of an ssri leads to tolerance, so you need to increase the dose to maintain the same effect, and if you decide to quit, you have to taper off, rather than stop abruptly.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0017.3
it's standard practice to start taking ssri at a dose so low that there may not be much psychological effect (excluding placebo effects that is).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0017.4
but this is wise IMO because if you start with a full dose the side effects might not be tolerable.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0017.5
again, as snood pointed out, there are many ssri alternatives; i've taken a couple of them myself.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0017.6
it so happens i could tolerate the ones i was prescribed, but many people can't.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0017.7
on the other hand, i have no experience with benzodiazeprines, but my impression is that they're powerful substances, so it might be wise to put them aside for emergency use.

finally, good luck flushd, and keep us posted.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.1
Zoloft literally saved my life flushd....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.2
it also gave me back such a huge portion of my life that I'm forever grateful the drug was developed.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.3
I've spoken before about my anxiety attacks here, so won't go into detail expect to say they were daily and were preventing me from having any sort of life.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.4
I was given the same dosage to start, 25mg to increase to 50mg hold there if it worked, or increase, etc.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.5
I am extrememly sensitive to any kind of drug, and was frightened to take a "whole" 25mg, so the phychiatrist said for me to split them for a day or two, then proceed....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.6
anything to get me over my resistance and started on the med.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.7
Anxiety, physically, is your body raping itself of its seritonin.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.8
It uses up all your seritonin, looks for more, which you can't produce fast enough, so you become anxious/panic.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.9
It was important for me to know this as I could visualize the battle going on and how I could fix it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.10
Zoloft is a SRRI - Seritonin Reuptake Inhibitor.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.11
It creates a block, a wall between the cells so one cell can only take so much seritonin at one time, and allows the other cells to produce a normal stockpile....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.12
now this is not medical talk of course, but it helped me.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.13
I was warned my anxiety might actually Increase temporarily, as my body was trying to grab the seritonin, and couldn't get it, and freaked out.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.14
Don't worry, that's temporary.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.15
Then, you will start to normalize, and remember what it is like to relax, concentrate and enjoy things you had cut out of your life.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.16
Fact is, when I split that 25mg pill for a few days, I felt weird for a couple days, a little dizzy once in a while, a little jumpy, then felt fine, increased to 25, then 37.5, then 50, etc. · Somewhere in the beginning, like at 25, I experienced my last panic attack, which I feel was induced by the increase, since it happened in the middle of the night....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.17
I'll be honest, I wanted to chuck the whole thing then, but thank God I didn't.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.18
After that, everything started to improve.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.19
Personally, I'd say don't worry about the flat affect side effect they talk about.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.20
I went through a time, a few weeks where nothing bothered me, nothing excited me as far as happiness, but internally, I was a walking cacoon of contentment.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.21
I thought of it as my "Zoloft Holiday".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.22
I in NO WAY felt drug, I just was feeling this huge relief of being able to sleep, eat a meal, and interact with others.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.23
Soon enough, when your body recovers, you'll be the person you used to be, but new and improved.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.24
I've been on a maintenance dosage of 150mg for 4 or 5 years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.25
I have no desire to taper off since my anxiety comes from roots from decades ago, and I don't think my body could ever regulate myself properly.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.26
When I've forgotten a dose here or there, I can feel it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.27
Important for me to note...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.28
the Zoloft is not drugging me, it's correcting a chemical imbalance in my brain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.29
Hope I didn't bore you flushd, but I thought relating a personal story might help you.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6610506_0018.30
Yes, discuss with your physician, and I can undertand your hesitation, but it can be a really really good thing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0007.1
That brings up an interesting question, shewolf.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0007.2
Is it easier to quit 'cold turkey' or by cutting back?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0007.3
Probably depends on the person but I was in the turkey camp.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0008.1
I was too.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0008.2
Because, I am an 'extreme' personallity style cold turkey was right up my alley
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0008.3
Either way, it takes a bit of resolve to stay there.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0008.4
AS I have not..
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0008.5
I think..
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0008.6
and just M-O-, tappering off gives you room to make excuses to keep lighting up.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0008.7
The all so typical - Im only smoking 2 a day now, that isnt dangerous-
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0008.8
or..
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0008.9
- I just need to taper off a few more weeks to ensure I wont start again-
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0008.10
i say, just do it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0008.11
Dont prolong the withdrawls.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0008.12
Just do it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0008.13
but thats me
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0009.1
quiting smoking is very easy, I do several times every day.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0010.1
An ex boss would quit smoking occasionally but what she did was quit buying.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0010.2
She'd bum from me or someone else until she'd eventually cave in and buy some more for herself.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0010.3
I was a regular smoker for many, many years but quit when I became pregnant for the first time.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0010.4
I was never a heavy smoker but I smoked every day, mostly in the evening after work.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0010.5
My two sisters have one clear breath in the morning when they first wake up.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0010.6
There's nicotine in every subsequent breath.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0011.1
Pregnancy was what stopped me for almost 2 years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0011.2
a funeral gave me excuse to start again.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0011.3
I am honestly not looking to quit now.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0011.4
I have always been a 3 cig a day smoker.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0011.5
More, only if I have a beer to go with it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0011.6
but 10+ years of smoking and I have never EVER gotten worse.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0011.7
I give..
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0011.8
im a smoker for life right now.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0012.1
I'm the same way but it's more like three packs a year.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0012.2
My first response to major stress is to want a cigarette.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0012.3
Every so often I'll buy a pack, smoke one or two cigarettes to feel better and then stick the pack in a cupboard.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0012.4
I'll finish the pack over the course of a month or two and then not smoke again until I buy the next pack a few months later.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0013.1
wow..
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0013.2
i wish i could do that!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0014.1
Smoking a two month old cigarette isn't very rewarding, I'm just too cheap to throw them away.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0015.2
I feel ya sistah......
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0016.1
I really tried to quit for a decade.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0016.2
I'd quit for a week, a month, a few days...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0016.3
I finally got a Rx for Wellbutrin, and I haven't smoked for a year and seven months.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0016.4
<well, I puffed about eight or none cigs since then, but none in the last year.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0016.6
I swear, I feel so much better.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0016.7
All over.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0016.8
I visualize pink lungs.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0016.10
Maybe some helpful aids, flushd?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0016.11
Quitting will be so good for you.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.1
flushd....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.2
there's good news and bad news....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.3
If you stay quit, the urges will become less and less.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.4
You've probably heard this before, but it really is like riding a wave.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.5
It will be like your floating along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.6
I can't remember how long exactly, but the strong part only lasts a few minutes, like less than 5. If you can get past that a few times, you've put some notches in your belt.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.7
At first the waves come often, then, they fewer and fewer, and less and less strong, while at the same time your feeling of accomplishment gets stronger and stronger.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.8
Can you ask your friend not to smoke around you?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.9
If she's a good friend, she'll take it outside.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.10
The bad (well not so bad) news is, once you've successfully quit, all of a sudden, even years later, you'll get this sudden nostalgic urge.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.11
For me, it would be situational, I'd be in a great mood, doing something enjoyable, and I'll see or smell someone smoking and my brain will say "Remember how good a cigarette was when you used to do this"
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.12
However, when that happens, I'm able to laugh and myself and shake it off.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.13
It is just a momentary thing, like a minute, and you realize how yucky the cigarette would actually be.it's sorta like suddenly remembering an old lover.it's fun to think of him for a minute, but you're not going to go on a quest to find him.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.14
BTW - the Wellbutrin is an excellent idea....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0017.15
talk to your dr. about it, it really does work.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0018.1
flushd, as someone who doesn't smoke but has had relatives go from lung cancer -- I (we all do) care about you and want you to be healthy and around for a long time.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.1
Stupid cigarettes
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.2
Stupid cigarette smokers.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.3
Stupid higher health insurance rates for me because I have to foot part of the premiums for the stupid smokers and their stupid health problems due to their stupid "choice"
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.4
Stupid stink that hangs around them, their cloths, hair and vulture breath.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.5
Every morning when I come into the office, there's anywhere from 1 to half a dozen people standing their 15 feet or whatever it is from the front door, stinking up the immediate area.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.6
For months, regardless of how many were there, I'd say "Good Morning" to the individual or group.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.7
(different subject, but I have a real thing about greeting people when I first see them in the morning, before launching into the business of the day.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.8
Even if it's a friendly "hey!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.9
How are you?")
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.10
The response would either be..
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.12
Or.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.14
Then a slow awareness would come to some eyes, and there would be a muttered.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.15
"yeah.hi" from a couple of people, while the others remained in a fog.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.16
One day, I thought I'd give them the opportunity to say something first.that was back atoh xmas time.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0038.17
Since then, it's just been the apathetic stares of people whose brains are so clogged up they don't even know enough to say good morning.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0039.1
I got to work the other day and six people were outside the back door smoking...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0039.2
I punched in and was throwing down the last of my bagel when the manager came in and said "I know you're not eating that bagel on the clock" I asked if all the people smoking had already clocked in, which they had, and went back to my bagel.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.1
BVT, 3-4 packs for 30 yrs?!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.2
My god man, you are lucky to be alive and well right now!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.3
And I'm so glad you are and you quit.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.4
That is very inspirational.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.6
I'm still smoke free.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.7
Excepting I tried a herbal cigarette w/ clove and that was gross.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.8
So forget it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.9
Ehh...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.10
tycoon...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.11
I think you made a good point about the smell of the smoke.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.12
Yes, it is still appealing to me, and that worries me a bit.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.13
A part of me still wants to be a smoker, it's true.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.14
That was very observant.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.15
I wonder what makes it so it becomes offensive.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.18
Possibly a switch of mind and mentality?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.19
chai..
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.20
hehee.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.21
That picture is perfect!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.22
I guess as a smoker we really can come across that way....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.23
i've seen that before and tried to repress that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.24
Yesterday was such a weird day for me.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.25
I work in support/advocacy, so I'm often being sent or roaming around different parts of the city to see people.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.26
Most times it's poorer areas, etc.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.27
well, yesterday I had most of the day on my own time, just had a few things to do, and decided to go see a few folks i used to work with, check out how they were doing as I'd heard they were doing alright and i'm friends with one of guys who works with their family.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.28
So, yeah, I picked up some Tim H. coffee and I'm waiting to get a call to let me in.....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.29
and I see this girl, maybe 18 or 20 or so, with a baby and a toddler and a cigarette hanging out of her mouth.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.30
She was wearing a cropped top that showed her stretched-out baby belly and jeans that looked like they belonged to a 12 yr old.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.31
It was so sad.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.32
I won't go into it too much, but I wanted to cry for her.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.33
I helt her toddler for a few minutes while she lit her smoke, and chatted for a bit.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.34
Today I've been seeing things really differently, and I think a lot of it had to do with her.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.35
So many people in my field and who i work with smoke, the people we work with smoke at a very very high rate, so it's usual to offer them a smoke and sort of form a bond and get them yapping that way.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0040.36
This whole long story = I finally am starting to associate Smoking W/Sickness and pain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0041.1
Smokers are becoming pariahs, there is little doubt about that trend.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0041.2
For my part I wish peer pressure, rather than city-wide smoking bans in public and private businesses, would continue to push smokers to give up the habit.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0041.3
(Chai Tea's admonishments are ten times more effective than city council proclamations, IMO.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0041.4
Flushd, I'm glad to hear you had a positive day.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0041.5
I really have no further advice to help you, though I wish I did.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0041.6
I'm not sure when the smell of smoke became disagreeable to me, but I believe ex-smokers can detect the smell better than non-smokers.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0041.7
I quit before my wife did and recall smelling the residual smell of smoke on her several feet away.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0042.1
I noticied something flushd, you said "we" smokers can come across that way.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0042.2
Switch the mind set to "I'm a non-smoker"
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0042.3
Why do you become aware of the odor?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0042.4
Because you can finally smell it and you realize it STINKS!!!!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0042.5
I can see the prettiest girl or woman, but if she gets near me and I smell smoke, I just can't think of her as attractive anymore.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0042.6
IMO, she doesn't look as intelligent anymore either.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0043.1
I mentioned a yoga book earlier.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0043.2
It was 1965 or so.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0044.2
I wish something would change her mind....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0044.3
we're going to miss her when she dies young....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0045.1
Thanks for the input guys n' gals.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0045.2
Perhaps the mind will follow the behavior if I simply continue not smoking?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0045.4
It is true I still think of myself as a smoker..
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0045.5
even though I'm not actually doing it...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0045.6
that's weird.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0045.7
I need to work on that: the mental aspect.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0045.8
Hmm, well if Ms. Squinney ever decides to kick the habit, she will definetly have a lot of people 'having her back'.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0045.9
I know I would.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0046.1
I just HAD to bump O'Bill's thread.

My sister was a smoker as a teenager-- the kind that lit up and had a cup of black coffee with it for breakfast.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0047.2
She decided she would quit when she turned 30.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612054_0047.3
She went to a hynotist and hasn't smoked since, and it's been a lot of years.

Hi, since bout a year after I started secondary school I've been getting this shoulder pain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0001.2
I think it was started by carrying my school bag.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0001.3
Now I have reached my last year at 2ndry school and my shoulder pain's become really severe.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0001.4
I only get it when I've been carrying a bag (not neccessarily heavy), or am stressed etc. I've been to the drs and got prescribed this cream 'Movelat' bout 1 2 2 years ago.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0001.5
It didn't have any effect, so after my mum not booking me an appointment for AGES
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0001.7
she finally did and I got an appointment to c a physiotherapist...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0001.8
now I went to physio appoint bout 6 weeks ago and the stupid cow didn't seem to believe I actually had anything wrong, or expreienced pain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0001.9
I hurt my back/shoulder on trampoline bout three to four weeks b4 and, then, my dr said I had tenderthingy or something like that!...?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0001.10
So physio did all the arm movement things to see if I got pain that's usually connected to tenderthingy and I din't have it then, it doesn't usually hurt from moving my arm anyway...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0001.11
I just really need some sort of advice, has anyone else experienced something like this?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0001.12
Or does anyone know any way I could help it?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0001.13
Thanks...

I developed shoulder pain from carrying a large purse/book bag, that sustained over a period of approximately six months, but not severe enough to need medication.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0002.2
One of my doctor's main suggestions, aside from putting an end to carrying heavy weight, was to buy a new bed pillow.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0002.3
I was really surprised at how much it actually helped to alleviate the discomfort and pain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0002.4
Don't really have any advice to offer, just trying to help.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0002.5
I hope you find some answers.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0003.1
Years of landscaping, including plenty of stonescaping, has left me with permanent shoulder and collarbone pain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0003.2
Tia is correct that a proper pillow can really help.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0003.3
I sleep with a large firm pillow that actually puts my upper body higher than my hips.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0003.4
When my pain is really bad I cannot raise my arms high enough to french braid my hair and I learned an exercise that helps: Stand in a corner of a room, face into the corner, brace your hands on opposite sides of the corner, palms flat on the walls, slowly arch in your back, butt out and press your chest into the corner where the walls meet.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0003.5
Your chest does not touch the walls, you just lean into the place where the walls meet.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0003.6
Hold, straighten and push forward again.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0003.7
If I do this for a couple of minutes it seems to put whatever is out of wack back into place.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0003.8
The fact that you fell off a trampoline might mean you fractured something.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0003.9
but you would need an x-ray to confirm that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0004.1
Thanks, I have been looking for a new foamy mattress and supporty pillow, but my mum said she'd buy me one...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0004.2
but that was about two months ago and the dehumidifier to get the damp outa my room was 4 months ago and the heater for the freezing cold winters was bout year and half ago....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0004.3

bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0004.4
Anyway, I can't really stop carrying my bag, my history file and bout 3 or 4 heavy books really kill my shoulder, then if I try to leave a couple at home my crazy history teacher has a go...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0004.5
I can't win...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0004.6
No, I'm all better now after the trampoline incident...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0004.7
the most recent one that is....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0004.8
it's just this shoulder pain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0004.9
First my dr prescribed me 84 ibuprofen, to burn my stomach lining away, and help with the pain of course.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0004.10
The my physio said 'Stop taking the ibuprofen, that won't help.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0004.11
' God, what does SHE know?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0004.12
Stupid cow.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0004.13

I hurt my right shoulder and wrist slipping on the floor of a restaurant as we were being led to the table.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0005.2
No we were not in the bar first.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0005.3
It took a while but the shoulder has been giving me a lot of trouble and it has been about 8 months since the accident.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0005.4
The thing that helps me out is exercise with light (5 lb) free weights.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0005.5
I checked with my doctor first, because I didn't want to compound the injury.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0005.6
Tlhe doctor told me that a painful muscle is a weak muscle and apparently she was right.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0005.7
I took a class and also got a dvd called "weights for dummies".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0005.8
It's not too strenuous but it does strenthen the muscle.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0007.1
Perhaps you have tendinitis near the armpits (feels like shoulder pain).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0007.2
If you get it scanned by ultrasound, a doctor may find the culprit, and prescribe what's needed.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0008.1
Mmmm. Glitterbag....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0008.2
did you sue?!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0008.3
Yeah, I was thinking ultrasound-wise coz that would also break up any calcium deposits and get the blood flowing better...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0008.4
Thing is, I've started getting this different pain now, it's sorta moving round, so sometimes I get pain at the front of my shoulder and it's more...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0008.5
I dunno, maybe muted, but still as painful, if you know what I mean, less sharp...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0008.6
I'm a bit worried that it's getting worse...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0009.1
No honey, I didn't sue.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0009.2
It's a big pain in the butt to sue someone.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0009.3
Besides, what I do is worse.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0009.4
I tell everybody in the area about the incident and let them decide if they want to take a chance in high heels on a too-slick floor.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0010.1
Mmm I'd say that's pretty reasonable...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0010.4
I've come off milk and dairy stuff now coz of suspected lactose intolerance.....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0010.5
it's a pain in the a**...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0010.6
but my shoulder pain has mysteriously gone away...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0010.7
it does come back occasionaly when I'm really stressed out...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0010.8
but only mildly and only for a little while....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0010.9
Touch wood....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0010.12
but anyway...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0010.13

bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0011.1
Start carrying your bag in your arms like a baby or get one of those bags that are more like suitcases.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0011.2
Just don't carry it on your shoulder anymore!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0011.3
You gotta prevent more pain from coming on.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0011.4
Start swimming.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0011.5
Great exercise.

I was lifting people around all day.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0011.9
I learnt the hard way what the human shoulder is capable of and what it is not.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0011.10
All medicines and exercises and beds won't help if you keep aggrivating the area.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0011.11
You gotta rest it up and take care of yourself.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0011.12
Bottom line.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0012.1
Wear a backpack type of purse; they make plenty of them in various styles.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0012.2
It has helped my shoulder a lot.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0012.3
When I do get a flareup (usually from typing on this thing too much!) I go to an acupuncturist - they work wonders!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0012.4
Also, as flushd suggested, swimming- or kayaking, if you live near the water - helps immensely.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0012.5
Good luck.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192794-6612754_0013.1

And NBC is airing interviews with Murray which were taped before the verdict was reached

Jackson Doctor defends self in NBC broadcasts · LINDA DEUTSCH, AP Special Correspondent · Wednesday, November 9, 2011
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.5
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The doctor convicted of killing Michael Jackson never testified at his trial, but he is now defending himself in multiple NBC interviews taped just days before a jury returned his guilty verdict.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.6
NBC's "Today" show planned to broadcast interviews with Dr. Conrad Murray in which he defends his use of the surgical anesthetic propofol to put Jackson to sleep.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.7
Although multiple experts testified at his trial that propofol should not have been administered in Jackson's home, the doctor disagreed.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.8
"I think propofol is not recommended to be given in the home setting," Murray said, "but it is not contraindicated."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.9
He also said Jackson had been using the substance long before the pop star met Murray.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.10
The interview with the Houston cardiologist, who was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter Monday, is set to air Thursday and Friday.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.11
NBC released excerpts of the interview Wednesday.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.12
Under questioning by the "Today" show's Savannah Guthrie, Murray said it was not necessary for him to monitor Jackson because he had given him only a small dose of propofol, and he said that was the reason he didn't mention it to paramedics when they arrived at Jackson's mansion.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.13
"That's a very sad reason," he said, "because it was inconsequential — 25 milligrams and the effect's gone.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.14
Means nothing."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.15
Guthrie asked, "Well, you told them about the other drugs, but you didn't tell them about propofol?"
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.16
"Because it had no effect," Murray said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.17
"It was not an issue."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.18
The coroner would subsequently find that Jackson, 50, died of "acute propofol intoxication" after a huge dose of the drug complicated by other sedatives.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.19
Murray's defense tried to show that Jackson gave himself an extra dose of propofol while Murray was out of the room, but prosecution experts said there was no evidence of that and it was a crazy theory.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.20
Asked by Guthrie if he became distracted by phone calls, emailing and text messages, Murray said, "No I was not."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.21
"When I looked at a man who was all night deprived of sleep, who was desperate for sleep and finally is getting some sleep, am I gonna sit over him, sit around him, tug on his feet, do anything unusual to wake him up?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.22
No," Murray said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.23
"You walked out of the room to talk on the phone?"
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.24
Guthrie asked.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.25
"Absolutely, I wanted him to rest."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.26
He insisted Jackson was not on an infusion that would stop his breathing and, "I was not supposed to be monitoring him at that time because there was no need for monitoring."

Other doctors testified at Murray's trial that leaving a patient alone after giving him an anesthetic was an egregious deviation from the standard of care expected of a physician.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.28
In one exchange, Murray suggested that had he known that Jackson had a problem with addiction to medications he might have acted differently.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.29
Experts testified that he should have researched Jackson's medical history before he undertook his treatment for insomnia.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.30
On the day Jackson died, June 25, 2009, Murray said he believed he had weaned the singer off of propofol, the drug Jackson called his "milk."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.31
But when Jackson could not sleep, Murray told "Today," he gave the entertainer a very small dose of propofol.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.32
In retrospect, he said he probably should have walked away when Jackson asked for propofol.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.33
But he said he would have been abandoning a friend.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.34
Meanwhile, the disclosure that MSNBC will air a documentary about Murray brought outrage Wednesday from the executors of Jackson's estate, who said Murray is getting a prime-time platform to smear Jackson's reputation without fear of cross-examination.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.35
The executors, John Branca and John McClain, demanded the program entitled "Michael Jackson and the Doctor: A Fatal Friendship" be cancelled.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.36
The network said it had no comment.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.37
Murray, 58, was hired by Jackson at a promised salary of $150,000 a month to accompany the singer on his "This Is It" concert tour to London.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.38
A jury that heard six weeks of testimony convicted Murray of involuntary manslaughter.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.39
He is now being held in Los Angeles County Jail awaiting sentencing Nov. 29 and could face up to four years in prison.

Oh, he tells the police he had given Jackson IV propofol for what, 40 or 50 straight nights, but we are supposed to believe that he didn't do that the day MJ died?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.42
And we are supposed to believe that he had weaned MJ off the drug, at the same he was ordering 4 gallons of it to be used on Jackson?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.43
And, if Jackson was weaned off it, why would he have suddenly impulsively self-administered it?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.44
And Conrad Murray must have been the only person on the planet who didn't know MJ had a long-standing problem with prescription drugs.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.45
Dr Murray is not a very good liar.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0188.46
He could never have weathered a cross-examination if he had taken the stand in his own defense.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0189.1
@firefly,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0189.2
In his taped interview with the police he said he "was weaning" MJ off the propofol and he had given it to him for the past twenty nights.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0189.3
I think the doctor would be better off keeping his mouth shut from here on out.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0189.4
He only contradicts his taped interview with the police.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.1
There are at least two civil actions for wrongful death that may prove to be even more interesting than Conrad Murray's criminal trial.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.2
The Jackson family has long contended that MJ's death was the result of a conspiracy that involved AEG, the production company behind MJ's upcoming tour, who were also the people who had contracted with Conrad Murray to provide physician services to Michael Jackson.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.3
So, in addition to Joe Jackson's wrongful death suit against Conrad Murray, Katherine Jackson, on behalf of Jackson's children, has filed a wrongful death suit against AEG.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.4
This will force all sorts of hitherto undisclosed details out into the open, and that should prove very interesting.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.6
After Dr. Conrad Murray’s conviction of involuntary manslaughter, Michael Jackson’s family is now shifting the blame of the singer’s death to the Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.7
Katherine Jackson and her grandchildren are pressing a wrongful death suit against AEG in civil court.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.8
The case will likely be tried in September.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.9
The case will involve many of the same issues as the criminal trial of Murray, according to the L.A. Times, but will also talk about Michael Jackson’s finances and years of drug abuse, which were deemed irrelevant to Murray’s case.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.10
"The conviction of Dr. Murray is just the beginning of bringing forth the truth on what happened to Michael Jackson," Brian Panish, an attorney for the Jackson family, told the L.A. Times.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.11
"Forces much larger than Dr. Murray were involved in this tragedy."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.12
Jackson family lawyers have not specified how much money they are seeking.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.13
In court papers the Jackson family portrayed AEG as a “heartless, bottom-line-driven business that contributed to the singer’s death by pressuring him to prepare for performances that he wasn’t physically capable of pulling off,” according to the L.A. Times.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.14
The documents argued that the pressure pushed Jackson to Murray and the use of propofol.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.15
AEG Live CEO Rand Phillips denied pressuring Michael Jackson into a comeback tour during his testimony at Murray’s trial and said that Michael Jackson was desperate for money.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.16
Michael Jackson “wanted to settle down and get a really, really good home for his family, for the kids.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.17
He said they were living like vagabonds," USA Today reports Phillips said in his testimony.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.18
His testimony refuted claims that AEG was pressuring Michael Jackson into a tour he did not want to commit to.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.19
AEG also denied accusations of attempting to control Jackson.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.21
Michael Jackson was not helpless or incompetent; he lived in his own home, negotiated his own contracts, engaged his own attorneys, and cared for his own family," lawyers for the company wrote to the L.A. Times. "
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.22
He at all times retained the option of refusing Dr. Murray's services, or of canceling his agreement with AEG.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.24
Three AEG company officials who testified at Murray’s trial said that Murray was a good doctor who had nothing but the best interests for Jackson.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.25
The civil trial by Katherine Jackson and her grandchildren filed in September 2010 does not name Murray.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.26
A separate civil case filed by Joe Jackson in November 2010, however, could hold Murray liable for medical malpractice, according to ABC.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.27
The cases may be combined.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.28
The trial will focus on money, according to the L.A. Times.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.29
AEG advanced Michael Jackson’s money against future concert earnings and had the right to seize his assets if he failed to preform 50 shows in London.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.30
The tour had the potential to erase Michael Jackson $400-million debt, according to Betty Confidential.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.31
At the time of his death, AEG was paying for his rented mansion, his personal chef, his entire staff and production expenses.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.32
Michael Jackson was going to have to reimburse AEG $30-million for personal expenses.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.33
The tour was sold out, so neither parties were concerned, reports Betty Confidential.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.34
Katherine Jackson told the L.A. Times that the relationship between AEG and Michael Jackson created a legal duty for AEG to “treat him safely and not put him in harm’s way.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.35
” She claims AEG breached this duty when contracting with Murray who was only interested in making sure Michael Jackson could perform.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.36
AEG, however, testified during Murray’s trial that Murray was Michael Jackson’s personal choice and they wanted to hire a British doctor, the L.A. Times reports.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.37
AEG never paid Murray, according to the L.A. Times.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0211.38
The case will also seek to answer if AEG knew propofol was being used on an outpatient basis and if AEG knew the risks behind the drug, ABC reports.

I might be a waste of time but I'm the one who insisted the case was money driven and I'm the only one on this thread who brought up the issue referred to in this--
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0212.3
to prepare for performances that he wasn’t physically capable of pulling off...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0212.4
The whole massive issue of performance enhancing drugs is involved.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0212.5
And not just in relation to athletes.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0212.6
And I'm the only one to mention insurance as well.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0212.7
There was a large amount of money invested in MJ's ability to perform at the age of 50 and with a drug ravaged body.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0212.9
And I'm the only one who mentioned that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0212.10
In such circumstances I don't trust anything I see or read unless it is spontaneous physiognomic reaction.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0212.11
And I still think that Mr White's assertion that he wouldn't have done what Mr Murray did for any amount of money was inadmissible.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0212.12
And that the sustaining of an objection to consider other treatments MJ was subjected to was unfair at best.

To say there is no debate is plainly ridiculous.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0364.5
It is you who is not debating because I put up a post and you haven't debated with it but instead reverted to blustering as if viewers here will thereby not notice your omission.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0364.6
I have thus proved you are not debating and you have only asserted that I'm not.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0364.7
That I am talking to myself is proved false by my posts causing reactions.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0364.8

bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0365.6
If he let other people dictate to him when he'd sing, etc., I am sorry, but that was his fault.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0365.9
None of that has any bearing whatsoever on the fact that Dr. Murray CHOSE to compromise medical ethics and in doing so, someone died and now Dr. Murry will have to pay his consequences just like MJ did.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0365.10

My longer post earlier today was an attempt to explain why medical ethics could have been adhered to at the time the Propofol was administered.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0366.6
The best interests of the patient in all the circumstance might have been the consideration rather than the instructions on the bottle which are there to reduce the liability of the manufacturer and those who administer the drug in hospitals and which always err on the side of caution.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6702474_0366.10

A manager in a local supermarket was investigated for allegedly abusing his seventeen-year-old son, a local football star.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0054.14
And if he tried to stop her, she would turn him in for sexual abuse.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0054.15
The N.C.O. did nothing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0054.16
His rationale was that his career in the service would be ruined.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0054.17
The common strand in all these situations was that the allegations were found to be false.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0054.18
The clinical psychologist spent $50,000 in his defense, lost his practice and most of his friends (Spiegel 1986).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0054.19
The second clinical psychologist spent nearly $35,000 in Juvenile Court in his defense (criminal charges were never filed).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0054.20
Both psychologists reported suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and depression.

The Problem
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0054.32
The National Study of Child Abuse (Smith, 1985) estimated that 1.1 million child abuse and neglect reports have been filed with Child Protective Agencies each year and that more than 600,000 of these probably cannot be substantiated even using the broad definitions of child abuse and neglect often used by the protective service agencies.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0054.33
Of the remaining 40%, only half (or 20% of the total reports) were considered substantial enough to be included in the national study (Smith, 1985).

From Kirkus Reviews · A psychologist castigates his own profession for its role in false sexual abuse claims that have put innocent people behind bars, ruined families, and damaged patients in therapy.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0055.2
Campbell, a member of the Professional and Scientific Advisory Board of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, has previously published portions of the present work in a number of peer-reviewed journals.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0055.3
Here, he first examines the role of anxious parents, ill-informed health-care professionals, and overzealous prosecutors in legal cases involving false allegations of sexual abuse.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0055.4
He describes numerous disturbing cases, some that have been well publicized and others that have not, to reveal the error-prone procedures for assessing child abuse and the way in which play therapy for children can dramatically alter their memories.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0055.5
Next, he looks closely at the practice of recovered memory therapy, in which therapists persuade adult clients that their troubles originated in childhood sexual abuse, memories of which they have repressed.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0055.6
Campbell contends that recovered memory therapists, who may be doctoral-level psychologists, not just marginally trained practitioners, are bringing discredit to psychotherapy with their use of the blame-and-change approach (clients in therapy must blame family members in order to change themselves) and their persistence in clinging to misinformed theories about memory and repression.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0055.7
Campbell, who cites studies showing that therapists rely much more on subjective impressions than on scientific research, charges that within the American Psychological Association and other member organizations, political correctness and marketing concerns prevail over ethical responsibility and accuracy of information.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6703828_0055.8
In his final chapter, Campbell outlines the changes that he thinks psychotherapy must make, the likelihood of which he finds remote.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6706556_0012.2
I would have to say to murder another human being is mentally ill also, but they still are held responsible for their actions.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6706556_0012.3
Under these circumstances I would not think that they should be considered legally insane.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6706556_0013.1
That's a good point - it is both a crime and an aspect of mental illness.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6706556_0013.2
But like the difference between this and chaining a dog up without food or water for three weeks there seems to be a huge difference with intent.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6706556_0013.3
The hoarders seem to see themselves as rescuers of these animals and really think they're helping - they don't think about the real consequences of their actions.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6706556_0013.4
Really, it's like we treat drunk drivers who kill someone different that we treat someone who intentially murders.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6706556_0013.5

As dragon pointed out, people often line up to adopt these animals when things like this happen and I've often wondered why. The shelters are already full of animals -- if they were wanting a pet why didn't they just go adopt one?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6706556_0019.3
Maybe the animal shelter should go rent a house, set it up with some nut and a bunch of cats, go in a week later and "bust" them and thereby reduce the number of pets in the shelter.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6706556_0019.4
The Tufts site has a lot of interesting information including that these hoarders often work in "the helping professions" like nurses, or at a vet's office, that sort of thing -- that unlike Debra's cat lady, you would never know that they had such a compulsion.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192821-6706556_0019.5

Jena 6 teen's return to jail draws queries · Judge's probation ruling called 'revenge'
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6758982_0037.3
By Howard Witt | Tribune senior correspondent · October 13, 2007
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6758982_0037.4
HOUSTON - Civil rights leaders and juvenile justice experts on Friday sharply questioned the legality of a judge's surprise decision to send back to jail a black teenager whose prosecution in a racially charged case helped inspire a massive demonstration in the small Louisiana town of Jena last month.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6758982_0037.5
Attorneys for Mychal Bell, 17, said they would quickly appeal the decision made late Thursday by LaSalle Parish District Judge J.P. Mauffray to revoke Bell's probation and sentence him to 18 months in juvenile detention on two counts of simple battery and two counts of criminal destruction of property.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6758982_0037.6
Bell's juvenile convictions on those charges preceded and were unrelated to a Dec. 4 assault on a white student at Jena High School for which Bell and five other black students, known as the Jena 6, are still awaiting trial in a case that national civil rights leaders say exemplifies unequal treatment of blacks in the mostly white town.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6758982_0037.7
Mauffray's ruling Thursday night came just two weeks after he was forced to release Bell on $45,000 bond after the teenager had been jailed for more than nine months on the Dec. 4 charges.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6758982_0037.8
A Louisiana appellate court overturned Bell's aggravated battery conviction in that case on the grounds that Mauffray had improperly allowed the youth to be tried as an adult.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6758982_0037.9
The appellate court ordered the case back to juvenile court.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6758982_0037.10
"This is judicial revenge," said Al Sharpton, one of the civil rights leaders who have taken up the Jena 6 case.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6758982_0037.11
"The judge was already defeated once by the appellate court, and now he's taking his frustrations out on Mychal Bell."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6758982_0037.12
It was unclear why Mauffray decided to send Bell to jail on the prior charges.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6758982_0037.13
The judge has ordered all the proceedings in Bell's case to be closed and directed all the lawyers in the case not speak about it publicly.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6758982_0037.14
Other experts on Louisiana's juvenile laws said that Mauffray's decision to jail Bell on the earlier charges appeared to run counter to the state's juvenile statutes.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6758982_0037.15
"I don't know the motivation for this judge and the district attorney, but what they did goes against the grain of our own juvenile code, which holds that home and the community is the best place to treat juveniles," said David Utter, an attorney and founder of the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6758982_0037.16
Utter is representing one of the Jena 6 defendants.

Has anyone heard about this?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.2
It has been getting a lot of playtime in Milwaukee lately.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.3
It is a national campaign that wants people to stop snitchin' on people who commit crimes.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.4
It was apparently started by some thug in Baltimore
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.6
The whole gist is that you can't trust the cops so you shouldn't snitch on people when you are a witness to a crime.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.7
Ironically, it also calls for people to snitch on those good citizens that do snitch to the cops.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.8
Anyway, the matter has come to attention in Milwaukee lately in light of two seperate cases.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.9
There was a beating of a man, <a href="http://graphics.jsonline.com/graphics/news/img/feb05/beating020605.jpg">Frank Jude</a> , by some off duty police officers in October of 2004.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.10
Progress was slow in arressting people for the beating because of a "Code of Silence" among police officers.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.11
They are just now in the middle of a trial and even though they do have some witnesses against the police officers there are a lot more that still are not talking.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.12
The sescond case is two missing boys that have gone missing for over two weeks now.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.13
Police are convinced that there are people who know something, but no one has come forward with any information.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.14
They think that the Stop Snitchin' campaign has something to do with it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.16
Now, in light of the "Code of Silence" and the Frank Jude beating, it is interesting to me that, perhaps, some people do have reason to not trust the police.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.17
However, is this any reason to allow crime to continue in your neighborhood?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.18
It is two strange counter-productive activites.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.19
The cops want people to come forward with info, but they themselves have a code of silence and while people who Stop Snitchin, even in light of not trusting police, are doing nothing but making their own neighborhoods unsafe and keeping two kids from their own neighborhood from being found.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.20
It is a pretty sad statement of the times, IMO, that things have gotten so bad.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0001.21
Cops above the law and criminals glorified over law abiding citizens.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0003.1
There was a fairly large to-do about a bunch of "Stop snitchin'" T-shirts here in Boston over the winter.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0003.2
The state was claiming that they were being worn by gang members while they sat in the gallery in courtrooms with the intent of intimidating witnesses.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0003.3
The mayor of Boston (Mumbles Menino) tried to have the sale of them banned but that was laughed out of discussion pretty quickly.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0003.4
From Wikipedia: · "In Boston in December of 2005, faced with a murder rate at 10-year high, mayor Thomas Menino announced that he would begin confiscating Stop Snitchin' shirts from local stores.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0003.5
Though Menino rapidly backed away from mandatory confiscation to endorse voluntary removal of the shirts by store owners, his proposals sparked considerable controversy locally and nationally.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0003.6
Though many saw the initiative as ineffective, counterproductive, or misleading, some community members of high crime inner city areas such as Dorchester defended the move as important to conquering fear on the streets and assisting in criminal prosecutions."

What is even MORE · bothersome to ME PERSONALLY...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0004.4
is the police using known · criminals via threats to get convictions on other people · who they may know nothing about.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0004.6

bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0004.7
But the police HAVE TO DO SOMETHING, · don't they?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0004.8

WHY WOULDN'T ANYONE SAY WHATEVER · THEY TELL THEM TO SAY??
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6761586_0004.10

Lionel Tate who killed the 6 year old girl in while 'imitating a wrestling move' pleaded guilty to second degree murder yesterday.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6766365_0001.2
He served three years in lock up, now he is on one year house arrest and ten years probation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6766365_0001.3
Lionel was 14 years old at the time and weighed 166lbs., she was 6 and weighed 48lbs.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6766365_0002.2
Hardly.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6766365_0002.3
He didn't just "imitate a wrestling move".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6766365_0002.4
He kicked, punched and stomped her as well during a sustained beating, resulting in a fractured skull and a host of internal injuries.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6766365_0002.5
His mom, who is now in charge of the house arrest, was upstairs at the time of the murder.

The kid is a monster with no respect for human life.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6766365_0002.7
His mom has already demonstrated her incompetence (she had yelled down the stairs "keep the noise down" while the murder was taking place).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6766365_0002.8
It is likely only a matter of time until he hurts someone else.

Syria seems to have dropped out of the group of 'newsworthy' Mideast locations since the death of Hafez al-Assad, the father of the present-day president.

He was an Alewite, and -- as the CIA site provided by Sofia indicates -- the Alewites are a miniscule minority in Shi'ia-dominated Syria.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0004.5
It's like having a Presbyterian president in Italy.

The Ba'ath party is the dominant force in Syria as it was in Iraq under Saddam Hussein.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0004.7
What's interesting is that Assad and Hussein were sworn enemies in spite of their membership in the same party.

Syria backed Iran during the Iraq-Iran war.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0004.9
even though the Syrian republic is quite secular while Iran at the time was ruled by the Ayatollah Khomeini.

If that ain't enigmatic, what is?

During the Gulf War, Syria allied itself to the American-led forces to defeat Saddam.

I personally believe that Syria wants very much to get on our (USA) good side.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0004.13
They would certainly benefit from trade with the USA and I think the current situation in Iraq has given them a good scare.

I don't know how sizeable the Kurdish population is, but they are very conspicuous, unlike the handful of Jews whom you would have difficulty in finding.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0004.22
My understanding (imperfect, I'm sure) is that there is no active persecution of Jews in the country.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0004.23
But they are not allowed to leave Syria, not even to study abroad.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0004.24
The fear is that any Jew who gets out of Syria to, say, Switzerland or France or the US, will find his/her way to Israel and add one more gun to the army guarding the Golan Heights.

They went to sleep as Syrians and woke up stripped of their citizenship and their rights to study, work, or marry as they wish.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.5
Such was the fate of 120,000 Syrian Kurds who became people with no country in 1962, when they were purged from the Syrian population in a politically motivated one-day census, the Washington, D.C.-based humanitarian group Refugees International said in a new report Tuesday.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.6
Today, their ranks have swollen to 300,000 and their plight is such that one Syrian Kurdish man interviewed by the group described it as "like being buried alive."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.8
The Kurds disowned in 1962 officially were branded "foreigners" but since they enjoyed citizenship nowhere else, they were condemned to statelessness.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.9
They have only spotty access to education, health care, and employment--rights enjoyed by other Syrians, the report said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.10
They face difficulty in owning businesses and property.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.11
"Even registering a marriage, traveling outside of the country or changing one's residence is a particular challenge for Syrian Kurds," Refugees International said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.13
Those hardships are faced not only by the generation written off in 1962 but also by their heirs.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.15
The government recognizes Kurdish children's right to primary education but stateless Kurds face trouble getting into secondary school and college, according to Refugees International.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.16
Stateless Kurds also are barred from government jobs and from practicing law or medicine.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.17
They are allowed to work in some, but not all, teaching and engineering jobs.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.18
Stateless Kurdish men cannot legally marry Syrian women, according to the report.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.19
Kurds are barred from using their language in conversation, publications, and in the naming of their children.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.20
They face interrogation, detention, and torture, according to the report.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.21
All this is the result of a 1962 census officially conducted to identify foreigners said to have crossed the border from Turkey illegally, Refugees International said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.22
In fact, it added, the head-count formed part of a drive to 'Arabize' Syria's resource-rich northeast.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.23
''To retain their citizenship, Kurds had to prove residence in Syria prior to 1945, but many Kurds with proof of residence lost their nationality anyway,'' the organization said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0017.24
The issue has haunted Syria and periodically has spilled over into public protest, regional uprisings and, in 2004, major race rioting sparked by a soccer match, according to rights watchdog Amnesty International.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6670315_0018.1
Elsewhere in the papers, meanwhile, we hear of the Dutch Immigration service allowing a Syrian government delegation to come to Holland and question Syrian deportees (some of whom rejected asylum-seekers who risk persecution if the Syrian state finds out they applied for asylum) - oh, and when the Syrian state reps asked if all Dutch officials could please leave the room while they had a talk with these people one-on-one, the Dutch of course swiftly agreed.

If I had to guess I'd say Marrakech and Tangier and possibly Agadir?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6671340_0010.4
When we visit, we visit family mostly in and around Rabat (the capital) but we have done the tourist thing and during those times it was very helpful to have at least one Moroccan handy to tell the "attachers" to get lost.

Well, at first, after a historic meeting with Abbas, on July 25, President George W. Bush referred to Israel's separation wall - dashing through the West Bank - as a "problem."

JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israel on Monday declared an "all-out war" against Hamas and said it is freezing diplomatic relations with the Palestinian Authority unless the Palestinian leadership takes "tangible steps to deal with infrastructures of terror."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.10
Following an Israeli Cabinet meeting, a statement cited Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz as saying the August 19 bus bombing in Jerusalem had "broken the track that was supposed to give the diplomatic process a chance."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.11
Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed 21 people.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.12
The Israeli statement came as Israeli military helicopters fired missiles at members of Hamas on Monday in Gaza City.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.13
Israeli security sources said an Israeli helicopter fired on "a car loaded with arms...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.14
killing two Hamas military activists."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.15
They were identified as Khader Housari, 40, and Munther Kanitha, 32.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.16
Palestinian sources said one Hamas member was killed and conceded that doctors said a second Hamas member was "clinically dead."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.17
Twenty-five people were wounded in the attack, according to Dr. Mauia Abu Hasanin, director of the Shifa Hospital emergency room.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.18
In addition to Monday's strike, Israeli helicopter attacks during the past two weeks have killed 10 Hamas activists and wounded more than 50 Palestinians as part of an Israeli strategy to target suspected terrorists.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.19
Monday's statement from Israel said it has adopted the following positions:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.20
 "An all-out war against Hamas and other terrorist elements, including continuous strikes at the organization's leaders";
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.21
 "Pressure on [focuses] of terror" in the West Bank; and
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.22
 A freezing of "the diplomatic process with the [Palestinian Authority]...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.23
unless [Israel] sees that the PA is taking tangible steps to deal with the infrastructures of terror."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.24
Since the Jerusalem bus bombing, the statement said, Israel had carried out "five targeted eliminations" of Hamas members and stepped up operational activities in the West Bank.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.25
"The security establishment is preparing for the possibility of a security escalation and renewed wave of terror against Israel," the statement said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.26
There has been no immediate reaction to the declaration by the Palestinian Authority or the the militants groups.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.27
Palestinians have previously said that the Israeli strikes keep them from bearing down on militants staging attacks on Israeli targets.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.28
Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas has been under pressure to convince militants to end their attacks after a June summit with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and President Bush to move forward the U.S.-backed "road map" to peace.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.29
On June 29, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades -- the militant offshoot of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement -- announced a temporary cease-fire on Israeli targets, which was followed by seven weeks of relative calm in the region.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.30
All three groups are considered terrorist organizations by the U.S. State Department.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0176.31
Following the Jerusalem bus bombing and Israel's targeted killings of two Hamas militants, all three Palestinian groups announced an end to their self-imposed cease-fire.

There will never be peace over there.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0178.1
That's the same conclusion I've arrived at too!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0178.2
They're going to keep killing each other until hell freezes over, because both sides are right and wrong, and they'll never agree where that line is.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.1
Back out?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.2
This is partly our creation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.3
When isreal realized that the Palestinians have no real viable alternative to Arafat they tactically removed him and we played along.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.5
Or, when Israel and the US realised Arafat is a terrorist himself, with no ability or desire to make peace with Israel, they looked for a viable alternative.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.6
We propped up a leader that was not recognized by popular support among it's people in order to sideline the one who is.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.8
or, they tried to find a Palestinian, who does want peace and who was more likely to try to achieve it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.9
Now Isreal has it's wish.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.10
As long as they are allowed to get away with the sidelining of the only Palestinian that the Palestinians recognize they will hold the key to avoiding the "painful concessions" in their hands.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.11
I don't think the concessions Israel had already agreed to, and the several steps they made toward conciliation can be dismissed fairly.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.12
It's somethign I worried about very much when they started this campaign to sideline the only Palestinian who could have signed an agreement with Palestinian support.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.13
Arafat had made no progress, and didn't seem to be interested in progress.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.14
Many picked up on the lie.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.15
It was obvious that with Arafat in physical isolation that the complainst by Isreal that he was responsible for all the terror were illogical.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.16
What was Arafat's excuse for all those years before the isolation?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.17
Craven, when Israel checked out Arafat's compound, they found weaponry and documents supporting Hamas.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.18
How can anyone doubt Arafat's allegience to terrorism, and his unbending will to eradicate Israel?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.19
He could not be both irrelevant and the problem.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.20
He was the problem, which deemed him irrelevent to solving the problem.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.21
But with this lipservice of wanting to make peace many allowed this tactical move to become accepted.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.22
It is hard for me to believe that you view Israel as not wanting peace.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.23
Arafat was making bold moves.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.24
He condemed the terrorism in what was a groundbreaking move.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.25
When Isreal demanded a few weeks of calm Arafat helped make it happen.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.26
Isreal's response was to reply to teh weeks of calm with an assasination and to then sideline Arafat.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.27
I'll have to research this sequence.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.28
The tit-for-tat sequence has been very reliable.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.29
Now we get to watch.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.30
Isreal has managed to, yet again, use the terrorism as a pretext to avoid making what they call "painfull concessions" and what the world calls acting within the boundaries of law.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.31
I still have hope.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.32
But if this really falls through watch for continued violence and the continued expantion of Isreal.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.33
No hope here.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.34
I strongly believe things are about to get very, very bad.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.35
See, for some reason many americans seem to think that as long as there are Palestinian extremists who murder Israelis that Isreal is justified in killing even more Palestinians under the guise or retaliation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.36
That's not half as bad as the fact that few people demand that Isreal stop it's most obvious crime with the systemetic settling of Palestinian land.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.37
It's an act of war that is tolerated only because the Palestinian murderers are less tolerable.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.38
I hope no one finds Palestinian life less valuable than any other.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.39
Israel was in the process of giving back land, with agreements to give back more · The stupidity of this game is infuriating.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.40
When we decide to give up and let them go at it what it means is we resign ourselves to watch Isreal grow.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.41
I don't think Israel will use the coming violence to expand.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.42
I think they will realize public opinion concerning their overkill wouldn't tolerate an expansion.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.43
Isreal suffers terrible atrocious acts.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.44
They respond by killing more innocents and stealing more land.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.45

bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.46
Their great crime is existing in their current location.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.47
They don't deserve to be targeted for that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.48
They have been giving up land, and agreeing to give up more.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0186.49
The solution to this equation is a simple one and it's heartbreaking to watch political concerns trump the issues of loss of life and bloodshed.

I refreshed and see your predictions, Craven and think you are correct that Arafat will suffer assasination or expulsion.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0239.3
If it happens I think it will be when the US public supports the idea to a degree that the administration would not be able to put much pressure on Israel.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0240.1
I'd like to expound on my prediction.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0240.2
With US diplomats on the way to pressure Israel there is some mumbling about building a prison around Arafat instead of exiling him.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0240.3
What many fail to realize is that exiling Arafat might not be an option.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0240.4
He might be killed and that would be even harder on Israeli PR.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0240.5
The US is still against the move and IMO the only way we will see Arafat exiled is immediately after a terrorist attack.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0240.6
If there is an attack with more than 10 casualties I believe Israel might make the attempt within the 48 hour window of the aftermath.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0241.1
Waiting for an attack sounds like Israel's MO.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0241.2

bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0241.3

Israel to expand settlement
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0258.3
Israel has launched a tender for the construction of 550 new homes in Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0258.4
Almost all the houses will be built in the ultra-Orthodox settlement of Beitar Elit, near Jerusalem.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0258.5
The announcement comes a day after the government agreed plans to build protective fences around several West Bank settlements.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0258.6
About 400,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, in settlements widely regarded as illegal under international law.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0258.7
The Israeli housing ministry says this decision is part of its policy to create more housing across the whole of Israel, not just the occupied territories.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0258.8
It was, according to a spokesman, intended "to develop the communities in accordance with their needs and natural growth".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0258.9
Despite international laws banning settlement in occupied areas, Jewish settlement building has expanded continually since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, increasing rapidly in the late 1970s when the current Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, was housing minister.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0258.10
The pressure group Peace Now said the latest decision showed the housing ministry was acting as "a master planner for the settlers".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0258.11
Housing Minister Effi Eitam is a member of the far-right National Religious Party, which has close links with the settlers.

The main backer of that peace plan, the United States, had expressed concern, so for now Israel is not going to join up the new section with the old.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192909-6674527_0258.15
But the BBC's Jannat Jalil - reporting from Jerusalem - says many Palestinians are worried that Israel will delay the move until US President George W Bush is distracted by his re-election campaign.

Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt 1901–1909
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.4
On September 6, President McKinley was shot while at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.5
Initial reports in the succeeding days suggested his condition was improving, so Roosevelt embarked on a vacation at Mount Marcy in northeastern New York.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.6
He was returning from a climb to the summit on September 13 when a park ranger brought him a telegram informing him that McKinley's condition had deteriorated, and he was near death.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.7
Roosevelt and his family immediately departed for Buffalo.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.8
When they reached the nearest train station at North Creek, at 5:22 am on September 14, he received another telegram informing him that McKinley had died a few hours earlier.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.9
Roosevelt arrived in Buffalo that afternoon, and was sworn in there as President at 3:30 pm by U.S. District Judge John R. Hazel.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.10
Roosevelt kept McKinley's cabinet and promised to continue McKinley's policies.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.11
One of his first notable acts as president was to deliver a 20,000-word address to Congress[51] asking it to curb the power of large corporations (called "trusts").
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.12
For his aggressive attacks on trusts over his two terms, he has been called a "trust-buster."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.13
In the 1904 presidential election, Roosevelt won the presidency in his own right in a landslide victory.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.14
His vice president was Charles Fairbanks.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.15
Roosevelt also dealt with union workers.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.16
In May 1902, United Mine Workers went on strike to get higher pay wages and shorter workdays.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.17
He set up a fact-finding commission that stopped the strike, and resulted in the workers getting more pay for fewer hours.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.18
In August 1902, Roosevelt was the first president to be seen riding in an automobile in public.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.19
[52] This took place in Hartford, CT. The car was a Columbia Electric Victoria Phaeton, manufactured in Hartford.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.20
The police squad rode bicycles alongside the car.

(The reference includes a photo of the event.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.22
In 1905, he issued a corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, which allows the United States to "exercise international policy power" so they can intervene and keep smaller countries on their feet.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.23
Roosevelt helped the wellbeing of people by passing laws such as The Meat Inspection Act of 1906 and The Pure Food and Drug Act.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.24
The Meat Inspection Act of 1906 banned misleading labels and preservatives that contained harmful chemicals.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.25
The Pure Food and Drug Act banned food and drugs that are impure or falsely labeled from being made, sold, and shipped.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.26
Roosevelt was also served as honorary president of the school health organization American School Hygiene Association from 1907 to 1908, and in 1909 he convened the first White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.27
The Gentlemen's Agreement with Japan came into play in 1907, banning all school segregation of Japanese, yet controlling Japanese immigration in California.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.28
That year, Roosevelt signed the proclamation establishing Oklahoma as the 46th state of the Union.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.29
Building on McKinley's effective use of the press, Roosevelt made the White House the center of news every day, providing interviews and photo opportunities.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.30
After noticing the White House reporters huddled outside in the rain one day, he gave them their own room inside, effectively inventing the presidential press briefing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.31
The grateful press, with unprecedented access to the White House, rewarded Roosevelt with ample coverage.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.32
He chose not to run for another term in 1908, and supported William Taft for the presidency, instead of Fairbanks.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.33
Fairbanks withdrew from the race, and would later support Taft for re-election against Roosevelt in the 1912 election.

List of federal judges appointed by Theodore Roosevelt
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.35
Roosevelt appointed a record 75 federal judges.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.36
Roosevelt appointed three Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States: Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. (1902), William Rufus Day (1903), William Henry Moody (1906).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192956-6535368_0002.37
In addition to these three, Roosevelt appointed 19 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 53 judges to the United States district courts.

Pakistan ought to overpower the West Indies, India should subdue the Aussies, the Proteas are supposed to trounce the Kiwis, and the Sri Lankans ought to extinguish England's flickering flame.

Ricky Ponting needs everything to fall into place, his fast bowlers to hit the mark, his spinners to take wickets and his batsmen to rotate the strike.

Despite the prevailing gloom, it's not inconceivable.

bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490046_0076.18
Unlike my school where they were taught that homosexuals were sick devil spirit ridden souls that were gonna burn in hell.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490046_0076.19
Take this scenario.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490046_0076.20
A man leaves his girlfriend and the mother of his kids...
bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490046_0076.21
He marries another woman.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490046_0076.22
His children are given to him because of abuse by the girlfriend/mother.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490046_0076.23
(Yes heteros sometimes abuse their children) After a while he finds out that his new wife is a lesbian and does not love him.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490046_0076.24
Then he realizes he is bisexual.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490046_0076.25
He finds a man who adores him and loves his children as his own flesh and blood.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490046_0076.26
But the schools only recognize the marriage he has with "a woman" (who is not even the mother) who does not really love him nor does she care for his children from the other woman.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490046_0076.27
They don't even kiss and deep inside he is hurting for someone to complete his life.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490046_0076.28
Yet the narrow Maine marriage law based on bigotry is standing in the way.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490046_0076.29
So the law says he is better off with a lesbian wife who doesn't love him or his kids (cuz marriage is only between a man and a woman) than to be with a man who loves him and would share fully in his parental duties.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490046_0076.30
So if he were to leave his lesbian wife for a man he might lose his children.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490046_0076.31
Does this sound fair?Would the kids be happier with two fathers who love them than a man and woman where only one parent REALLY loves them?

bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.1
Let's look at what the US EPA says on its site:
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.2
Scientists know for certain that human activities are changing the composition of Earth's atmosphere.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.3
Increasing levels of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide (CO2 ), in the atmosphere since pre-industrial times have been well documented.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.4
There is no doubt this atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is largely the result of human activities.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.5
Nevertheless, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated there was a "discernible" human influence on climate; and that the observed warming trend is "unlikely to be entirely natural in origin."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.6
In the most recent Third Assessment Report (2001), IPCC wrote "There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.7
As atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases continue to rise, scientists estimate average global temperatures will continue to rise as a result.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.8
By how much and how fast remain uncertain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.9
IPCC projects further global warming of 2.2-10°F (1.4-5.8°C) by the year 2100.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.10
This range results from uncertainties in greenhouse gas emissions, the possible cooling effects of atmospheric particles such as sulfates, and the climate's response to changes in the atmosphere.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.11
The IPCC states that even the low end of this warming projection "would probably be greater than any seen in the last 10,000 years, but the actual annual to decadal changes would include considerable natural variability."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.12
IPCC cautions, "Complex systems, such as the climate system, can respond in non-linear ways and produce surprises."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.13
The fundamental scientific uncertainties are these: How much more warming will occur?
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.14
How fast will this warming occur?
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.15
And what are the potential adverse and beneficial effects?
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.16
These uncertainties will be with us for some time, perhaps decades.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.17
Global warming poses real risks.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.18
The exact nature of these risks remains uncertain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.19
Ultimately, this is why we have to use our best judgement - guided by the current state of science - to determine what the most appropriate response to global warming should be.

Human activity has been increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (mostly carbon dioxide from combustion of coal, oil, and gas; plus a few other trace gases).
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.22
There is no scientific debate on this point.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.23
Pre-industrial levels of carbon dioxide (prior to the start of the Industrial Revolution) were about 280 parts per million by volume (ppmv), and current levels are about 370 ppmv. The concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere today, has not been exceeded in the last 420,000 years, and likely not in the last 20 million years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.24
According to the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES), by the end of the 21st century, we could expect to see carbon dioxide concentrations of anywhere from 490 to 1260 ppm (75-350% above the pre-industrial concentration).
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.25
Large and rapid climatic changes affecting the atmospheric and oceanic circulation and temperature, and the hydrological cycle, occurred during the last ice age and during the transition towards the present Holocene period (which began about 10,000 years ago).
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.26
Based on the incomplete evidence available, the projected change of 3 to 7°F (1.5 - 4°C) over the next century would be unprecedented in comparison with the best available records from the last several thousand years.

Over a 40 year period, scientist Charles Keeling measured the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere.

bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.33
This unbroken record of the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere shows how it's gone up, in round numbers, from around 315 parts per million to around 370 parts per million on average today.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0057.34
This data is widely accepted by everyone.

Now, let's acknowledge in this discussion that there has been a large and very well funded campaign established and run by industry interests to denigrate climate change as a 'hoax', or as reflecting the views of 'radicals', or as a set of theories which have 'no consensus' in the science community, or as 'junk science', etc. Each of those claims is a lie, or at the very least, a serious misrepresentation (see data above).
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0058.2
Let's also acknowledge that this campaign is reflected in Bush administration statements and policies (commenting on his own science council conclusions that GW was real, and that human activity was an undoubted causal factor, Bush said "Yes, I'm familiar with what those bureaucrats said.")
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0058.3
We'll note that the Texas Republican Party Platform of 2000 states, "We oppose...
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0058.4
the theory of global warming."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0058.5
And, let's acknowledge that such comments/opinions are forwarded broadly across the right wing media.

Finally, let's acknowledge that the publication of Lomborg's book was followed by Science Journal, Nature Journal, and Scientific American ALL releasing special editions presenting the problems and errors in Lomborg's analyses.

For both of these scientific journals, the most significant science journals published in English, such a special edition on a single contemporary issue, was unprecedented.

Global warming is 'twice as bad as previously thought'
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.2
By Steve Connor, Science Editor · 27 January 2005
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.3
Global warming might be twice as catastrophic as previously thought, flooding settlements on the British coast and turning the interior into an unrecognisable tropical landscape, the world's biggest study of climate change shows.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.4
Researchers from some of Britain's leading universities used computer modelling to predict that under the "worst-case" scenario, London would be under water and winters banished to history as average temperatures in the UK soar up to 20C higher than at present.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.5
Globally, average temperatures could reach 11C greater than today, double the rise predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the international body set up to investigate global warming.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.6
Such high temperatures would melt most of the polar icecaps and mountain glaciers, raising sea levels by more than 20ft.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.7
A report this week in The Independent predicted a 2C temperature rise would lead to irreversible changes in the climate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.8
The new study, in the journal Nature, was done using the spare computing time of 95,000 people from 150 countries who downloaded from the internet the global climate model of the Met Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.9
The program, run as a screensaver, simulated what would happen if carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were double those of the 18th century, before the Industrial Revolution, the situation predicted by the middle of this century.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.10
David Stainforth of Oxford University, the chief scientist of the latest study, said processing the results showed the Earth's climate is far more sensitive to increases in man-made greenhouse gases than previously realised.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.11
The findings indicate a doubling of carbon dioxide from the pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million would increase global average temperatures by between 2C and 11C.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.12
Mr Stainforth said: "An 11C-warmed world would be a dramatically different world...
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.13
There would be large areas at higher latitudes that could be up to 20C warmer than today.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.14
The UK would be at the high end of these changes.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.15
It is possible that even present levels of greenhouse gases maintained for long periods may lead to dangerous climate change...
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.16
When you start to look at these temperatures, I get very worried indeed."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.17
Attempts to control global warming, based on the Kyoto treaty, concentrated on stabilising the emissions of greenhouse gases at 1990 levels, but the scientists warned that this might not be enough.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.18
Mr Stainforth added: "We need to accept that while greenhouse gas levels can increase we need to limit them, level them off then bring them back down again."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.19
Professor Bob Spicer, of the Open University, said average global temperature rises of 11C are unprecedented in the long geological record of the Earth.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.20
"If we go back to the Cretaceous, which is 100 million years ago, the best estimates of the global mean temperature was about 6C higher than present," Professor Spicer said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.21
"So 11C is quite substantial and if this is right we would be going into a realm that we really don't have much evidence for even in the rock [geological] record."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.22
Myles Allen, of Oxford University, said: "The danger zone is not something we're going to reach in the middle of the century; we're in it now."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0064.23
Each of the hottest 15 years on record have been since 1980.

he has stated on a number of occasions that he believes that we can adjust to moderate climate changes, but he believes that once we contaminate our groundwater (which is taking place all the time) we'll have a hard time dealing with it.

STUDY BOLSTERS GREENHOUSE EFFECT THEORY, SOLVES ICE AGE MYSTERY
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.2
COLUMBUS, Ohio - Critics who dismiss the importance of greenhouse gases as a cause of climate change lost one piece of ammunition this week.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.3
In a new study, scientists found further evidence of the role that greenhouse gases have played in Earth's climate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.4
In Thursday's issue of the journal Geology, Ohio State University scientists report that a long-ago ice age occurred 10 million years earlier than once thought.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.5
The new date clears up an inconsistency that has dogged climate change research for years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.6
Of three ice ages that occurred in the last half-billion years, the earliest ice age posed problems for scientists, explained Matthew Saltzman, assistant professor of geological sciences at Ohio State.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.7
Previous studies suggested that this particular ice age happened during a time that should have been very warm, when volcanoes all over the earth's surface were spewing carbon dioxide (CO2) and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.8
With CO2 levels as much as 20 times higher than today, the late Ordovician period (460-440 million years ago) wasn't a good time for growing ice.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.9
Critics have pointed to the inconsistency as a flaw in scientists' theories of climate change.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.10
Scientists have argued that today's global climate change has been caused in part by buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere resulting from fossil fuel emissions.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.11
But, critics have countered, if CO2 truly raises global temperatures, how could an ice age have occurred when a greenhouse effect much greater than today's was in full swing?
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.12
The answer: This particular ice age didn't begin when CO2 was at its peak -- it began 10 million years earlier, when CO2 levels were at a low.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.13
"Our results are consistent with the notion that CO2 concentrations drive climate."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.14
Saltzman and doctoral student Seth Young found that large deposits of quartz sand in Nevada and two sites in Europe -- Norway and Estonia -- formed around the same time, 440 million years ago.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.15
The scientists suspect that the sand formed when water levels fell low enough to expose quartz rock, so that wind and rain could weather the rock into sand.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.16
The fact that the deposits were found in three different sites suggests that sea levels may have been low all over the world at that time, likely because much of the planet's water was bound in ice at the poles, Saltzman said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.17
Next, the scientists examined limestone sediments from the sites and determined that there was a relatively large amount of organic carbon buried in the oceans -- and, by extension, relatively little CO2 in the atmosphere -- at the same time.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.18
Taken together, the evidence suggests that the ice began to build up some 10 million years earlier than when volcanoes began pumping the atmosphere full of the CO2 that ended the Ordovician ice age.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.19
For Saltzman, the find solves a long-standing mystery.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.20
Though scientists know with a great degree of certainty that atmospheric CO2 levels drive climate change, there are certain mismatches in the geologic record, such as the Ordovician ice age -- originally thought to have begun 443 million years ago -- that seem to counter that view.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.21
"How can you have ice when CO2 levels are through the roof?
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.22
That was the dilemma that we were faced with.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.23
I think that now we have good evidence that resolves this mismatch," Saltzman said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.24
Scientists at the three sites previously attributed these quartz deposits to local tectonic shifts.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.25
But the new study shows that the conditions that allowed the quartz sand to form were not local.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.26
"If sea level is dropping globally at the same time, it can't be a local tectonic feature," Saltzman said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.27
"It's got to be the result of a global ice buildup."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0110.28
Saltzman wants to bolster these new results by examining sites in Russia -- where he hopes to find more evidence of sea level drop -- and in parts of South America and North Africa, which would have been covered in ice at the time.

Frankly, with scientists all over the board on this question, it is not surprising that people are concerned and become sceptical when faced with the extraordinary variety of conclusions.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0154.13
All those countries that have signed the Kyoto Protocol must be convinced of something.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0154.14
My concern is that there has been a pattern of denial, often with little scientific support on one side.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0154.15
It has gone something like this:
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0154.16
First, there was an effort to say that no warming existed at all.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0154.17
Then, that there wasn't a significant increase in greenhouse gases.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0154.18
Then, that the warming was natural and that greenhouse gases weren't causing the change, and also that "warmth is better."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0154.19
* · Then, that there was nothing economically that we could do about the greenhouse gases.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0154.20
Also, that agreements to limit greenhouse gases were not fair.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0154.21
Somewhere in there, we start hearing there is no possibility of abrupt climate change.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0154.22
These denials are interspersed with charges that any concern is politically based, full of misinformation and obvious journalistic hysteria.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0154.23
Also, there are hints that these concerns are from scientists who only want to fund their own pet projects.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0154.24
Finally, there are calls from some scientists that they can't get funding for what they consider to be important steps in studying the question.

Global warming: scientists reveal timetable
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.4
By Michael McCarthy, Environment Correspondent · 03 February 2005
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.5
A detailed timetable of the destruction and distress that global warming is likely to cause the world was unveiled yesterday.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.6
It pulls together for the first time the projected impacts on ecosystems and wildlife, food production, water resources and economies across the earth, for given rises in global temperature expected during the next hundred years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.7
The resultant picture gives the most wide-ranging impression yet of the bewildering array of destructive effects that climate change is expected to exert on different regions, from the mountains of Europe and the rainforests of the Amazon to the coral reefs of the tropics.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.8
Produced through a synthesis of a wide range of recent academic studies, it was presented as a paper yesterday to the international conference on climate change being held at the UK Met Office headquarters in Exeter by the author Bill Hare, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Germany's leading global warming research institute.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.9
The conference has been called personally by Tony Blair as part of Britain's attempts to move the climate change issue up the agenda during the current UK presidency of the G8 group of rich nations, and the European Union.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.10
It has already heard disturbing warnings from the latest climate research, including the revelation on Tuesday from the British Antarctic Survey that the massive West Antarctic ice sheet might be disintegrating - an event which, if it happened completely, would raise sea levels around the world by 16ft (4.9 metres).
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.11
Dr Hare's timetable shows the impacts of climate change multiplying rapidly as average global temperature goes up, towards 1C above levels before the industrial revolution, then to 2C, and then 3C.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.12
As present world temperatures are already 0.7C above the pre-industrial level, the process is well under way.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.13
In the near future - the next 25 years - as the temperature climbs to the 1C mark, some specialised ecosystems will start to feel stress, such as the tropical highland forests of Queensland, which contain a large number of Australia's endemic plant species, and the succulent karoo plant region of South Africa.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.14
In some developing countries, food production will start to decline, water shortage problems will worsen and there will be net losses in GDP.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.15
It is when the temperature moves up to 2C above the pre-industrial level, expected in the middle of this century - within the lifetime of many people alive today - that serious effects start to come thick and fast, studies suggest.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.16
Substantial losses of Arctic sea ice will threaten species such as polar bears and walruses, while in tropical regions "bleaching" of coral reefs will become more frequent - when the animals that live in the coral are forced out by high temperatures and the reef may die.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.17
Mediterranean regions will be hit by more forest fires and insect pests, while in regions of the US such as the Rockies, rivers may become too warm for trout and salmon.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.18
In South Africa, the Fynbos, the world's most remarkable floral kingdom which has more than 8,000 endemic wild flowers, will start to lose its species, as will alpine areas from Europe to Australia; the broad-leaved forests of China will start to die.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.19
The numbers at risk from hunger will increase and another billion and a half people will face water shortages, and GDP losses in some developing countries will become significant.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.20
But when the temperature moves up to the 3C level, expected in the early part of the second half of the century, these effects will become critical.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.21
There is likely to be irreversible damage to the Amazon rainforest, leading to its collapse, and the complete destruction of coral reefs is likely to be widespread.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.22
The alpine flora of Europe, Australia and New Zealand will probably disappear completely, with increasing numbers of extinctions of other plant species.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.23
There will be severe losses of China's broadleaved forests, and in South Africa the flora of the Succulent Karoo will be destroyed, and the flora of the Fynbos will be hugely damaged.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.24
There will be a rapid increase in populations exposed to hunger, with up to 5.5 billion people living in regions with large losses in crop production, while another 3 billion people will have increased risk of water shortages.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.25
Above the 3C raised level, which may be after 2070, the effects will be catastrophic: the Arctic sea ice will disappear, and species such as polar bears and walruses may disappear with it, while the main prey species of Arctic carnivores, such as wolves, Arctic foxes and the collared lemming, will have gone from 80 per cent of their range, critically endangering predators.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0156.26
In human terms there is likely to be catastrophe too, with water stress becoming even worse, and whole regions becoming unsuitable for producing food, while there will be substantial impacts on global GDP.

Future climate could be hotter than thought - study · Wed Jun 29, 2005
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.2
By Patricia Reaney
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.3
LONDON (Reuters) - Global temperatures in the future could be much hotter than scientists have predicted if new computer models on climate change are correct, researchers said on Wednesday.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.4
Improvements in air quality will lead to a decrease in aerosols, small particles in the atmosphere that act as a brake on the impact of greenhouse gases.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.5
As the effect of aerosols lessen, searing temperatures could follow.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.6
"This new way of integrating the aerosol, greenhouse gas and biosphere effects changes the picture from one where climate change most likely is a fairly tolerable thing to one where there is a fairly high risk of change sooner, and to a higher degree," said Professor Meinrat Andreae.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.7
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts a rise in global temperatures from a doubling of carbon dioxide could be in the range of 1.5-4.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.8
But according to calculations by Andreae and his team, the upper figure could be as high as 6 degrees.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.9
"That's quite a lot," the professor from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany said in an interview.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.10
Andreae compared greenhouse gases to an accelerator that is speeding up global warming, while the aerosols act as a type of brake.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.11
"The actual true force of the greenhouse gases has been masked by the effects of the aerosols.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.12
They put a brake on warming and we don't really know how strong that brake is," said Andreae, who reported his findings in the journal Nature.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.13
Scientists have warned that severe climate change could lead to a rise in sea levels, flooding, severe droughts and the loss of crop and animals species.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.14
Aerosols are small particles and droplets in the air from combustion processes, chemicals and smoke.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.15
As regulatory agencies issue new air purity controls, the amount of aerosols will diminish so their cooling effect will be smaller.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.16
Aerosols stay in the atmosphere for about a week but greenhouse gases accumulate over about 50 years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.17
The aerosol brake is going to come off faster than the decrease in greenhouse gases.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.18
"Because one is cumulative and the other is not, the cumulative will always win out in the long run," said Andreae.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.19
He admitted it was a situation of high scientific uncertainty.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.20
But if his calculations are correct, climate change in the 21 century could reach the upper extremes or exceed the IPCC estimates.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0259.21
"Such a degree of climate change is so far outside the range covered by experience and scientific understanding that we cannot with any confidence predict the consequences for the Earth system," Andreae said in the journal.

Policies motivated by political gain will inflict public pain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0260.2
Why should anyone applaud?
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0260.3
This could serve as a blanket condemnation of politicians in general, on the whole gamut of "hot button" topics, not just global warming.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0260.4
Politicians are absolutely necessary to the process of implementing and maintaining the social contract.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0260.5
They are not, however, to be trusted when they feel their public image is in the balance.

bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0260.7
The remark about those who "are not hysterical about the global warming panic" was gratuitous and unnecessary--it does nothing to help the debate, and definitely lowers its tone.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0260.8
As for Mr. Samuelson's piece, it is congent in its condemnation of political grandstanding.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0260.9
It is not, however, reliable as scientific review.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0260.10
Although Mr. Samuelson was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1998 as a commentator, there is no reason to assume that his speculations on the topic carry more weight than the opinions of scientists who study the climate for a living.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0261.11
You miss the point of the article entirely which is hypocrisy.......
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0261.12
hypocrisy on the part of the Europeans for their condemnation of the US and the Bush administration for not joining Kyoto Protocol.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0261.13
The following is a quote from Mr. Samuelson's article which draws attention to the hypocrisy:
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0261.14
Europe is the citadel of hypocrisy.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0261.15
Considering Europeans' contempt for the United States and George Bush for not embracing the Kyoto Protocol, you'd expect that they would have made major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions -- the purpose of Kyoto.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0261.16
Well, not exactly.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0261.17
From 1990 (Kyoto's base year for measuring changes) to 2002, global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas, increased 16.4 percent, reports the International Energy Agency.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0261.18
The U.S. increase was 16.7 percent, and most oof Europe hasn't done much better.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0262.1
I didn't miss that point, Rayban, i just didn't focus on it the way you have, since i don't automatically dance with glee at a condemnation of European politicians.

I consider them neither better nor worse than the gobshites in office here.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0350.1
This was discussed by knowledgeable people here on the radio this morning.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0350.2
People who read the latest scientific papers.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0350.3
It is now thought that global warming may affect the intensity of the biggest tropical storms.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0350.4
It is not thought to affect the frequency of the storms.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0350.5
Evidence for both, however, is as yet insufficient.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0350.6
Here's another, unrelated, topic: I noticed that in the last storm aftermath pictures of Biloxi, everything was smashed flat and removed by the wind and water except for a large brick-built church building.

bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0350.8

bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0351.1
hi McT
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0351.2
Yes, storm intensity increase coming as a result of warmer ocean water is the relevant matter it seems.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0351.3
As to the other issue, it might just be cheaper to make all buildings churches then god wouldn't dare.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0352.1
Well I was a bit testy with Walter.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0352.2
Moreover I'll admit to a little impatience with the enduring taste of Brits and other Europeans for the Medieval honorifics with which they lace the enduring hierarchy of their social structures.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0352.3
However, with respect to the hurricanes, I am on firm ground and they are not.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0352.4
There are so many factors that have made meaningful contributions to the recent sad events, and all of them are so vastly more significant than the "probability that global warming contributed to the intensity of the storms", that reaching down into such relatively trivial matters in the midst of this all too real himan disaster, obviously to make a rather spiteful political point, is indeed very offensive - offensive for him to say it; offensive for Walter to post it here; and offensive for Blatham to endorse it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0352.5
First there is the probabilistic factor: there are many super intense hurricanes, but most of them dissipate without a landfall, and most of those that do make a landfall hit unpopulated areas.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0352.6
Second there are the well-known thirty and twelve year cycles in the location, intensity, and frequency of these storms caused by large-scale cyclic shifts in oceanic currents.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0352.7
Third there is the probably unwise wholesale development of the shoreline property on the Gulf Coast, from Twxas to Florida that has occurred over the last thirty years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0352.8
What just a few decades ago was a mostly empty coastline of pristine white beaches, wetlands, tidal backwaters, and southern forrest has become a near continuous city in an amazingly short tiome.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0352.9
Fourth there is the simple fact that we are emerging from a predictable twelve year period of ununsually low hurricane activity, with a particuylarly low incidence of powerful storms into one of equally predictable greater incidence and intensity.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0352.10
(Odd that no one suggested the recent low occurrance of hurricanes was evidence against global warming.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0352.11
Fifth there is the obvious fact that the greatest damage was the result of inept urban planning and land use management by local government in Louisiana over an extended period of time.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0352.12
There are other important factors as well - all vastly more likely and significant in the result than the possibility that global warming has contributed some infinitesmal increment to the power of this storm.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0352.13
To single out this point, while ignoring all the others and them put it in the context of a political dispute, and one with such obvious cultural overtones is hardly the act of a distinguished scientist acting on principle.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0352.14
My point and my distaste for the religious certainty of the slavish followers of contemporary correct poilitical "thought" both stand unaffected.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.2
Dilemma: Increasing CO2 in the atmosphere increases the percentage of the sun's radiation that is deflected by the atmosphere away from Earth's surface; increasing CO2 in the atmosphere increases the percentage of the heat radiated from Earth's surface that is deflected back to Earth's surface.

Why are the polar ice caps on Mars melting?
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.5
Considering CO2 is a greenhouse gas it doesn't REFLECT the sun's radiation back into space.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.6
When you start with something that is so obviously wrong scientifically it punches holes in your entire argument.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.7
You are correct.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.8
I should have written:
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.9
Dilemma: Increasing some emissions in the atmosphere increases the percentage of the sun's radiation that is deflected by the atmosphere away from Earth's surface; increasing CO2 in the atmosphere increases the percentage of the heat radiated from Earth's surface that is deflected back to Earth's surface.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.10
(Both CO2 and those other emissions are emitted by industry, electric power plants, vehicles and other burners of carbon-based fuels.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.11
Decreasing CO2 emissions will probably require decreasing those other emissions as well.)

In global average, increases in greenhouse gas concentrations or in solar radiation bring warmer surface temperatures since they add energy to the climate system.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.16
In contrast, increased industrial and volcanic aerosols restrict the penetration of solar radiation to the Earth's surface and lead to surface cooling.

A drop in the concentration of ozone in the lower stratosphere should also produce a net cooling at the surface.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.18
Changes in albedo that increase the planet's reflectivity will lead to cooling, and those that make it less reflective and more absorbing, to a temperature rise.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.20
The Earth receives most of its direct heat from the visible and near- infrared spectrum of sunlight, retaining about 70 percent of what pours down on its day-lit hemisphere.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.21
The rest is returned, by reflection, back into the cold of space.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.22
A part of what the ground and oceans and lower atmosphere absorb also leaks outward through the atmosphere in the form of infrared radiation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.23
The remaining fraction--trapped in part by greenhouse gases--sustains the habitable environment to which we are accustomed.

Any variation in total radiation from the Sun will force an accompanying change in mean-surface temperature.

As for your Mars argument..
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.27
Like Earth, Mars has seasons that cause its polar caps to wax and wane.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.28
"It's late spring at the south pole of Mars," says planetary scientist Dave Smith of the Goddard Space Flight Center.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.29
"The polar cap is receding because the springtime sun is shining on it."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.30
The reported melting of the polar ice caps on Mars is more than a seasonal melt just as it is on earth now.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0369.31
It is allegedly a general trend throughout all of Mar's seasons.

Blair falls into line with Bush view on global warming
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.3
By Geoffrey Lean and Christopher Silvester
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.4
Published: 25 September 2005
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.5
Tony Blair has admitted that he is changing his views on combating global warming to mirror those of President Bush - and oppose negotiating international treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.6
His admission, which has outraged environmentalists on both sides of the Atlantic, flies in the face of his promises made in the past two years and undermines the agreement he masterminded at this summer's Gleneagles Summit.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.7
And it endangers talks that opened in Ottawa this weekend on a new treaty to combat climate change.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.8
The U-turn will inevitably bring accusations that he has, once again, sold out to Mr Bush, just at the time that the US President is coming under unprecedented pressure to change his policy in the wake of hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.9
Last week the UK Government's chief scientific advisor, Sir David King, said that global warming might have increased their severity.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.10
Over the past two years Mr Blair has consistently claimed global leadership in tackling what he described as "long term, the single most important issue we face as a global community" and has stressed that it "can only properly be addressed through international agreements".
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.11
President Bush repeatedly expressed anger at his position.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.12
Sharing a platform with the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, in New York this month, Mr Blair confessed: "Probably I'm changing my thinking about this", adding that he hoped the world's nations would "not negotiate international treaties".
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.13
This contradicts his assertion in a speech a year ago - which drew a private rebuke from the Bush administration - that "a problem that is global in cause and scope can only be fully addressed through international agreement".
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.14
It also denies what his ministers claimed to be his main achievement on global warming at Gleneagles.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.15
He had succeeded in getting all the leaders except Mr Bush to sign up to negotiating a successor to the Kyoto treaty, and in arranging a meeting between the G8 and leading developing countries to discuss it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.16
But instead of endorsing agreed limits on the pollution that causes climate change, Mr Blair told this month's meeting at the Clinton Global Initiative that he was putting his faith in "developing science and technology" - precisely Mr Bush's position.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.17
He justified his change of heart by saying that countries would not negotiate environmental treaties that cut their growth or consumption - another of the President's main contentions.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.18
But in another speech last April he said it was "quite false" to suppose that environmental protection would inhibit growth.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6566899_0370.19
Last night, Tony Juniper, executive director of Friends of the Earth, called the Prime Minister's volte-face "unbelievable": "Having failed to practise what he preaches, he is now changing his preaching to match his practice."

The prime minister will begin the four-week election battle as a new Guardian/ICM poll puts the parties at their closest in almost two years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.8
Gordon Brown will today take the journey from Downing Street to Buckingham Palace to trigger a 6 May general election to be fought on a Labour manifesto that promises a series of bold initiatives to reform public services in a programme of "national renewal".
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.9
A draft of the manifesto seen by the Guardian pledges that an unprecedented fourth-term Labour government would be "bolder about the role of state intervention in markets" and deliver sweeping constitutional change.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.10
Failing police forces could be taken over by their neighbours under one radical proposal.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.11
Brown's trip to the palace will trigger four weeks of frenetic campaigning and comes as a shock Guardian ICM poll suggests Labour is clawing back support from the Tories.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.12
The poll gives the Conservatives a four-point lead " much smaller than in other recent surveys, reflecting the volatility of the electorate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.13
Brown will meet his cabinet for 45 minutes at 9.15am before driving to the palace to ask the Queen's permission to dissolve parliament.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.14
Previewing the message that will be at the heart of his election campaign, Brown said tonight: "The people of this country have fought too hard to get Britain on the road to recovery to allow anybody to take us back on to the road to recession.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.16
Before launching his "GB on the road campaign", the prime minister will say the choice is between securing the recovery and a reckless Tory party that will derail it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.17
He will insist that the Tories are alone in believing this year is the right time to cut £6bn in government spending.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.18
David Cameron, the Tory leader, will counter by promising to fight for "the great ignored".
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.19
For the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg will say: "The election marks the beginning of the end of Brown.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.21
The draft manifesto, due to be put to a joint cabinet and national executive meeting on Wednesday evening, offers two dominant themes, of renewing the economy and establishing clearer citizens' rights and responsibilities.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.22
It is being stressed that the manifesto will offer progressive solutions for tough times, including reforms of public services that match Tony Blair at his boldest.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.23
New proposals contained in the draft, obtained by the Guardian, include:
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.24
• Provisions for the management of inefficient police forces to be taken over by efficient forces. "
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.25
Where service is not good enough, it will be taken over by the best," the draft says.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.26
• Simultaneous referendums on a new voting system for the Commons and a 100% elected second chamber.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.27
• A national youth service alongside votes at 16.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.28
• Rights for football supporters to take over football clubs.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.29
• A living wage of £7.60 in Whitehall, funded by a cap on the salaries of the most highly paid public sector employees.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0003.30
Cabinet-level discussions are also under way on a range of proposals including a cap on interest charged by credit card companies and a new review of competition law by the Office of Fair Trading.

But the Conservatives, confident they have dealt a significant political blow by promising to cut national insurance contributions next year, believe they can pull off the biggest electoral swing since the 1930s and secure an overall majority.

British prime minister Gordon Brown said he would ensure the country had a "strong, stable" government after an inconclusive election left no party with an outright parliamentary majority.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0051.7
Mr Brown said he had asked the cabinet secretary, Britain's most senior civil servant, to arrange support for all parties that might be involved in talks over a possible future coalition government.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0051.8
"It is my duty as prime minister to take all steps to ensure Britain has a strong, stable and principled government," Mr Brown said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0051.9
"I have asked the cabinet secretary to arrange for the civil service to provide support on request to parties engaged in discussions on the formation of government."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0051.10
With 621 seats out of 650 reported, the Conservatives had 291 seats against Labour's 251.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0051.11
The Tories have picked up 92 seats but the swing is not enough to give them an overall majority.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0051.12
Mr Brown is still the prime minister for now and will need to cobble together a coalition if he is to survive, but that is looking less likely with Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg saying he will talk to the Conservatives first.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0051.13
"I've said that whichever party gets the most votes and the most seats, if not an absolute majority, has the first right to seek to govern, either on its own or by reaching out to other parties," Mr Clegg said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487528_0051.14
"And I stick to that view.

The local election results were not bad enough to force his immediate ejection, as some had feared (and perhaps others had hoped).
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.4
But the last 24 hours have brought two signs that the light over No 10 is fading.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.5
First came a reshuffle that exposed more problems for the government than it solved.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.6
And now the Guardian's revelation of <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour/story/0,,1768888,00.html" title="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour/story/0,,1768888,00.html" target="_EXT">a plot by serious minded and previously loyal MPs</a> - emphatically not the usual suspects - to force Blair into naming the day of his departure.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.7
Perhaps the true loyalists around the prime minister still believe he can serve out a third full term, holding onto office till 2009 or even 2010.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.8
But if they do, they are the only ones.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.9
To most of his party, this feels like the beginning of the end.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.11
He doubtless began the day hoping his reshuffle, the biggest of his career, would soothe the wounds of the night before.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.12
But it didn't.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.13
Charles Clarke refused to accept a consolation prize, preferring a return to the backbenches and, extraordinarily, publicly disputing the PM's judgement.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.14
That must have forced some hurried changes to the game plan.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.15
The result was grumbles all round.

Far from bringing in fresh blood, Blair was forced to recirculate blood that's been in the system a long, long time.

No one embodies that better than John Reid, arch-Blairite henchman now elevated to the Home Office - his sixth cabinet post in five years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.23
Reid gives good Newsnight, but rejuvenating he ain't [..]
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.25
But the objections to this reshuffle went deeper than that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.26
For nothing about it suggested a prime minister preparing the ground for the "orderly transition" which he himself necessitated nearly two years ago, when he announced that he would not seek a fourth term.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.27
More importantly nothing in this reshuffle signalled an eventual handover to Brown at all.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.28
On the contrary, the PM simply dug in, surrounding himself with Blairite ultras.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.29
The promotion of Reid, the retention of Tessa Jowell are part of it; but even more provocative was the appointment of Hazel Blears as party chairman.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.30
If Blair had a transition in mind, he would have picked a neutral for the job; or even someone allied to Brown, say Douglas Alexander, to smooth the way.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.31
He would also have brought on a new generation, giving them precious experience, ready to serve a new administration.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.32
Instead the PM selected a team to help him finish the job, rather than to prepare for the next phase of the Labour government.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.33
What he installed yesterday was a Final Days administration.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.34
The great irony is that the conventional sequence of such a day is for a disastrous poll result to be rescued by a sparkling reshuffle.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.35
Yet yesterday it was almost the other way around: it was the ministerial rejig, rather than the council elections, which drew attention to the fundamental weaknesses of the government.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.36
For on its own, Thursday night was not the disaster it might have been.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.37
Labour could have haemorrhaged 400 seats, rather than 250; its share of the vote could have fallen to less than a quarter, rather than 26%.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.38
In the event, Labour could claim to have held firm, not falling below its 2004 local performance, which was followed by a general election win.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.39
There were even some gains, Lambeth in London and extra seats in Manchester, Sheffield and Barnsley.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.40
But that was not the mood yesterday.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.41
For there was a winner on Thursday and his name is David Cameron.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.42
He took his party to the psychologically important 40% threshold for the first time since 1992.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.43
It's not yet the national surge the Conservatives need: Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle remain stubbornly Tory-free zones.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.44
But gains in London and the south east, in Hammersmith and Croydon, are not to be sneezed at either.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.45
As one anxious Labour strategist put it yesterday: "Seats like those, remember, are the New Labour majority."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0126.46

Short version:
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0130.4
BRITAIN'S sleaze watchdog has attacked Tony Blair for failing to uphold standards in public life after a succession of scandals.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0130.5
Sir Alistair Graham, appointed by the PM to oversee politicians' behaviour, says that Blair "sees standards as a peripheral, minor issue not worthy of serious consideration".
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0130.6
By contrast, Gordon Brown, who met Graham last month, was much more supportive.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0130.7
It emerged this weekend that further arrests may be "imminent" in the investigation into the alleged loans-for-honours scandal.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0130.8
Graham reveals his frustration at Blair's reluctance to adopt his recommendations on improving politicians' behaviour.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0130.9
On cronyism, he says: "We have given recommendations as to how the government could address that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0130.10
They accepted many of our recommendations but they didn't accept those."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0130.11
"We suspect he is pretty lukewarm to the work we do, though it is interesting where we suggested changes to improve ethical standards in local government, [the government] accepted all of those."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0130.12
Graham believes an independent figure should be appointed to study alleged breaches of the ministerial code, which is currently policed by the prime minister.

He did it without a note.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.16
Behind him sat three aides, who spoke not a word to him throughout.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.17
You may think what you like about Mr Blair, and many people do, but I cannot imagine that any other government leader in the world could have turned in such a performance.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.18
Now and again he even did passion, anger, sadness, and jokes.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.19
You just knew that if Mr Williams had said: "This has been fascinating.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.20
Would you care to go on for another two hours?"
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.21
he would have said: "Yes".
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.22
The session started with the usual backchat between him and Gwyneth Dunwoody, who said winsomely that she was not allowed to talk to him because she'd been told she upset him.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.23
"You would stop me, wouldn't you?"
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.24
she asked, coyly.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.25
"That would be a pointless exercise," he muttered.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.26
"I don't see how you can be so cruel to one so young and defenceless," she replied.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.27
Gwyneth being flirtatious is like the dancing hippos in Fantasia; it's there right in front of you, but you still can't believe it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.28
In the past the committee has been unduly deferential.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.29
Not now.

Edward Leigh challenged him over Iraq.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.32
The difference between now and a few years ago was that "if you disagreed with Saddam, you ended up in a mass grave", Mr Blair said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.33
"Oh, come on!"
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.34
said Mr Leigh.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.35
"No, you come on!"
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.36
Mr Blair barked back.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.37
It was like watching Rooney versus Ronaldo.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.38
David Maclean, a former Tory chief whip, got into a row with him about the Home Office.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.39
Mr Maclean had been a home office minister when, Mr Blair said, the asylum system had been "a shambles".
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.40
A Labour MP shouted: "Good luck, David!"
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.41
Perhaps he was going to offer to hold his jacket.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.42
"It was not a shambles!"
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.43
Mr Maclean shouted back.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.44
"Jack Straw never said it was a shambles.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.45
Your new home secretary says it's a shambles, and you blame it on an administration from nine years ago!"
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.46
Mrs Dunwoody unilaterally decided to end the fight and move on.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.47
She is rarely gainsaid.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.48
"We were enjoying ourselves," said Mr Blair, a boy brought in from playing football because it's bedtime.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.49
"Yes, I rather thought you were, and that was one of my reasons," Mrs Dunwoody said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.50
Mr Blair grinned, but he also quailed.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.51
It was like one of those gangsters who order a hit, then quiver when their mother speaks crisply to them.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.52
At one point he was asked whether he actually cared what his cabinet thought about anything.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.53
"It would be odd if the prime minister didn't have a firm view on what's the right thing to do," he said, which I read to mean "No".
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.54
And this man is about to quit?
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0138.55
Not yet, I'd guess, and not for some time.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0139.1
That, however, of course was yesterday.

Meanwhile, the Chief Labour fundraiser was arrested in the investigations into the cash-for-peerages scandal.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0139.3
Lord Levy is a close friend and ally of Blair's, and Labour's fund-raising activities were co-ordinated by the PM's inner circle.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0139.4
Even Labour's own treasurer is said to not have been informed of what Levy had been up to.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0139.5
It is "inconceivable" that he could have acted without Blair's knowledge and consent, said SNP leader Alex Salmond.

The chief fundraiser for the British Labour Party has been arrested by police probing allegations state awards had been given in return for cash, according to media reports.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0139.11
Labour came under pressure after it said it had received nearly 14 million pounds of loans from 12 businessmen, some of whom were nominated for seats in the House of Lords afterwards.

All of which leads Hoggart to ponder in The Guardian:
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0139.16
How weird it must be to wake up every morning and be Gordon Brown.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0139.17
In those half-asleep moments he must check for aches and pains, judge the state of his bladder, and ask himself whether he is prime minister yet.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0139.18
Then a spasm of annoyance as he realises that it was all a dream; the shouts and yells next door are from the breakfasting children of the man who is still prime minister!
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0139.19
At that time, dreams, nightmares and reality merge together.

When he came to consciousness yesterday he must have dared to think that the prize for which he has waited so long is about to fall.

There may or may not be "powerful, deeply right wing forces in this country, deep within the establishment and media, who would do anything to try and bring the Labour government down."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0141.12
If these forces are so powerful why have Labour now won 3 elections in a row?
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0141.13
No, the truth is New Labour has dug its own grave (and those of quite a few Iraqis incidentally).

Today, after meeting George Bush to discuss the Middle East, Tony Blair comes to California, the first visit by a serving British prime minister to this fool's paradise.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0143.6
Blair will meet Californian aristocrats such as the Schultz family [..]
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0143.7
and meet kingmakers like his old friend Rupert Murdoch [..]
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0143.9

And who knows, Tony may even hit the surf.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0143.11
But why California?
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0143.12
"The reason," the No 10 website helpfully explained, "is that there is a crisis in the Middle East and the prime minister wants to get as far away from it as possible."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0143.13
Actually, it didn't say that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0143.14
Instead, it explained that California "is the sixth or seventh-largest economy in the world...
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0143.15
which is similar to ours in that it is a new economy increasingly based on heavy knowledge-based industries".

Bookies today slashed the odds on Tony Blair to have left his job by the end of this month's Labour party conference from 16/1 to 7/1.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.2
As speculation about Mr Blair's future increased following the resignation of seven members of the government, bookmakers faced a surge in bets on who would take over from him.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.3
"The odds are rapidly being overtaken by events, and we are having to react accordingly," the Ladbrokes spokesman, Robin Hutchison, said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.4
"It's the only show in town as far as the punters are concerned.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.5
We went up with 16/1 and they bit our hands off, and we've been forced to go 7/1.

Ladbrokes have cut the odds on John Prescott becoming the next prime minister from 100/1 to 25/1 following a rush of bets.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.10
Mr Hutchison stressed that bets were for the next permanent Labour leader, and that Ladbrokes would not pay out on Mr Prescott if he was just "an interim seat warmer".
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.11
William Hill have cut the odds on the prime minister leaving this year from 5/1 to 9/4.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.12
Despite today's press suggestions that Mr Blair will go in May, the odds on him leaving next year have lengthened during the day from 1/7 to 1/3 favourite.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.13
William Hill are offering 16/1 that Mr Blair stands down in 2008, 40/1 in 2009 and 66/1 in 2010 or later.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.14
The prime minister is also 14/1 to stay on long enough to beat Margaret Thatcher's 11-year spell.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.15
The chancellor, Gordon Brown is still the 1/5 favourite with William Hill to succeed Mr Blair as Labour leader.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.16
Hill's are also offering 7/1 for the home secretary, John Reid, 8/1 for Alan Johnson, the education secretary and 10/1 for David Miliband, the environment secretary.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.17
The international development secretary, Hilary Benn, the former health secretary Alan Milburn, and the leader of the Commons, Jack Straw, are all at 25/1.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.18
The foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, is at 40/1, while the defence secretary, Des Browne, and the Welsh and Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Hain are 50/1.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.19
The former home secretary Charles Clarke is the outsider at 66/1.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0156.20
Ladbrokes said the Conservatives have been cut from 4/6 to 4/7 to win the next general election, with Labour now 5/4 from 11/10 - the highest odds against a Labour win since 1995.

bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0163.3
Splits, resignations, media frenzy, calls for a new leader.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0163.4
It all sounds incredibly familiar to someone who has worked for John Major and William Hague.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0163.5
So I thought my Blairite friends in Downing Street and elsewhere might enjoy the benefit of my experience:
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0163.6
1. You will be tempted to call for unity.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0163.7
Calls for unity never work.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0163.8
2. You are quite right, you are surrounded by nutters.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0163.9
But the funny thing about nutters is that they don't appreciate being called mad.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0163.10
Don't bother, therefore, attacking your internal opponents.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0163.11
3. You were quite wrong.

6. Nothing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0163.19
The only card the Prime Minister still has is incumbency.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0163.20

A number of MPs and junior ministers have signed a letter calling for Blair to go now, but Blair has not sacked them.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0164.2
Now one of them Tom Watson, has "resigned".
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0164.3
Hmm, hmm..

the quotation marks around the "resigned" are correct..
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0164.5
In his own resignation letter, Watson explains how it happened:
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0164.6
As you know, I had a conversation with the chief whip last night, in which she asked me to withdraw my support from the 2001 intake's letter calling on you to stand down, or my position would be untenable as a government minister.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0164.7
I have reflected on this overnight.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0164.8

"We have revolutionised the lives and expectations of millions of our citizens, combining social justice with prosperity in a way which is unprecedented in the history of our country"

bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0164.19
Yet when addressing the PM he is surprisingly straightforward:
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0164.20
So it is with the greatest sadness that I have to say that I no longer believe that your remaining in office is in the interest of either the party or the country.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0164.21
How and why this situation has arisen no longer matters.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0164.22
I share the view of the overwhelming majority of the party and the country that the only way the party and the government can renew itself in office is urgently to renew its leadership.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0164.23
His letter, moreover, refrains from most any dig, which speaks for Watson though it reduces its entertainment value.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0164.24
There's just the one, which obliquely but snidely refers to Blair's well-known obsession with his (personal) "legacy":

bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.13
Gordon Brown's long-held dream of taking over as Prime Minister received a significant blow this weekend after it was revealed that up to 10 cabinet ministers are discussing backing an 'anyone but Gordon' candidate and that Tony Blair will not give the Chancellor a personal endorsement.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.14
Senior government figures are threatening to make the contest a bitter referendum on Brown's personal integrity after last week's vicious bout of infighting.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.15
They spent Friday discussing their choice of candidate and the mechanics of a bid after concluding they could no longer support him.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.16
This follows a serious breakdown between the two rival camps, culminating, according to one very close confidant of Tony Blair, in the Prime Minister telling friends: 'I have never known how mendacious he [Gordon] was, how full of mendacity.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.18
Cabinet ministers spoke to The Observer before Blair's warning yesterday to both sides to suspend their damaging personal attacks [..]
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.20
The Prime Minister also condemned the 'irredeemably old-fashioned' politics of MPs plotting against him and called for openness in debating Labour's future.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.21
This was seen as a signal that discussion will not be repressed by what Charles Clarke called Brown's 'control freak' instincts.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.23
The cabinet source said while they had not chosen a rival candidate yet, the last week had tipped the balance to someone of 'credibility and stature' standing against Brown.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.24
Alan Johnson, Alan Milburn, John Reid and Charles Clarke are potential names.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.25
'Until the beginning of this week, most of us would have ended up supporting him [Brown] because there wasn't anyone else,' said a source involved in the discussions.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.26
'Now almost for sure, because of his behaviour, there will be a serious challenge from someone within cabinet and he's only got himself to blame.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.28
Asked how many of the cabinet would back such a candidate, the minister said: 'Now, I think half a dozen, but I think it could be more like 10 [when a candidate is picked].

bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.32
' Brown's behaviour showed he lacked the 'honesty, integrity and trustworthiness' required, the source added.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.34
The Prime Minister is not now expected to publicly bless Brown's candidacy, and a senior minister said even a repeat of previous glowing testimonials were now out: 'He will describe him as having made an immense contribution, because he has, but I'm afraid that events of this week have changed things fundamentally and for ever.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.36
Brown's allies will, however, be reassured by an Ipsos/MORI poll for The Observer which found voters rated him more trustworthy, having better judgment and as more down-to-earth than most politicians, including Blair.

If there are further public attacks on Brown, [moreover,] a delegation of Labour MPs is said to be prepared to go to Downing Street this week to demand that Blair quit.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0223.42
Downing Street sources stressed Blair had phoned ministers and friends yesterday to demand self-restraint.

Brown or Blair - to some extent, they stand for the same shit.

And thus they both now have the unions to deal with: those are sounding angry, and what is more, they are making sense.

Union leaders were incandescent yesterday at the damage done to Labour by the squabbling over Mr Blair's departure date and who might succeed him.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0253.13
Their anger was made worse by Mr Brown's statement [..]
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0253.14
that he planned to "intensify" his privatisation of public services.

[Brendan Barber, the TUC general secretary,] reflected opinions by other union leaders who are rapidly cooling towards the prospect of Mr Brown becoming prime minister.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0253.18
Mark Serwotka, general secretary of PCS, said he could not see the benefit for the five million public sector workers of a Brown premiership that included more privatisation and lower pay.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0253.19
Mr Prentis also warned of a national strike over the privatisation of NHS services - another policy backed by the chancellor.

He said: "The NHS is under threat in a very insidious way from within the very party that created it. "

Brendan Barber used his keynote address on the first day of the four-day Trade Union Congress conference in Brighton to urge the government to get its act together, and give voters a new sense of purpose by ending the " leadership soap opera" and focusing on policies.

, such as a strong economy and better public services [..]
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0253.32
"But what pains me are the self-inflicted wounds," he said, pointing to the "autopilot foreign policy" that tied Britain to the United States, the 1m jobs lost in manufacturing since 1997, and a "disturbing faith" in flexible Labour markets, which gave British workers the weakest employment protections in Europe.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0253.34
[He cited] the crude approach to tackling financial difficulties by NHS trusts, the constant calls for reforms which gave the false impression the NHS is in crisis, and the ideological preference for private solutions.

Unions bared their teeth today over the government's NHS reforms as the conference unanimously backed a motion calling on the TUC to support any public sector union taking strike action over controversial service reforms.

Gordon Brown today laid out his credentials to be the next Labour leader and prime minister, telling the Labour party conference: "I know where I come from, what I believe and what I can contribute."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0264.4
Mr Brown made a public admission of his "regret" over the "differences" between himself and Tony Blair, saying "where over these years, differences have distracted from what matters I regret that, as I know Tony does too".
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0264.6
He told the conference he offered: "New Labour renewed, not just holding the centre ground, but modernising it in a progressive way too."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0264.7
His 37-minute speech was received with an ovation lasting two minutes and 45 seconds.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0264.8
The PM, who sat on stage alongside the chancellor, has so far pointedly refused to endorse any candidate as his successor.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0264.10
Mr Brown immediately stressed he would, if leader, want to "draw on all the talents of our party and country" - hinting he may offer cabinet jobs to personal rivals.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0264.11
He also talked about his upbringing in a Scottish rectory "surrounded by books, sports, music and encouragement", opportunities denied to some of his friends.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0264.13
His speech ranged across the Middle East, global poverty, terror, education, the environment, citizenship, parliament, as well as his own childhood and his praise for Mr Blair.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0264.14
As billed in advance, he suggested forming an independent executive to run areas like the NHS, in the manner in which he made the Bank of England independent.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0264.16
He suggested that decisions over peace and war should be matters for parliament, as well as making patronage over appointments arm's-length from government in the wake of the cash-for-honours saga.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0264.17
And, while the police investigation into claims that Labour lenders were offered honours continues, Mr Brown said he thought home helps and carers "should be the first call for our honours system".
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0264.19
On policy, he announced that the Treasury would be publishing a far-reaching study of the interaction of economics and climate change in the next few days.

bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0266.36
The young man looked evasive.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0266.37
Well, if someone specifically asked for something, staff could write it on a bit of paper at the manager's office.

The prime minister steered clear of the things that have gone wrong with his government, though these include episodes so significant that they will determine how he is seen by history.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0277.7
An undercurrent of evasiveness has run through his premiership and it was evident again yesterday when he asserted "terrorism isn't our fault.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0277.8
We didn't cause it".

That slippery claim is not entirely true of Iraq and he would have strengthened his case had he shown a little humility.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0277.10
He also talked of a country that was "aching for change" in 1997 but did not admit that, from honours to the environment, his government's record has not always matched those hopes.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0277.11
His belated conversion to the benefits of regulation (green restrictions on business, on the advertising of junk food) was notable, as was his confusion over whether this was "old" or "new" labour.

He could have delivered chunks at any time in the past 12 years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0277.19

On education, reforming the NHS, identity cards and even Iraq he read them a crisp and businesslike lecture.

There were the usual verb-free sentences - 79 in all - which in the past implied commitments without making promises.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0277.22
Now they evoke achievements that may or may not have occurred: "The end of waiting in the NHS. Historic.

Mr Prescott's remarks last night infuriated many Blairites who increasingly fear that their stock is falling.

One pessimistic ally of the prime minister admitted that he was doubtful any Blairite candidate would be able to gather the necessary number of nominations to stand.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0284.5
The names of all nominees have to be published, and some Brownites suggested that a Blairite candidate was as many as 10 short of the 43 MPs required to mount a candidature.

Mr Prescott is the second cabinet minister to depart from the agreement reached at last week's cabinet meeting not to make announcements on the leadership at the conference.

The foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, also endorsed Mr Brown this week.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0284.9
The only lingering hope for Blairites is that the party will sense that the chancellor is not electable, and over the next few months start to shift to another candidate.

bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0299.7

Gordon Brown is failing to persuade the public that he would make a better prime minister than David Cameron, according to a Guardian/ICM poll published today which suggests the Conservatives could win a working majority at the next general election.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.4
Voters give the Tories a clear 13-point lead when asked which party they would back in a likely contest between Mr Brown, Mr Cameron and Sir Menzies Campbell.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.5
The result would give the party 42% of the vote against Labour on 29%, similar to its performance under Michael Foot in 1983.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.6
The Liberal Democrats would drop to 17%.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.7
The result is the highest that the Conservatives have scored in any ICM poll since July 1992, just after their last general election victory.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.8
The question, which names all three major party leaders, asks voters to think about politics in a different way from the standard ICM question about voting intentions, which only names parties.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.9
As such, it is a greater test of the personality of each party leader, or potential leader.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.11
A month ago, the same question put Conservative support on 39%, Labour on 31% and the Liberal Democrats on 19%.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.12
There is already concern among some Labour MPs about the impact of a Brown leadership, especially if it happens without a contest that could allow Mr Brown to set out a fresh programme and identity.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.13
Writing in the Guardian last week, the former minister Frank Field asked: "What new directions can be offered when the architect of current policies has merely moved up one place?"
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.15
The findings underline the difficulty facing Mr Brown as he waits for the prime minister, Tony Blair, to announce his departure from office.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.16
He needs to stay loyal to Mr Blair and has been limited in what he can say about policy areas that are beyond his Treasury brief.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.17
But the silence has given opponents such as Mr Cameron, as well as Labour MPs running for the deputy leadership, a clear run to make their mark.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.18
It is widely expected that Mr Brown's likely arrival in office will give Labour a bounce in the polls, not least because attention will shift on to the government.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.19
Mr Brown has already mapped out an agenda for his first months in office.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.20
But he cannot break with significant policies he endorsed as chancellor, such as the Iraq war.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.21
The risk is that expectations of a dramatic plan for his first 100 days are running well ahead of what it is actually possible to offer.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.22
Much will depend on what he can announce in the budget later this spring, and the comprehensive spending review that will follow in the summer.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.24
In the regular state-of-the-parties survey, the Conservatives rise three points on last month to 40%, Labour are unchanged on 31% and the Lib Dems drop 4 points to 19%.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.25
Since the question naming likely leaders is worded differently from the regular ICM survey of voting intention, direct comparisons can be misleading.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.26
But the mention of Mr Brown's name appears to reduce Labour support by 2 points.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.27
Falling Lib Dem support is part of the reason that the Conservatives have climbed in both sets of results.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.28
The fact that the party's support drops further when Sir Menzies' name is mentioned suggests that, as with Mr Brown, he is not attracting support to his party.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.29
The poll also shows voters remain interested in smaller parties, which climb one point overall to 10% and reach 12% in the question naming likely party leaders.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.30
But there is no evidence that the UK Independence party is eroding Conservative support from the right.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.31
The newly-rebranded Independence party scores 1%, against 2% for the Green party and 4% for the combined SNP and Plaid Cymru vote in Scotland and Wales.

Poll findings cannot be translated easily into seats at Westminster [..]
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.34
But two informal calculators, the UK Polling Report and Electoral Calculus, estimate that with Mr Brown in charge voters might give the Conservatives a lead that could give them a majority of more than 50.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0309.35
The standard state-of-the-parties figures suggest that the Conservatives could hope to become the largest party at Westminster, but short of a majority.

Tony Blair has admitted for the first time that he regrets the way his lengthy departure has created 'uncertainty' for a government now racked by a divisive battle over who will succeed him.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0312.3
In a wide-ranging interview with Mary Riddell in today's Observer, the Prime Minister spoke frankly of his doubts over whether he had done the right thing by pre-announcing that he would not fight a fourth election.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0312.4
But he suggested the upheaval could have been worse if he had not been open about his intentions, and said he hoped his departure would finally draw the sting over the war in Iraq.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0312.5
Blair also quashed speculation about a snap election to give Gordon Brown a mandate as leader, suggesting it would be a 'significant time' before Britain next goes to the polls.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0313.1

he could nto have said I go on and on a la Thatcher
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0313.3
so he says he will not stand for a fourth term, perfectly reasonable, except for the last 6 months at least, Blair has lost his authority.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0313.4
He should have point blank refused to engage in standing down speculation imo.

Tony Blair, the former UK prime minister, is re-emerging as a possible choice to be the European Union�s first full-time president after four momentous crises reinforced the argument for having a high-profile international personality in the job.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0404.3
According to EU officials and diplomats, the impressive performance of Nicolas Sarkozy, France�s president, during his six-month spell in charge of the EU last year has strengthened the hand of those who say a big name should guide the 27-nation bloc.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0404.4
In one sense, the discussions are premature.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0404.5
The full-time president will take office next year only if the EU�s Lisbon institutional reform treaty, which creates the position, is ratified by all member-states " notably, Ireland, which is expected to hold a second referendum on the treaty between September and December.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0404.6
But the sheer scale of the challenges facing the EU " from last August�s Russia-Georgia war and the global financial meltdown to the Gaza conflict and the shutdown of Russian gas deliveries to Europe " is redefining the debate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0404.7
Whereas last year Germany and other countries looked favourably on candidates such as Jean-Claude Juncker, the long-serving prime minister of Luxembourg, more policymakers now feel the EU presidency demands an occupant from a much bigger member-state.

At present the EU presidency " held since January 1 by the Czech Republic " rotates every six months.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0404.12
Mr Blair�s name has often cropped up in connection with the job, but last year several factors worked against him, such as his close partnership with George W. Bush, the outgoing US president, and his perceived talent for publicly supporting the EU without being bold enough to commit the UK to closer involvement, for example, by adopting the euro.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0404.13
EU diplomats said these reservations still applied but had diminished over time and with the recognition that Mr Blair was one of Europe’s few genuine stars on the world stage.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0404.14
In what looked like a �rehabilitation� of Mr Blair�s standing in the Franco-German core of the EU, the former premier shared the spotlight last Thursday with Mr Sarkozy and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, at a Paris conference on the future of capitalism.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0404.15
Mr Blair�s chances of getting the job " should it ever be created " may improve as a result of an impending re-distribution of powerful jobs among European leaders.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193409-6487537_0404.16
Under one scenario, Jos� Manuel Barroso of Portugal would keep his job as European Commission president, and the post of EU foreign policy chief would go to Jaap de Hoop Scheffer of the Netherlands, currently Nato�s secretary-general.

The Nato job would go to Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Denmark�s prime minister, and the European parliament presidency would be shared between Martin Schulz of Germany and Jerzy Buzek of Poland.

No matter how hard President Obama tries to turn the page on the previous administration, he can’t.

Until there is true transparency and true accountability, revelations of that unresolved eight-year nightmare will keep raining down drip by drip, disrupting the new administration’s high ambitions.

Both Dick Cheney, hoping to prove that torture “worked,” and Nancy Pelosi, fending off accusations of hypocrisy on torture, have now asked for classified C.I.A. documents to be made public.

Well, if it is not a reinstitution of properly constituted tribunals, with due process etc I would agree with Thomas.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0083.3
But I am not sure why people are making the assumption that what Obama proposes is pretty much the same as the Bush things.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0083.4
What do you mean by the "re" in "reinstitution"?
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0083.5
There never have been any properly constituted tribunals to deal with alleged terrorist caught in the ill-defined battlefield in the vaguely defined war on terror.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0083.6
These tribunals were coughed up on the fly, after the alleged offenders were caught and locked up.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0083.7
Their rules were made up as the process went along, depending on what was politically convenient at the time, and what the courts would let the government get away with.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0083.8
This is screwed up, and this alone dooms the military tribunals to be kangaroo courts.

<a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/" title="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/" target="_EXT">GLENN GREENWALD: Facts and myths about Obama's preventive detention proposal</a>
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.2
Excerpt:
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.4
(1) What does "preventive detention" allow ?
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.5
It's important to be clear about what "preventive detention" authorizes.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.6
It does not merely allow the U.S. Government to imprison people alleged to have committed Terrorist acts yet who are unable to be convicted in a civilian court proceeding.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.7
That class is merely a subset, perhaps a small subset, of who the Government can detain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.8
Far more significant, "preventive detention" allows indefinite imprisonment not based on proven crimes or past violations of law, but of those deemed generally "dangerous" by the Government for various reasons (such as, as Obama put it yesterday, they "expressed their allegiance to Osama bin Laden" or "otherwise made it clear that they want to kill Americans").
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.9
That's what "preventive" means: imprisoning people because the Government claims they are likely to engage in violent acts in the future because they are alleged to be "combatants."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.10
Once known, the details of the proposal could -- and likely will -- make this even more extreme by extending the "preventive detention" power beyond a handful of Guantanamo detainees to anyone, anywhere in the world, alleged to be a "combatant."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.11
After all, once you accept the rationale on which this proposal is based -- namely, that the U.S. Government must, in order to keep us safe, preventively detain "dangerous" people even when they can't prove they violated any laws -- there's no coherent reason whatsoever to limit that power to people already at Guantanamo, as opposed to indefinitely imprisoning with no trials all allegedly "dangerous" combatants, whether located in Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia, Western countries and even the U.S.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.13
(6) Is it "due process" when the Government can guarantee it always wins ?
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.14
If you really think about the argument Obama made yesterday -- when he described the five categories of detainees and the procedures to which each will be subjected -- it becomes manifest just how profound a violation of Western conceptions of justice this is.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.15
What Obama is saying is this: we'll give real trials only to those detainees we know in advance we will convict.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.16
For those we don't think we can convict in a real court, we'll get convictions in the military commissions I'm creating.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.17
For those we can't convict even in my military commissions, we'll just imprison them anyway with no charges ("preventively detain" them).
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.18
Giving trials to people only when you know for sure, in advance, that you'll get convictions is not due process.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.19
Those are called "show trials."
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.20
In a healthy system of justice, the Government gives everyone it wants to imprison a trial and then imprisons only those whom it can convict.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.21
The process is constant (trials), and the outcome varies (convictions or acquittals).
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.22
Obama is saying the opposite: in his scheme, it is the outcome that is constant (everyone ends up imprisoned), while the process varies and is determined by the Government (trials for some; military commissions for others; indefinite detention for the rest).
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.23
The Government picks and chooses which process you get in order to ensure that it always wins.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0102.24
A more warped "system of justice" is hard to imagine.

ORDER DENYING IN PART AND GRANTING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0108.4
Filed 6/12/09
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0108.5
Excerpts:
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0108.6
* * * Like any other government official, government lawyers are responsible for the foreseeable consequences of their conduct....
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0108.7
* * * the Court finds Padilla has alleged sufficient facts to satisfy the requirement that Yoo set in motion a series of events that resulted in the deprivation of Padilla’s constitutional rights....
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0108.8
Padilla alleges with specificity that Yoo was involved in the decision to detain him and created a legal construct designed to justify the use of interrogation methods that Padilla alleges were unlawful.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0108.9
* * * The allegation that Padilla was denied any access to counsel for nearly two years is sufficient to state a claim for violation of his right to access to courts....
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0108.10
* * *Padilla alleges that Yoo bears responsibility for the conditions of his confinement due to his drafting opinions that purported to create legal legitimacy for such treatment.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0108.11
Therefore, although Padilla’s claim must be analyzed under the Due Process provision of the Fourteenth Amendment and not pursuant to the Eighth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment sets the bar below which the treatment of detainees should not fall.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0108.12
* * * · Once the Court finds that the facts would show the violation of a constitutional right, the next inquiry is to determine “whether the right was clearly established.

” Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0108.14
Yoo argues that because no federal court has afforded an enemy combatant the kind of constitutional protections Padilla seeks in this case, there was no violation of Padilla’s clearly established constitutional rights.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0108.15

bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.2
Last week, President Obama’s Justice Department filed a legal brief against same sex marriage in which it compared gay unions to incestuous ones and that of an underage girl " in the sense that states have the right to not recognize marriages that are legal in other states or countries.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.3
The timing of the brief, which the president of the leading gay and lesbian rights organization said caused his community “pain,” is awkward, given that next Thursday, June 25, the Democratic National Committee is hitting up the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community for cash in a fundraiser featuring Vice President Biden.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.4
As John Aravosis at AmericaBlog reports, gay donors, outraged at the legal brief, are withdrawing their support from the event.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.5
The treasurer of the DNC, Andrew Tobias, finds himself distancing himself from the brief, as Ben Smith of Politico reports.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.7
If this debacle of a brief represented the president's views, I'd boycott too," Tobias said in an e-mail.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.8
But Tobias insisted that he “personally totally believe(s) in the president.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.10
David Mixner, a former adviser to President Clinton, is not so sold, writing that the brief is a “sickening document” that “could have been written by the Rev. Pat Robertson.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.11
Using the worst of stereotypes, it intimates that we don't have constitutional guarantees, invokes scenarios of incest, of children and advocates that we don't have the same rights as others who have struggled for civil rights.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.13
Mixner says many scholars don’t think the Obama administration needed to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, which states that states don’t have to accept same sex marriages from other states.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.14
Some disagree.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.15
But “to a person, they say that the response is way out of line, totally unnecessary and goes far beyond anything required.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.16
They all agree that if the Department of Justice felt they had to respond, a simple, few-paged brief on the very limited issue before the Federal Court would have been all that was necessary.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.18
The brief, Mixner argues, “undercuts every conceivable argument that the LGBT community would use to fight for the repeal of DOMA.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.19
Right-wing nut cases can now just simply quote horrible stuff from this hateful brief and proclaim loudly it was filed by the Obama Justice Department.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.21
For that reason, Mixner withdrew his support from the DNC fundraiser.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.22
As did big Democratic gay donors Andy Towle and Alan Van Capelle, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda and Foundation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.23
Aravosis is mad, criticizing "this rather ill-timed and inappropriate Democratic effort to milk money from our community at the same time Democrats are equating us with incest and not lifting a finger on any of our legislation priorities in Congress or the White House.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193488-6644828_0111.24
It's not awfully clear why any gay person would give a Democrat a dime ever again.

bolt-eng-DF-199-193571-6490934_0029.3
To the contrary they are allowing the public to believe that fear is not something to be considered by not correcting the historical incidents and indeed adding to this picture themselves.

I was in a bank some years ago to get a loan and the bank officer struck up a conversation with me and somehow the question of ethics arose.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193571-6490934_0030.15
He kind of looked at me as if I was a simpleton and said something that expressed the notion that business and ethics were not bed partners.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193571-6490934_0030.16
I asked him "you want me to pay off the loan without you having to take me to court to get your money out of me".
bolt-eng-DF-199-193571-6490934_0030.17
"You're going to pay off the loan aren't you?"
bolt-eng-DF-199-193571-6490934_0030.18
he said nervously.
bolt-eng-DF-199-193571-6490934_0030.19
So I said to him see you do expect me to behave ethically towards you so why can't you see that ethics and business are partners and only when they are no longer partners does the system fail!

Well yes you did provide me a link to Amazon.com and an excerpt from the book, but to discern whether your argument has a rational basis I need to buy and read the book.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.7
Fair enough, but I doubt too many A2K members are about to go such a length to continue a debate, and even if they all are, I'm not.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.8
Do you deny that I could pretty easily find a book on Amazon that supports my argument?
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.9
This would certainly not prove my argument any more than a single source proves yours, but it would put an identical burden on you.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.10
Your source may be 100% correct, but it advances a highly controversial premise that few people will find consistent with what have learned over the years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.11
Again, this certainly doesn't mean the source is full of shit, but it does make reliance upon it a dodgy prospect for what should be other than a strictly academic premise for A2K debate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.12
It's certainly OK for you to insist that your position is supported by your source, and requires me to refute it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.13
I'm not going to make the effort though and so our discussion could end here.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.14
Mutual adult consent in an incestuous relationship is highly suspect.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.15
Couples don't have to prove to anyone that their sexual relations are mutually consensual.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.16
The burden of proof rests on those who would criminalize them.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.17
And the mere fact that a relationship is suspect to you doesn't rise to any standard of evidence.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.18
Not really.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.19
Incest is illegal in most countries and the various states are not required to prove anything other than the individuals are blood relatives.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.20
This may not comport with what you would prefer, but it is nevertheless reality.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.21
Since incest is almost universally criminalized, our discussion is academic.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.22
You argue that incestuous couples should not have to prove the validity of their consent.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.23
Should adults and children who engage in sexual acts need to prove the validity of their alleged consent, or should that be left to the State?
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.24
A fair response might be that children, by law, are incapable of informed consent, but if you choose to adopt it, I would be interested in how you distinguish it from an argument that children (of any age) are not capable of informed consent concerning sex with their parents.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.25
Where is the bright line dividing the two arguments?
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.26
Mere chronological age?
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.27
I wonder if you are suggesting that no one other than depraved miscreants will ever argue that "children" can form informed consent concerning sex with an adult.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.28
There's probably no grey area concerning children who have not reached puberty, but some children are biologically capable of sexual reproduction as young as 11 years of age.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.29
Are you comfortable with the notion that sex between an adult and a 15 year old is illegal?
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.30
How about children who are 16, 14, or 13?
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.31
If incest doesn't present a genetic problem for humans than the necessity of bio-diversity is overplayed by its proponents.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.32
This argument is invalid.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.33
Promoting biodiversity is about the stability of ecosystems, and about preserving our biological heritage.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.34
Prohibiting incest is about preventing hereditary diseases, and about protecting the weak against pressure to have sex with their elders.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.35
The two issues have nothing to do with one another.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.36
No, the promotion of bio-diversity is predicated upon the value of genetic diversity.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.37
Incest works against genetic diversity.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.38
I suppose some people value bio-diversity because they (like me) have a sentimental attachment to tigers, but they are misappropriating a scientific concept.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0183.39
Interestingly enough you are absolutely on point with at least two of the reasons why incest is taboo, and yet you would sublimate these societal interests to the simple profession of consent between incestuous partners.

@Finn dAbuzz,
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0184.4
A book containing peer-reviewed scientific articles, from a publisher of similar reputation as the University of California Press?
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0184.5
Yes, I deny that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0184.6
I'd love to see you try, though.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0184.8
The same could have been said about slavery only 300 years ago.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0184.9
The abolition of an injustice has to start somewhere
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0184.12
Children are legally incapable of giving consent, so all sex with children is non-consensual by definition.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0184.13
This is incomparable with competent grownups, who can give consent to sex and marriage to anyone they want.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0184.14
I think if they consent to sex and marriage with close relatives, the state should let them.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0184.15
I would be interested in how you distinguish it from an argument that children (of any age) are not capable of informed consent concerning sex with their parents.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0184.18
Yes, mere chronological age.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0184.19
No adult can sleep with anyone below the age of consent, including close relatives.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0184.20
Every adult can sleep with anyone above the age of consent.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0184.21
I think that should include close relatives.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194088-6770261_0184.22
This is a really easy rule.

Going through my budget the other day (there is a lot less money in the budget now, obviously.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.6
I was fretting over whether I needed to quit my gym membership.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.7
It's about a hundred a month and there is a locker rental of $150 every six months.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.8
Not a lot, but there are other things I could use the money for.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.9
(Attorney fees, for example.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.10
Once I stopped whining, I started asking myself why I have the gym membership.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.11
I have it because I run in the morning and I need a place to shower and change before work.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.12
(I have a whole routine of TH-take home laundry--SA-Take fresh clothes to gym.) Okay.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.13
So what would have to change in order for you not to need the gym?
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.14
Um.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.15
Run after work.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.16
Shower at home.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.17
Duh.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.18
I can carry (or wear) my running stuff and my lunch (another money saver) to work and then run around the park or up the river to the apartment.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.19
(slaps forehead) · Of course, the reason I was running in the mornings was so I could be at home with L. at night.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.20
So, I went yesterday to cancel my membership and my timing is perfect.
bolt-eng-DF-199-194215-6530419_0452.21
I have another thirty days on my membership and luckily the locker runs out about the same time, so I can still run in the mornings for the next month and then switch to nights.

1) In Chemistry in year 9, I had this completely wet teacher.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.4
Bless him, he was jut totally dopey and stuttery and "eh?"

like.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.6
He had a fish tank in the class, and we would just spend most of the time watching them.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.7
Anyway, after the summer holidays, we went back.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.8
He told us he had something to announce regarding the fishes, and just about got out that one of them had grown a large tumour, when we turned around and there we saw it - one of the fishes had grown a turban tumour.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.9
It was sitting on his head and wobbling while he swam.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.10
I had tears streaming down my face and was just managing to splutter out "tumour fish, ahahahahaha tumour fish, tumour fish" - I had to leave the classroom for a wee in case I had an accident.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.11
Really awful, but hysterical.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.12

2) I still hyperventilate whenever I remember this.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.14
I have to give you a bit of context first:
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.15
My year 11 chemistry teacher was AWFUL.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.16
I mean awful.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.17
She always wore Christmas jumpers but not cheerful ones, just horrid greying ones with disgusting geometric patterns that showed she actually had no emotion and confirmed the notion that she was in fact a mouldy old hag.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.18
She had incredibly awful halitosis, which she would take great pleasure in breathing in people's faces when they asked her a question, or when she was telling someone off.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.19
She had a persistent, tinny, whiny voice that rattled straight through your head, cracking a few cells while it was at it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.20
Her intonations were so extreme it was ridiculous.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.21
You could hear her highlighting half of her words in italic just for the extra emphasis and the fact that she was clearly trying to be passionate about Chemistry when she was in fact a dull old bitch with grey, greasy hair.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.22
She also had such bad furrow lines she looked like a crumpled up carrier bag.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.23
And her facial expression never changed.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.24
She always had the constant ANGRY SURPRISED look with her eyebrows raised and the McDonalds M shaped forehead wrinkles.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.25
She went mental if anyone EVER interrupted her.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.26
This of course makes what happened even more brilliant.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.27
Bearing in mind I was in triple science and there wasn't enough time in the timetable for the 2 x 3 separate science lessons each week.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.28
So we had to have one of our Chemistry lessons on Wednesday after school.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.29
This particular week it had been snowing, and we were watching enviably as the double and single science kids, who had been hanging around school to piss teachers off, were lobbing snowballs at each other.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.30
Anyway, while Ms Porter (oh yes, Ms Porter) was mid sentence and we were just about to nod off, the door just FLUNG open, we heard a squeal of pure joy as it was lobbed and then we see this snowball flying towards her face, which hit her square in the forehead, skidded off her nose and hit the poor unsuspecting Chemistry-geek in the front row.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.31
Oh my. Considering I already have a habit of laughing in appropriate situations, this couldn't have been a worse opportunity.

About 40 minutes after everyone had stopped laughing, I was still going and still trying to choke it back - purple in the face with tears flowing, Porter just screamed "GET OOOOUUUUTTTTTT!!!!"
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.33
and I didn't stop laughing for about a week.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.34
One of my best all-time memories.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.36
God bless Ingsy's fish
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0198.38
not so much blessing the Porter though *shudders as she remembers the green phlegm that used to get launched at poor unsuspecting year 7's*
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0199.1
I was in America with my family and gran, and we were about to go on this old train up a mountain.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0199.2
The train started up and was billowing large amounts of sooty smoke into the air.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0199.3
My gran turns to me, chuckles, and goes "We're going to come off that looking like ni-----!"
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0199.4
There was about 5 seconds of stunned silence before I burst out laughing and didn't stop for about an hour.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0199.5
Thank god she said it in the car and not in front of other people!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0199.6
Another one: this person I worked with was telling me of her trip to Magaluf and how her friend fell off a balcony, which made me laugh as my friend had done something similar.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0199.7
She then goes "it's not funny, he was on the 5th floor and now he's in a coma".
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0199.8
I was quivering with laughter.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0199.9
I couldn't help it

*shudders*
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0200.5
I just googled "banana hammock".
bolt-eng-DF-200-192392-4566452_0200.7
I tend to find it really funny when people are arguing for some reason.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0001.2
This September I left home, and started at University.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0001.3
I was incredibly anxious about doing this, but rather delayed thinking about it until I got here!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0001.4
Now I'm here, and have been for over two weeks, I feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0001.5
I have been struggling emotionally for the majority of my life since moving to Secondary School, although I did lose my dad at around the age of 9 and always used to blame that for my feelings.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0001.6
I have had two periods of counselling in my life, over roughly 15 months from December 2009 until around March this year.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0001.7
I feel at the moment like the problems in my life are incredibly overwhelming, and are making me ever more doubtful of my always low self-esteem.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0001.8
I have no ability to concentrate on work, often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions, and doubt myself over anything and everything.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0001.10
I have tried to solve my problems before, and have found exercise and meditation particularly useful, and have also tried things like self-help books and tapes.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0001.11
But my general feeling, is, 'Is this what my life will be?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0001.12
My one chance at existance, my one chance of being a young man, I am wasting it!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0001.13
' And these feelings are beating away at me.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0001.14
I simply don't know what to do, and when I think of things to do, I never follow through with it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0001.15
Friends often say I'm lazy, and I can't disagree a lot of the time.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0001.16
I feel like everything anyone could do to help, people have tried, and time and time again I fail.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0003.1
Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to uni- you're definitely not alone there.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0003.2
But I would really recommend that you get an appointment with your uni counselling services.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0003.3
It doesn't really matter whether anyone has told you that you are depressed or not, you are obviously having some problems at the minute and could use some support- labels aren't as important as your experiences.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0003.4
Meditation and exercise are really helpful, so definitely try to do those.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0003.5
But yeah, you will have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere- but don't beat yourself up about feeling unmotivated to do anything at the minute, lots of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0003.6
Being unkind to yourself will only make you feel worse- be kind to yourself and get some help.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0004.1
I think a lot more people feel the same way as you do, but medicate themselves by using friends.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0004.2
Whilst it probably isn't a 'solution' as such, being around friends whilst being depressed is definitely better than being alone and being depressed.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0004.3
Either way, if you fancy a chat, feel free to PM
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0005.1
If i were you id focus on an idol.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0005.2

bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0005.3
Focus on what you want to achieve in life, you havent stated what your studying, or indeed why....
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0005.4
is it because you wanted the experience?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257046_0005.5

I won't go into the whole story here, but I've been best friends with this guy for about 5 years now, and for the last 2 years we've had something between us.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0001.2
Out of the blue the other week he suddenly told me he can't see us being more than friends, and never will.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0001.3
(after me staying over his lots for the past year, sleeping together all the time, texting/calling non-stop, him tell me I was the most important person in his life) · I was absolutely devastated.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0001.4
Throughout the time we were kind of together he slept with his ex a fair few times, including once about a month ago.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0001.5
I went to see another male friend last night who I know has a thing for me, and he started hitting on me and I let him have sex with me, until I realised I couldn't do it and stopped and made him take me home.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0001.6
I couldn't not tell the guy I loved.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0001.7
I told him, and he's angry and me, but he told me he didn't want me before I did it.

I know you are heartbroken but it's completely normal.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0004.7
Swallow your pride and apologise and tell them the situation got the better of you.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0004.8
You wer on the moving on stage which hurts the most BUT seriously tho, blaming yourself is def not worth it.

There's more to life than a couple of men.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0006.1
They will heal eventually, but its done now, the guy doesn't like you, it hurts I know, but you have to just get over it, find other people and friends to hang round with, I know you have lost your best friend and the person you loved, but there are many othe rpeople out there waiting for you to get to know them, look to the future and try not to let it get you down, cry if you need to, but dont harm anymore, it hurts the people that care about you more than you know..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0006.2
I hope it works out in the end...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.1
I'm so sorry you're feeling like this right now.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.2
You seem to be feeling very desperate for some kind of a solution to the situation; you say you feel you're life is over.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.3
It isn't, although I can relate to these feelings of desperation, that probably led to the self-harm.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.4
You probably feel like there is no other way to deal with what you're feeling right now, but I hope you can see that overcoming all this is an option.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.5
I think that feelings of self-blame may have also led to your self-harm; you describe feeling terrible and you may want to almost punish yourself because of the so-called 'mistakes' you have made.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.6
However, please remember that though these emotions are natural responses to what has happened (other people will have felt them many times before you), they are not necessarily the right ones.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.7
Although your emotional response may be clouding your judgement right this minute, you should realise that you are being too cruel and hard on yourself.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.8
The situation is going to be hard enough to get through - don't make it any harder by not loving and respecting yourself.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.9
I understand and do appreciate that this boy has formed a very important part of your life and that you must have become very attached to him.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.10
Whilst it is a wonderful thing to be able to connect with another person, sometimes this can blind us and we don't realise they are hurting us.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.11
I may be completely wrong here but I feel that you may have been letting him dominate you too much and define your self-worth a little too much and I don't like the way he effectively cheated on you/ wasn't 100% faithful to you by sleeping with this ex when he was with you, and then blames you for sleeping with this male friend of yours when he has breaken up with you.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.12
That's not right or fair and I think it's unhealthy for you because you're blaming yourself when he's effectively made a bigger mistake.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.13
You must know this deep down; you realise that he has hurt you more than you have him when you say 'how can he care he effectively broke up with me?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.14
' You deserve someone that is going to be firstly faithful to you and secondly respect your choices, should they choose to break up with you.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.15
He may have some very good attributes, and you may have passed some good times together, but realise that he has also been hurting you and you do deserve bettter - this fact should help you get over him.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.16
Why would you want to be with someone who cheats on you and makes you feel bad about yourself?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.17
He is just one chapter in your life; if you have been with him that long, and already another guy is interested in you, I'm sure you will have a fair few more romances in your time.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.18
I think you can get through this, and that you can use the bad experiences (as well as the good ones) to your advantage.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.19
Bottom line: Stop hating and harming yourself when you have nothing to feel bad about!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.20
Learn to love and respect and care for yourself.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.21
Stop idealising this character who has, when you look at things carefully, hurt you a lot.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.22
I'm sure you will get through this the same way many other people have succeeded in doing.

He's been making me feel terrible for doing something which I'm completely free to do, and which he seemed to be advocating by saying he couldn't see me as anything more than a friend.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.30
He can be very unfair and hypocritical.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192400-6257418_0013.31

i got advice get over urself and stop attention seeking why tell everyone u harm urself, sad or what
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0005.1
I wouldn't give a card or anything but maybe ask her out but ask her if she wants to go out for coffee the next day (so you're asking on valentines day but no pressure of it being on valentines day).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0005.2
Either way, best of luck
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0006.1
understood haha yh i thought a card would be a bit weird I'll just ask here out but how do i get rid of her mates she walks with
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0007.1
Pick your moment.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0007.2
Most of them will wander away if you get her to start talking to you.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0007.3
It's a natural thing.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0007.4
Or you could ask to talk to her for a minute - but that could be awkward.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0008.1
I would ask her on Thursday or Friday if she fancies going for a coffee/ drink at the weekend.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0008.2
It might be easier to tell her that you like her when aren't at uni (but I'm sure she'd know anyway if you ask her out).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0009.1
If she is very girlish, likes Disney, and romcom's, Valentine's day would be good.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0009.2
Make a rough judgement on whether she would like it and just go with your instinct
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0010.1
Just be casual, ask if she fancies grabbing a coffee or something to eat after/between lectures.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0010.2
If she's with her friends you could just ask to have a word with her, or try and sit next to her in your lecture and ask her there.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0010.3
Good luck
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0011.1
It also helps to strike up a casual conversation before asking, instead of outright asking.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0011.2
It will flow better.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0012.1

bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0015.2
An epic fail, I see her on monday and it will have to wait till then
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0015.4
This is turning into a soap opera, problem is on mondays she sits with her mates i don't have the courage to say something in front of them all.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0015.5
I'm just going to have to say ' can i have a word' or sit next to her.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0015.6
I was all hyped up for last week now my energys gone, i'm tired of waiting.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0015.7

bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0015.10

bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0016.1
If she says no, she clearly wasn't as wonderful as previously believed - so no harm done, you've evaded a date with a not-so-wonderful girl.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6250024_0016.2
If she says yes, then woo!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.1

bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.5
I also (obviously) really really fancy him.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.6
Of course, to make these feelings even worse I have a boyfriend.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.7
We've been going out for 3 years.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.8
I love him to bits, [No you don't, stop lying to yourself] but I feel like he doesn't always appreciate me like I wish he would.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.9
[I like how girls always use this excuse instead of just admitting they just don't love their partner anymore]
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.10
Things have been a bit crap with my and my boyfriend [Proves my earlier point] the last month or so, we haven't been seeing each other [You haven't been seeing each other?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.11
This is probably the most important point because it just shows your eyes and mind are straying now that your boyfriend is out of the picture] (he moved a short distance away so we agreed to be long distance for a short while, which we have been before and it's always been fine.)
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.12
So now I'm at a loss for what to do.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.13
The guy I've fallen for I think fancies me too (it's pretty obvious and his friends have told me he does) and we go together so well, people constantly assume we're a couple when we're together.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.14
He wants a relationship and if I didn't have a boyfriend I'd date him without a doubt, and I'm pretty sure he feels the same.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.15
But of course, I do have a boyfriend.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.16
[Seems to me like you're already thinking about "what ifs"...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.17
As in, "what if I got rid of my boyfriend and dated this guy instead?" ]
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.18
I'm just suffering for what to do.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.19
I'm not a cheater and never will be [In your mind you've already cheated by longing to be with someone else, possibly flirting and getting so close to them as if you're a couple, so there's no hope for that] but I don't know how to get over this 'crush' [more like a 'heavy infatuation' ].
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.20
Should I cut the new guy out of my life completely even though I feel we could go on to be really great friends?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.21
How do I repair the relationship with my boyfriend, or should I even?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.22
I feel like my boyfriend is such a nice guy he doesn't deserve a bitch like me who feels this way
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.24
[Lol, you've already said you don't think your boyfriend appreciates you and now you're saying you don't deserve him because you're a bitch?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.25
Which one is it?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.26
Make your mind up!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.27
Here's what I think: you don't love your boyfriend anymore and you wanna be with this other guy but you're making excuses to yourself like: "he doesn't deserve a bitch like me" or "he doesn't appreciate me" instead of just admitting you don't love him and you wanna be with someone else ]
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.28
Any advice?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.29
Has anyone been in this situation?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.30
I'm trying to ignore my feelings but basically I've found such a good friend and someone I click with so well and even if I never end up being his girlfriend I still want him as a friend.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.31
I think you should stop lying to yourself and admit what you really want, rather than make feeble excuses - that's my advice.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.32
If you truly loved your boyfriend you'd immediately know what to do and you might talk to him about it - or better yet - you wouldn't start fancying another guy just because you haven't being seeing him.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0013.33
EDIT: And stop trying to win the sympathy vote by constantly saying you feel like a bitch.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0014.4
This is ridiculous!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0014.5
She's not making excuses!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0014.6
She's on a forum saying how she really feels and is looking for advice!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0014.7
Although she definitely has been a bitch!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0014.8
OP, like others have said, you have definitely cheated.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0014.9
Why do people think that just because nothing physical has happened it automatically isn't cheating!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0014.10
What you have done is much worse than randomly kissing a stranger at a party while drunk!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0014.11
I think you should tell your boyfriend and face the consequences.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0014.12
You have really screwed up.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6252532_0014.13
Hopefully he dumps you before you hurt him even more!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.1
Random men approaching you in the street asking you personal questions and stalking you?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.2
Sometimes I could be walking in the street, minding my own ****ing business when a random bloke, usually foreign and black will ask me questions such as " Hello, whats your name?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.3
Where do you live?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.4
Do you have a boyfriend?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.5
" and sometimes just "Hi, how are you?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.6
" as if we know each other or something.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.7
Yesterday I was walking in the rain with my umbrella, wearing modest clothing (jeans, baseball jacket, Converses) when some random guy just starts talking to me like we know each other.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.9
The day before some chavvy looking bloke comes out of a store as I was walking past and nods his head at me like we know each other, and as I walked he kept turning around and then stopping in the middle of the street at some point.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.10
But the worst experience I've ever encountered was when I was 11, on my way to school one day when some guy asks me where a tube station is.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.11
So I say I dont know because I dont and walk away and he keeps following me and asks again.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.12
I say I dont know and then he proceeds to ask me personal questions.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.13
He asks me if I'm off to school and I say yes, then he asks me where I live, what my name is, etc. I tell him I dont speak to strangers but then I tell him I'm 11 in the hope that he'd back off but he didnt.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.14
He countined to follow me as I walked to the bus stop then said that he'd just like to know where x station is and that I "dont need to be afraid".
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.15
I tell him that I told him repeatedly that I dont know where the bloody station is and he just kept following me.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.16
What made things worse was that it was difficult to get help from anyone in the street because they thought that he knew me.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.18
I know some girls have experienced worser situations before, so I'd like to hear your experiences with this type of behaviour.

its not nice.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0043.23
The best thing to do is to be very blunt and just tell them you arnt interested and to not talk to you and then just ignore them or go find a normal looking guy to stand near/pretend to be with.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0044.1
Yeah.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0044.2
My old school is quite a well known known one in my town.

It has a very distincitive green uniform.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0044.4
Some old pervy guy one asked me if I was wearing green knickers.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0044.5
It wasn't a games afternoon, so I wasn't.

Hollaback!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.5
is a movement dedicated to ending street harassment using mobile technology.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.6
Street harassment is one of the most pervasive forms of gender-based violence and one of the least legislated against.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.7
Comments from âYouâd look good on meâ to groping, flashing and assault are a daily, global reality for women and LGBTQ individuals.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.8
But it is rarely reported, and itâs culturally accepted as âthe price you payâ for being a woman or for being gay.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.9
At Hollaback!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.10
, we donât buy it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.11
We believe that everyone has a right to feel safe and confident without being objectified.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.12
Sexual harassment is a gateway crime that creates a cultural environment that makes gender-based violence OK.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.13
There exists a clear legal framework to reproach sexual harassment and abuse in the home and at work, but when it comes to the streetsâall bets are off.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.14
This gap isnât because street harassment hurts any less, itâs because there hasnât been a solution.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.15
Until now.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.16
The explosion of mobile technology has given us an unprecedented opportunity to end street harassmentâand with it, the opportunity to take on one of the final new frontiers for womenâs rights around the world.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.17
By collecting women and LGBTQ folksâ stories and pictures in a safe and share-able way with our very own mobile phone applications, Hollaback!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.18
is creating a crowd-sourced initiative to end street harassment.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.20
breaks the silence that has perpetuated sexual violence internationally, asserts that any and all gender-based violence is unacceptable, and creates a world where we have an optionâand, more importantlyâa response.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0046.21
Although some of these incidents may not seem serious, it can be terrifying and humiliating to be approached by a man in this way and feel powerless to do anything about it.

a foreign guy once came up to me and a friend in starbucks and started asking me if i was single/married etc and that he liked me, he was like 40/50 and i was about 16 so i was properly freaked out :| i decided to have a laugh with the situation though since i knew i was in the safe public cafe, so i put my arm round my female friend and told him we were an item.

Walking to college once, I had on a pair of knee high socks and I wasn't wearing them in a slutty fashion at all - Then a wine-o said as I walked past him and his homeless buddies "Do you wear those socks to bed?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0101.2
heh heh" I felt like replying "Yeah I do because I actually have one"...

bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0101.4
Once walking back from college a guy stopped me and asked for directions.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0101.5
I didn't think much because he looked around 25-27.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0101.6
Then he started saying "Do you want to do some promoting for me?"
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0101.8
Erm..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0101.9
"No I have a job sorry" then he kept asking me questions about what my name was etc. I gave him a fake name, and he said he'd try adding me on Facebook after I kept on protesting that I'd add him on Facebook (yeah right)...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0101.10
Eventually he ended it with "Where do you work?"

Me and my friend were walking back to her house once and a car pulled up beside us.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0101.15
There were two young chavvy guys and one asked to my friend "Do you go to 'random school'" and we just ignored them.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0101.16
They kept on revving up and pulling up beside us until my friend just said "No" to try and shut them up.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0101.17
Then they tried asking for her name etc, I was completely ****ting myself.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0101.18

It's horrible when you realise you have to walk past one and even if you ignore them you can see them staring out of the corner of your eye.

This sort of happened to me once recently.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0102.2
It was quite late and I was walking home when this man came right up to me and started walking really close to me.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0102.3
I think he asked me if I wanted to go somewhere, and then I'm pretty sure he said something about my breasts, so I indicated that I'd like to be left alone.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0102.4
And then he responded with the immortal words:
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0102.5
"F*ck you then.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253595_0102.6

bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0152.15
It adds up fast.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0152.16
Yes people find 'ways' to deal with it, but is that healthy for a child?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0152.17
Just scraping by?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0152.18
Living on the bare minumum wages, and or government support, family support and child support?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0152.19
You can wave your moral flags all you like in regards to abortion, but the way I see it, willingly bringing a child into the world when you really know you're not prepared or financially secure is, in my mind completely wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0152.20
Disgusting.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0152.21
I agree with you - situations of this sort are very common these days and guys AND girls ought to take a lesson out of it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0152.22
I don't know why some posts on here assume this is a troll though!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0152.23
Why would someone just want to make up a whole scenario just for the fun of it (+ she didn't post anonymously).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0152.24
Poor Girl.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0153.5
Sooner
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.1
No they don't, but shouldn't they?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.2
The father did all he could to prevent pregnancy.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.3
The condom splitting during sex isn't his fault.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.4
You said it was, which is absolutely laughable.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.5
Are you to suggest that he's to pull out after each thrust to check for a split?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.6
They noticed afterwards, and it was then out of the man's hands.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.7
He asked her to take a morning after pill, which again, is the most he could have done in the circumstances to prevent pregnancy.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.8
Let's say the man wanted to keep the baby, but the woman took the morning after pill.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.9
The man's opinion was irrelevant, and the woman absolved all responsibility.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.10
Despite the fact that according to you this is "both of their fault's", sole decision lies with the woman and she does not have to accept the consequences of something which according to you was partially her fault.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.11
Now let's consider the opposite, the man wants rid of the baby, but the woman wants the baby (as is the case here, given that he told OP to take morning after pill).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.12
Surely, if we have equal rights, the man should be allowed to completely absolve responsibility, regardless of the wishes of the female.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.13
The man quite clearly cannot get an abortion as it's the woman's body, but why should he have to support a child financially against his wishes?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.14
Forcing the man to financially support the child is analogous to banning the woman from taking the morning after pill or having an abortion.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.21
Men have one form of birth control - condoms.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.22
Women have plenty more.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.23
And then the final say.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.38
+1 to both of these posts, remind me to rep you both tomorrow as I've already run out of rep for today!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.39
From a woman's point of view, I'd just like to add that it's sad that some women keep/abort babies regardless of the father's views.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.40
I know that my boyfriend and I have an agreement in place that I would seek an abortion if I ever fell pregnant, but I would still consult him first, as it's his decision as much as mine in my opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0154.41
Just wanted to add some female support to your posts
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0155.1
Just because a majority think it's ok to use, that doesn't make it less wrong
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0155.2
Erm, yeah, it kinda does...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0155.3
It used to be considered wrong for women to work, to have a role other than that of a housewife and mother.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0155.4
Then the majority changed their minds, and now it's not wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0155.5
I don't know whether it used to be considered wrong to use "retarded" in the way we use it now.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0155.6
But the majority now think it's fine.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0155.7
So I'll continue to object to your objection!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0156.4
Well I object to your objections of my objections.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0157.1
You need/must tell him, but i have a strange feeling he is going to run away..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0157.2
if he is 19 and is 'a couple of year older than' you, then HOW OLD ARE you?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192403-6253769_0158.2
Bah, well I obj- ah, never mind

Yes I did see this lol!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0015.2
But I figure 20,000 is a heck of a lot...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0015.3
both arms probably took around 100 between them (if that) so 12 weeks will be 1200 in total leaving me plenty left to do other areas.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0015.4
So you still get a lot compared to lots of other machines I've read up about.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0015.5
I will change my original post though lol.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0015.6
I suppose it depends on how 'permanent' it'll be or if they will need topping up every 6 months or so...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0015.7
if they do, I'll probably still try to return it as it's not permanent like it says it should be or will just find out how much the replacement piece of kit is and if it's reasonable and it's working well for lengthy periods will just buy that.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0015.8
I will be zapping them again tomorrow and shaving them again tonight.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0015.9
It's been a week and although quite a few of the hairs have grown back it's nowhere near as course/noticable as I thought it would be so I'm quite pleased so far!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0015.10
Fair enough, I was expecting it to be more like one per hair.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0016.18
I have used it for nearly 30 weeks now.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0016.19
I've been using it on my underarms, feet, upper lip, bikini area and forearms.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0016.20
My underarms worked best and barely grew back anymore.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0016.21
My bikini area was starting to work really well asell.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0016.22
Then I stopped using it for about 4 weeks after using it every week for 18.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0016.23
It all grew back.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0016.24
I've started using it again weekly but given that I have pale skin and very dark hairs and use it on the highest setting...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0016.25
I think I may be demading my money back.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0016.26
All the positive reviews tend to be those who have done 4 treatments.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4702747_0016.27
I think it shocks the hair so it doesn't grow back quickly but if you stop using it, its not perminent
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.1
Today, I had a really hurtful comment said to me.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.2
A few months ago, Id have broke down in tears but today I didnt.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.3
A teacher called me ugly today.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.4
I was thinking about surgery and have for the longest time.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.5
I have always been really insecure but then recently I've felt grateful.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.6
Im always comparing myself to others and what I have noticed is that not all BUT alot of pretty girls are arrogant.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.7
Even when they are funny, smart etc, they are often self absorbed and critical of others.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.8
Ive even noticed that some of them appear to feel like their main "worth" is their looks.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.9
(if that makes sense) · Ive developed a good personality, have lots of friends but Im ugly/average.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.10
If I wasnt ugly, I may have been like some of these girls and thats the ONLY thing thas has ever helped me with my insecurities.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.11
I probably would have a completely different personaluty and I would probably be a completely different person, obviously physically but also mentally.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.12
Sometimes, I still cry. Im often treated as inferior to other girls because of how I look and people do make comments even if its not intentionally.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.13
But for once I feel grateful.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.14
i dont think if I could have been born didfferently that Id want to.

Anyone else feel like this?

No one is ugly my friends, God created everyone according to his will.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0081.17
The beauty is in the eyes of people who look at you, I'm sure you'll find someone who finds you very beautiful in your life.

Tell your teacher to piss off.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0084.2
I'm pretty sure you could complain to the head about that.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0084.4

I commented on a show we were watching and the presenter.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0085.2
I mentioned absolutely nothhing about her looks.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0085.3
And he(my teacher said), well your not exactly the prettiest girl in the world, as if it was relevant.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0085.4
I didnt know what to say.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0085.5
Everyone went "ooooo" and I pretended not to care.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0085.6
I was just glad I didnt break down crying.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0085.8
Report him.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0085.9
Send him off to an early retirement!

Thats the same as me!!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.2
I was bullied in secondary school cos I wasnt one of the 'popular' girls who always had bfs and were basically slags.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.3
I wasnt unpopular (i had a great group of friends) I didnt wear make up in school because I didnt see the point.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.4
and cos of that people were horrible and called me ugly.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.5
Its made me who I am today.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.6
I dont think im ugly at all and quite often get complimented on how 'fit' or 'pretty' I am..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.7
Im not stunning by a long shot but thats not the point lol.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.8
I do wear make up now and make an effort but I feel better in myself knowing that I can go out without make up and still feel confident wereas all the girls I went to school with have some kind of nervous breakdown if they dont look 'perfect'.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.9
Who the hell cares at the end of the day?!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.10
Exactly, i had great group of friends too.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.11
They were the popular ones but im the only one left behind because i was also busy with my academics and extra curricular activities.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.12
LOL i was laughing when i realised something that were too young to wear make up in secondary school anyways.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.14
I started wearing make up at age 19.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.15
until then, i liked putting make up but not too much.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.16
It just makes me feel better when i go out.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.17
Im not beautiful that a guy will look twice when they pass by me.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0086.18
At least we make ourselves feel better and not affected by those insecure girls who wear tonnes of make up.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192410-4717356_0087.1
People who make comments on other peoples appearances are generally insecure with their own, so take no notice because at least you are more secure than they are.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0108.1
I too was a bit disappointed.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0108.2
I really wanted to see Neville's parents and the entire hospital scene.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0108.3
Someone said earlier that it didn't flow and it looked like a sequence of scenes, I didn't understand what they meant until I saw the movie.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0108.4
In the beginning in the playground scene, it felt like I was watching some indie film, the cinematography for me was kind of strange.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0108.5
The possession part was done well and I think they made it seem like Cho was in their year.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0108.6
The fact that they made Bellatrix use the killing curse (green) as a opposed to the stunning curse(red) made it seem like they wanted to get across that sirius was dead.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0108.7
And if JK said the mirror has a role why didn't they mention it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0108.8
I realised that the movies are just the basics of the Harry Potter plot.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0108.9
They leave out so much which in fact was what draws us to the HP books.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0108.10
We spend time debating on the little mysteries of HP but the movies will never be able to portray all this.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0109.1
I loved the film.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0109.2
Yeah its disappointing when they get rid of what are important scenes but there is no way they can fit everything in. Its hard but I try and view the films as a separate entity.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0109.3
Luna was amazing, exactly how I thought she'd be.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0109.4
Wasn't too impressed with the ministry, was expecting a bit more than that.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0109.5
The main problem for me is the actors are getting old.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0109.6
Don't suppose you can stop that though.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0109.7
Can't wait for the boooooook....
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0110.1
well after reading Deathly Hallows and this film, there will be some inconsistencies:
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0110.2
This is in a spoiler for that that have not finished or started the last book:
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0110.3
Spoiler: · There was no mention of Regulus or his locket in the film so that will be a problem for the film to cram in that or they will remove it (They like to say adapt) · The mirror that Sirius gave to Harry in the books is needed in book 7 but they removed that as well in the film so that will be changed · Rant over but Umbridge was done really well and I suppose it foreshadows her later involvement with the Death Eaters in the MuggleBorn Registration Commission.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0110.4
Nonetheless knowing them, they will also cut that as well
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0111.1
Very Disappointed.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0111.2
Felt like shouting out to the whole cimena to read the books instead and that this was the tip fo the iceberg.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0111.3
And i agree witht he persona pew posts up.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0111.4
The guy who played Dumbledore in the 1st film was PERFECT.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0111.5
Pity he passed away though.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0111.6
I also agree, this dumbledore is waaaay too hasty and angry.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0112.1
Agreed with Gambon being a far too aggressive Dumbledore.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0112.2
I don't think he's been convincing enough to be able to play Dumbledore in the final two books; we learn so much more about his character in those.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0112.3
About the locket - I think they'd just make out that it was in the Black household without having mentioned it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0112.4
Or they may now put it into OOTP somewhere?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192431-6336193_0112.5
They also didn't show Lily (iirc) in Snape's worst memory, so I don't know how they're going to manage the whole Snape/Lily storyline.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0103.1
Well, churches won't be forced to marry gay couples anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0103.2
I'm pretty sure they don't even have to marry straight couples - my local Catholic church only marries people who regularly attend mass.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0103.3
Gay couples should be allowed to take the same secular marriage vows as straight people, and if certain churches wish to marry gay couples, like the Quakers, they should be free to do that, too.

Extending the right to marry to homosexuals doesn't infringe upon the rights of anybody else or upon any religion, religious or not.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0103.5
In England, the Church of England pretty much has to marry anyone who meets the residency requirements (live/born in the parish, or have a relative with some connection to the parish), all the others can pick and choose.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0103.6
I think if gay marriage is legalised here though, that the decision would be left down to individual churches.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0104.3
Ah, I see.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0104.4
I don't really have much experience of the CoE, so I wasn't aware of that.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0104.5
But yeah, they certainly won't be forced to marry gay people.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0105.3
They cannot refuse to discriminate marrying people anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0105.4
They are part of the state.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0105.5
If they want to pick and choose then disestablish.

Then I'll cut my hair to.5, meet up with some BNPers and form a religion to promote anti-miscegenation laws.

Then we'll see how readily accepted theological excuse is for discrimination.

Churches are not simply 'old buildings' they are places of worship.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0106.2
For some people, like myself, they are where I take my sacraments, go to mass etc. I don't understand homosexuality, but I respect that people do not answer to me and it is not for me to judge.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0106.3
However, unless a gay couple can hand on heart tell me that you are marrying but will remain celibate then I believe that such couples are mocking a mockery of the sacrament.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0106.4
It is the physical act that is condemned.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0106.5
The same goes for non-religious couples, there should a conversion and a long standing commitment to the church before a wedding is allowed to take place.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0106.6
Would anyone dare try this with Judaism or Islam, of course not, because they would not tolerate it and Christianity is an easy touch.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0106.7
Marriage is for a man and a woman for the procreation of children at its most basic level and in Christianity with a commitment before God.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0106.8
If he does not sanction your union and you know that you are committing a sin before you enter into the sacrament why do it?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0106.9
Because you can?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0106.10

I have absolutely nothing against homosexual people, one of my good friends is gay and he is lovely and I have total respect for him.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0107.2
But I do not agree that churches should allow gay marriage.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0107.3
Gay couples can wed elsewhere, I don't understand why they would want to marry in a place based on rules and views that disagree with their relationship.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0107.4
Is it just because of the fancy portrayal of church weddings in the media?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0107.5
The rights of gay people should be respected, but so should be the rights of religious people and the church.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0107.6
If churches allow gay marriage, they are going against their views and beliefs, just to allow a gay couple to have a 'fancy church wedding'.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0107.7
I don't understand how it is so necessary for a gay couple to get married in a church, that the church should be forced to let go of their beliefs.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0107.8
It's not about modernising the church, because no matter what, churches go by the bible which will never change, and somewhere in the bible it advises against gay marriage.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0107.9
This will not change so gay couples should just respect christianity and steer clear of churches - unless they are actually regular church goers, I think that requires a different argument.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0107.10
EDIT: I'd just thought I'd point out that my main question is what would actually draw a gay couple to marry in a church?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0107.11
I'm not trying to condemn homosexuality.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0107.12
I just don't understand because churches are against gay relationships so why would a gay couple want to wed there, unless they are trying to prove a point or something?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0107.13
So you support apartheid?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0108.2
why dont you try discussing the argument at hand?

Why don't you stop butting into other peoples' posts?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0110.2
It's not called butting in when one tries to direct the conversation back on topic.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-15905880_0111.1

As a citizen you have signed an implicit contract with the nation state.

If your state happens to be successful, that is, if it happens to grant you a safe living environment, support against life's ills, and the right to express yourself, then of course you should feel a connection to it.

You claim the Argentinian army is useless, provide no evidence to back up your claim, and that attack me for not being knowledgeable.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0052.2
Ok...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0052.3
Ok,...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0052.4
let's put it into context.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0052.5
In 1981, Argentina was ruled by the military from what I remember.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0052.6
They sent their best forces and got annihilated.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0052.7
Today, an overestimated Argentinian military expenditure is about 5 billion dollars.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0052.8
An underestimate of British expenditure is about 60 billion dollars.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0052.9
So, they really have no chance.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0052.10
I am not going to waste any more time on the issue on imaginary scenarios of Argentinian Espionage when they do not even have a military budget to defend their own country.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0053.1
No, we shouldn't.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0053.2
But there's no need to react militarily to the problem, when the Argentinians won't be able to keep up that activity for long in the first place.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0053.3
We can send extra forces to the garrison, send an extra frigate down there, schedule some training for another battalion, perhaps even send a high profile member of the Royal Family down there [hmm.......
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0053.5
] and gently remind Argentina what they already know: that they can't do anything other than shout.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0053.6
The British people know full well that we can't afford endless operations, but that our Armed Forces have the strength required to resist any attack.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0053.7
The rest of the world couldn't care less.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0053.8
Britain is without an aircraft carrier for the first time, and is downsizing significantly its armed forces.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0053.9
The message Britain sends to the rest of the world when it responds with diplomatic "complaints" to blockades and embassy sackings is one of weakness.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807752_0053.10
The British, if they are as capable as you say they are, should send ships to end the blockade.

So a 10 year old deaf girl was brought into the UK in 2000 where she was treated basically as a slave and was repeatedly physically and sexually abused during her enslavement.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807771_0001.3
So many things wrong with this case, even putting aside the question of how our border agency somehow failed to stop a 10 year old deaf girl from Pakistan who didn't speak a word of English entering the country, they taught her to sign her own name so she could claim benefits.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807771_0001.4
So a girl, who they have no record of started claiming benefits, said girl was deaf and unable to speak, she didn't have any form of communication other than possibly visual (no evidence of that) with whatever benefit officials were in charge of her case and said benefit officials never bothered to check if she was actually being cared for?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807771_0001.5
How can this not set of some kind of alarm?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807771_0001.6
I'm going to be honest i have very little knowledge of how the benefit system works in this country but presumably to claim job seekers/disability allowance/ incapacity allowance someone needs to have some form of direct contact with you?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807771_0001.7
If you claim carers allowance for someone then an official must check you are actually caring for the person?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807771_0001.8
Could someone please set me straight and tell me that they must have manipulated the benefit system in a massive way by tricking whoever they sent to check on the girl and our government didn't just hand over tax payers money without any confirmation the girl was even being looked after and effectively helped to fund slavery?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807771_0001.9
Instead the girl was made to cook, clean, do the washing and ironing for the Ashars and clean the houses and cars of their family and friends, the court heard.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807771_0001.10
And none of these people ever suspected that the girl was being abused?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807771_0001.11
How the hell was this allowed to happen for over 10 years?

the base doesnt just provide the americans with a handy little tick on their tally sheet for military instillations it serves as a vital instilation for forward projection power across the globe, its been used for afghanistan, iraq, libya and countless other missions have taken off from there.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807795_0017.10
my point is that whilst it is of course very sad the islanders were removed would the benefits to millions [hear me out here] that having the base their not out weigh them?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807795_0017.11
one could argue that without having bases like this around the globe the americans ability to topple dictators as part of NATO for the good of these countries would have been severely effected.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807795_0017.12
Fair enough, I couldn't think of a decent island, so I just used Shetland as a lame example.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807795_0017.13
My point about India and China is that together they will be overtaking the US in terms of military spending by 2025.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807795_0017.14
And if things go as I feel they will, the global South will start to dominate the North, whilst the US will lose a lot of what it currently has, I have a feeling that the rise of more superpowers and India's heavy population in Mauritius will mean that it is unlikely that the US will be able to maintain a military base so close to Mauritius.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807795_0017.15
(Mauritius effectively 'belongs' to India, it's heavily influenced by them would probably be the best way to put it).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807795_0017.16
So the chances in the short-term are yes, very unlikely, but what's the point in campaigning for anything if they're not achievable in the long run?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807795_0017.17
You talk about dictators etc. You're telling me that by not using some other base in Europe for example, America couldn't have achieved those aims?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807795_0017.18
I highly doubt it, there is no need to remove an entire population for self-gain.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807795_0018.1
While you're there OP, make sure you campaign for every territory on earth which has been populated by force to be returned to there original inhabitants.

They were forcibly expelled from Diego Garcia so the British could sell off the land to the Americans so they could build a torture centre/military base there.

it's short but if you don't want to read it basically a guy in the USA has been arrested for agreeing to meet up with and have sex with a "14 year old girl" who was actually an undercover cop...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0001.3
surely this is entrapment?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0001.4
he didn't actually do anything because they basically lead him into the situation?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0001.5
sure, it would be a crime if he had actually done this with a 14 year old and something had happened when they met up...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0001.6
but the american police have basically created this whole scenario and lead him into it, feeding him along?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0001.7
He was arrested after agreeing to meet with her Jan. 12.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0001.8
this suggests to me that the police officer was the one who suggested everything...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0001.9
coaxed him into it...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0001.10
we don't know the full story but i get the impression that this "14 year old girl" offered him sex on a plate willingly....
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0001.11
would that be legal in this country?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0001.12
i mean i think it's wrong that this guy would meet up with a 14 year old with the intent to have sex...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0001.13
but fabricating the situation...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0001.14
you can't arrest someone for something they haven't done...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0001.15
it's just wrong...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0001.16
am i the only one who thinks this is messed up?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0002.1
If she suggested it his defence will destroy the case
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0003.1
From previous similar stories, what usually happens is that the undercover officer behind the screen is extremely passive (as a normal young innocent teenager would probably be) and then agrees to meet up with the potential paedophile, if he shows up at the place then he is guilty.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0003.2
I see nothing wrong with this morally, he knows the girl is 14 and still decides to meet her (having previously stated his intentions through IM).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0004.1
You've never seen Dateline?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0004.2
Please, take a seat...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0005.3
if that is the case then i understand and agree, it's just the way the article is written it sounds as if the police officer is doing a lot of the work, and it's in america so different laws to here.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0006.1
They do this and it works, there is even a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Catch_a_Predator">show</a> about it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0006.2
To me its fine, if the suspect has to make a choice, ie leave his home and go to a location, then I don't really care if he is encouraged.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0038.1
14 is illegal, same as 10, both are morally wrong and disgusting.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0038.2
If he agreed to do it under the illusion it was a real 14 year old, how do we know he hasn't already done it before, or wouldn't in the future, he must have been looking to have stumbled across the 14 yr old police woman.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0038.3
I think its a good thing
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0038.4
yeah its totally a good thing that police are allowed to trick people to get convictions
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0039.2
He agreed to meet with a 14 year old for sex, and your on his side?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0040.1
He should be arrested, if he knew she was 14 (like some have said, she could have sent older-looking pics and lied about her age).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0040.2
I don't think the police are wrong for the method they used.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0040.3
Why wait for 14 year olds to be raped or w.e before arresting people?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0040.4
Surely it's better to be safe than sorry on serious matters like this?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0041.1
Paedophile or not, arranging to meet with a 14 year old for sex is ****ing wrong and he knows it, so he should rightly be punished.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0041.2
Anyone that disagrees needs their head testing, or locking up !

lol ok, this is starting to sound like a dictatorship..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0041.4
tricking people into "comitting crimes" and locking away anyone who disagrees.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0042.1
he is not a paedophile because she isn't pre pubescent...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0042.2
i'm not saying it isn't wrong i'm saying paedophilia is a strong word and not the right one to use.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0042.3
Not this debate again
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0042.5
can we not accept that "paedophile" is used as a sort of umbrella term
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0042.6
Anyone else confused as to how a 14 year old became an undercover cop in the first place?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0042.8
You utter buffoon/comic genius!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0043.3
so the end justifies the means?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0044.5
i'm not disagreeing that it is wrong, but i don't think coaxing someone into doing something they might not otherwise do, which is the impression that the article give, is a good way about catching "criminals"...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0044.6
maybe my interpretation of the article is wrong or maybe the author isn't very clear...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0044.7
but i don't think it's right that you can basically reel someone in to POTENTIALLY comitting a crime (he did not sleep with a 14 year old) then arrest them on that basis.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0045.16
Not sure if someone's already mentioned this, but a TV programme called "To Catch A Predator" did this - Chris Hansen basically set up stings and then publicly filmed them when he revealed himself to them.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0045.17
Not sure if they lead to arrests, I think they did
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0046.3
I'm baffled at how you can be on his side.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0046.4
He has the intention of sleeping with a minor, which is not only illegal but immoral.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0046.5
If the police arrest a man with detailed plans for blowing up a building in a city, with all the equipment for making a bomb, but he hasn't actually made it yet, would you be on this man's side too?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0046.6
I think not, I think you'd be glad they intervened and took one potential bomber off the streets, much like they've took one potential child rapist of the streets here.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0047.3
There's a significant difference here - the paedophile caught would have been looking on forums and the like FOR young girls.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0047.4
It's not like the girl turned up on his doorstep, stripped and then they arrested him.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0048.1
The man was ****ing 41 years old
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0048.3
Good
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0048.5
People have their preferences.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0048.6
Many centuries ago, so-called "paedophilia" would not even have been frowned upon.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0048.7
You must know morality is relativity, right?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0048.8
I mean many centuries ago, if you were known for killing ferocious men in foreign lands, you were praised by your people for valiant behaviour, bravery etc.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0164.1
But the fact he agreed shows he has it within him to do that.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0164.2
Just because a '14 year old girl' offers sex is every man going to accept that, no.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0164.3
One less paedophile on the streets.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0164.4
but is a guy who's willing to have sex with a 14 year old girl therefore definitely a paedophile though?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0164.5
in many countries that'd be completely legal
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0165.16
I think this is more widely allowed and used in the USA than here.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0165.17
I suppose if they wanted to have a really good case against him, they would have to be extremely passive and let him do most of the work.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0165.18
Personally I don't see anything wrong with it - he was gonna do it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0165.19
They may have just prevented a child from being raped
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0166.16
I'm not sure its entrapment really.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0166.17
Entrapment is where the person has no other choice than to comply.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0166.18
Eg busting an undercover cop for buying drugs or a civilian for buying drugs under threats of violence.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0167.1
Why are people defending him?!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0167.2
The fact that he even agreed is sooo messed up!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0167.3
So maybe the punishment is harsh because he didn't really 'do' anything, but still, even the thought of chatting to her is wrong!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0167.4
Stop cutting him slack.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0167.5
Because it's been established that this form of attraction, is in fact quite normal in some cases and not necessarily perverted.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3807981_0167.7
We are not necessarily defending this particular individual - just saying it's possible for there to be a very normal attraction between a man and some young girls - if she reciprocates then it should be between them.

And for the record, infrastructure built by the British in India was done to facilitate the exporting of raw materials from India to Britain.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808114_0124.8
It's no coincidence that most colonial infrastructure was concentrated around port cities (Mumbai, Cochin) and centers of administration (Delhi, Kolkata).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808114_0124.9
Ports, railways were built for the movement of material.

What about roads in rural India?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808114_0124.12
If your argument of Britain building infrastructure for the benefit of Indians is true, why is it that after 200+ years of British rule was India not one of the leading industrial nations, instead of the second poorest nation in the world at independence?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808114_0124.13
Indian industry was dismantled by the British along with its education system by leveraging high property taxes that the Indians could not afford to pay.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808114_0124.14
At the same time Indians were forced to grow cash crops such as cotton, which were price-fixed (at a lower value) by the British and exported to Britain to be manufactured into goods sold at a higher price.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808114_0124.15
Just one of several ways Britain grew its wealth at the expense of India.

Perhaps you could enlighten me as to the specifics regarding the ''better methods of farming and economic models'' the British introduced?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808114_0126.3
Many of the poorer farmers could not afford to grow food crops due to a combination of high tax on these goods and low prices fixed by British policy.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808114_0126.4
Instead Indian farmers were forced to grow cash crops such as cotton and rubber which again were price-fixed but would fetch them enough money to feed themselves, while providing cheap raw materials for export to British factories.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808114_0126.5
Example: When the American civil war broke out and cotton could not be bought from the CSA for fear of riling the Union, where did the world's cotton come from, yes Britain, by way of India.

I think to look at as a some sort of race between who's committed more violence isn't very useful in proving anything, as in all racial groups you have people committed crimes.

The divides between us are incredibly small, the colour of our skin, the main issue here, is just down to our exposure to a big ole thing in the sky, based on where we were born/lived.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808114_0312.5
Regardless of the factuality of PDC, The Lord's Resistance Army is proof that African culture (corruption, bribery, witchcraft, rape as a form of control, killing people because they come from a different area) is something we shouldn't welcome here.

However, there are cultures that just should not be welcome here: including wahabbist teachings of pushing homosexuals of buildings.

Multiculturalism is too wishy washy and we need a common denominator of culture that all agree to to be a citizen (freedom of speech, equal rights regardless of faith sexuality sex or skin colour etc).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808114_0312.9
There are aspects of secondary culture (such as eating habits) that can work multiculturally if a nation wished it to be, but multiculturalism shouldn't be forced on a nation.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808280_0082.2
indeed, the monarchy is technically theocratic but thats it has evolved over the centuries - it used to be an absolute monarchy and is now just a constitutional one, we can keep our traditions as long as they evolve to meet the needs of the current generation.

the queen is the best person for the job.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808280_0082.7
the queen making a visit to the republic was a big deal, there were some protests from hardliner irish republicans, and general apathy from the rest of the population.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808280_0082.8
but the irish were bowled over when queen came over and paid her respects to irishmen who fought for britain and those who fought for independence from britain, to her bowing in honour of the victims of the first bloody sunday to even ex-IRA members.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808280_0082.9
most people in england and ireland agreed her laying the wreath and paying her respects was a great moment in anglo-irish relations - a lot of irish people said it drew a line under things.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808280_0082.10
now imagine if an elected nobody, perhaps even if david cameron took on the role of president as well as prime minister, would anyone cared or even have noticed if cameron went to ireland to lay down a wreath?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808280_0082.11
would the irish have considered david cameron coming over to lay a wreath it a big step foward in irish-english reconcilliation?

bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808280_0082.18
I havent been brought up with any views my family are also divided over the monarchy, I have just looked at the situation from a neutral point of view and come to the view that we do not need a monarchy.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808280_0082.19
Also I wouldn't advise it be best to have David Cameron filling both roles, we need two different people for each role.

There are other reasons too, but the main ones is that we dont need them, it also is undemocratic and on a personal note, as an aethiest i cannot agree with anyone appointed into a postion such as the head of state by god as i do not believe he is real.

How could a woman know that a rapist is in the vicinity?

Should she just assume so because it is a dark and secluded place?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808330_0376.7
All attacks (all crimes, really) can be avoided simply by being in a different place at the time, that doesn't make it the victims' fault.

I have never said that she was right not to take a taxi because the danger shouldn't have been there, as many people seem to have interpreted my comment.

Holmes was saying that she should have taken a taxi home, but what use is that when she had already been raped?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808330_0376.14
We should be advising women on how to be safe at night, and that includes taking taxis when needed and perhaps making some forms of self defence legal, as some have suggested, rather than making examples of women who have been raped.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808330_0376.15
We should also work towards changing peoples preconceptions about rape, work towards improving rape prosecution statistics and prison sentences among other things and we might be able to decrease the number of rape cases.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808330_0376.16
By fault, I didn't mean it as in 'her fault she got raped har har' - I mean, if one exercises caution, these things can be prevented.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808330_0377.1
It's not about the cost.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808330_0377.2
The reason women are being raped is because they're powerless.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808330_0377.3
If the government is ****ty enough to not be able to provide protection for them then they should be allowed weapons.

No one needs to constantly be on their toes "plan in advance" like some people suggested or to avoid taking short cuts.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808330_0377.6
If you hear of a man getting brutally murdered and robbed in a dark alleyway you won't be busy blaming his lack of rational thinking and saying he should have taken a taxi because men are more able to protect themselves in physical situations.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808330_0377.7
Since women are at a natural disadvantage, people naturally blame them more for not taking more precaution.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808330_0377.8
The solution: cancel out the differences by providing women with a means to protect themselves in order for them to avoid the inconvenience of "thinking in advance".
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808330_0377.9
Of course I don't think this is a necessity, but it's a partially silly solution in response to the ridiculously stupid statement some people here made about women being partially to blame for rape.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808330_0377.10
How can the government protect every female?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808330_0377.11
it doesn't make them ****ty. If you can't answer this with an actual viable reason you're also ****ty.

do you carry a rape alarm?

most likely the answer is no to both, so once again the weapon thing isn't a solution and would be very open to abuse.

The only countries that would be able to implement this already have birth rates below replacement (or will do soon) The only area of real population growth in the future is going to be Africa, and I can't imagine any African states being able to exert this level of control and organisation on their citizens.

Limiting the number of children people can have is an infringement of their rights.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808491_0004.2
If you discouraged people from having children by increasing taxes on families with more children then that would be a much more humane way of controlling population.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808491_0004.3
Despite this, I still think that technology will always develop to incorporate a larger world population.

I think the first guy has a point, there is wanting something good for yourself and there is greed.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808850_0005.2
The £50m and £100m example, with either of those you are living a very very nice life.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808850_0005.3
Its greedy to look at what you have and then justify giving yourself the other £50m when you have workers barely making end meet, or in some cases you are still laying off staff.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808850_0005.4
I'm happy to see capitalism in the market in general, but its not a healthy thing to have dictating society in general.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808850_0005.5
On a smaller scale, I think companies should show more loyalty to workers, and a more even approach to the way pay/benefits is distributed in the workforce.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808850_0005.6
The pay gap between those those on the front line of business and those at the top is too large.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808850_0005.7
There is increased responsibility and experience required at the top and they should be paid more, but there is no justification for paying someone at the top of a business a huge salary and then on top of that bonus worth millions when the company hasn't performed well, there have been serious failings on the part of the people at the top and the direction of the company, and then to freeze pay, give no bonus to normal workers, who may have performed exceptionally but with the wrong targets and instructions from the top, and in some cases cut jobs.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808850_0005.8
The gap is far too large and is increasing at a rate there is no justification other than greed.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808850_0005.9
In many ways I don't think this is pure capitalism, this change in boardroom pay isn't dictated by the market, its dictated by people within the business wanting a larger slice of profits.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808850_0005.10
To get those profits year in year out, they are pushing workers harder and harder, cutting pensions, cutting benefits, effective pay cuts, all to generate a profit that isn't being used for the good of the business, just a very small group of workers.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3808850_0005.11
I do think the Occupy/99% thing is about far more than just Wall Street, its about the failings of society and many people''s gripes should really lie with the gov rather than an employee on wall street.

Personally feel sorry for the police; everyone is the country (apart from the do-gooders) is egging them on to use their bloody baton instead of shoving them, but as the news stalk the police, they can't do much because then sky news or bbc play constant replays of the incidents- 'Did the officers use extreme force here' 'that man was knocked off his bike' 'how do we know he planned to use the concrete brick in his hand' etc!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0003.2
Oh and to state the obvious what started out as a stupid protest (protesting about an armed drug dealer/gangster being shot, whether he shot first or whatever) to young kids thinking they deserve what they want without working for it (todays culture of putting everything on credit cards etc to get things now) and then the oppertunists who see it as a way to make some quick money (please note, to the woman shown on sky news stealing a carpet, and the man stealing a kilo bag of rice, you are stupid)
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0003.3
I also see a lot of it as people who come over here are used to getting benefits,housing, medical care etc so think why shouldn't they have big fancy tv's and designer clothes?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0003.4
we are a country who are too soft, do what austrailia do, let the brain surgeons in and keep the scroungers out (also i am well aware of there being many british people involved but we are sadly stuck with them while at least if some are foreign they can go home; we have more than enough to deal with!)
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.1
I wrote on my Tumblr what I think the cause of the Riots was
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.2
I’m making this blog because I didn’t feel that long blocks of text and my thoughts and feelings on world events is what my followers on that blog would enjoy, so that’s what this blog will be about.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.3
My first blog post being directed towards the current rioting in the UK, as you may have guessed by now.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.4
I hope to explain why I think that this is happening without simply labelling all the people involved as thugs or animals, no matter how un-necessary I feel this violence actually is.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.5
Now as most of you know what started this off is the shooting of Mark Duggan by police.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.6
The events which unfolded over last week are still very unclear but peaceful protesters took to the streets in Tottenham on Saturday to demand answers.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.7
As the night drew on without answers tension in the ‘mob’ now grew and after rumours of the beating of a 16 year old girl by police had got out the protesters had enough.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.8
The peace then turned into a larger riot with burning of various houses, we’ll get to why it went so far later.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.9
Now it’s important to note the riots of Sunday, Monday and tonight (Tuesday) had very little to do with the shooting of Mark Duggan.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.10
There are many speculations as to why these are occurring; When asked by various media sources youths gave different responses.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.11
“…the older generations don’t respect us youth so as soon as you respect us we’ll respect us back…”-BBC News “..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.12
I’m taking my taxes back..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.13
” - Mark Stone YouTube “…We’re showing the police we can do what we want… we’re also showing the rich,who’s businesses these are, that we can do what we want…” - BBC News.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.14
Now ignoring how uneducated one of those responses is it seems that the rioters believe they’re acting on some sort of social divide which has formed in the UK.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.15
The split between Adults and Teenagers and the ongoing social divide between the rich and the poor and highlighting the severity of the unequal distribution of wealth in the UK.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.16
It should have been easy to predict that the youth would show distaste towards todays government; the rise in university fees, the 75% cuts to Youth Club funding and many Arts courses being cut.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.17
The disadvantaged rightly feel that they are getting more oppurtunities taken away from them and they feel let down by the government.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.18
However that still doesn’t explain just exactly why these feelings turn into riots, looting, arson and other such outstanding acts of violence.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.19
Well I looked into the mindset behind the mob, what drives rioters… and found an extremely interesting theory of ’Deindividuation’.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.20
<a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/02/10/deindividuation/">http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/02/10/deindividuation/</a>
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.21
What this study shows is that when there are a large amount of people together and there’s a strong feeling of anonymity a hive-mind effect takes place.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.22
If the large crowd has a similar feeling; be that tension, anger, disappointment, resentment etc. and one or two members of the crowd begin to instigate these feelings each individual in the crowd begins to lose sense of who they are and what kind of individual they are.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.23
The link I posted talks about crowds telling someone to jump from a building to commit suicide and getting people in the crowd to act completely out of character.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.24
So when a large group gets together with friends and one or maybe two of the natural leaders instigate violence it can quickly turn into full fledged violence.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.25
There are also acts of conformity going into play with a lot of people giving into peer pressure to their friends.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.26
Some people aren’t as lucky as you or I and if all they have in their lives are their friends and they ask them to go cause a ****storm in the city with them they’ll most likely give in.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.27
Hopefully after reading that you’ll agree that not all of the people involved in the rioting are evil people or animals.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.28
They are simply people who share feelings of resentment towards their government and lose themselves as an individual during large crowds.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0012.29
However I do severely hope that parents prove to be good and will ensure that any items found to be looted are returned to the respective shops and that they punish their children appropriately.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0013.1
It's possible this is a false flag event.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0013.2
ie populace end up giving away more civil liberties in exchange for more government in their lives
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3809858_0013.3
Maybe, but I'm certain the whole how-the-government-and-police-handled-the-riots situation and global economy isn't what it seems.

The only conspiracy theory here, is YOU saying they got busted for growing wacky backy.

When Venice natural food market, Rawesome Foods, was raided yesterday for selling “raw” or unpasteurized milk, it was not the first time.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.3
In fact, it is hardly a lone instance of government cracking down on the sale of raw milk.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.4
Police arrested James Stewart, the owner of Rawesome Foods, and two raw milk suppliers, Sharon Ann Palmer and Eugenie Bloch of Healthy Family Farms.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.5
A year long investigation lead to the arrests.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.6
While the raid itself appears to have been pretty by-the-book, rather than a SWAT-style raid as originally reported by Natural News, the absurdity of the raid itself is not so much in its tactics but in the fact that it’s happening in the first place.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.7
Drinking raw milk carries a certain amount of risk, as do many other acts that adults are allowed to engage in, from drinking alcohol, to driving in a steel cage every morning at unbelievable speeds along with thousands of other people on busy city streets.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.8
The risks associated with raw milk are controversial, but have of course drawn the ire of regulators who have either banned the sales outright, or required a permit.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.9
California apparently does allow the sale of raw milk but requires a permit to do so.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.10
I’m not sure why James Stewart did not have a permit.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.11
It’s possible the milk in question didn’t qualify, or that he simply didn’t believe the regulations applied to his store since it is essentially a private “drop-off-point” rather than an actual grocery store.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.12
Private individuals pick up privately distributed food from local farmers.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.13
If that’s the case, apparently regulators disagreed.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.14
Obviously spending this much time and this many resources to bust people selling dairy products is silly.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.15
Making arrests, rather than simply issuing a fine for non-compliance, is silly.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.16
And yes, the fundamental issue here is the silliness of requiring permits – or making outright bans – to sell raw milk in the first place.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.17
Permits typically don’t make us any safer, and can serve crowd out competition.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.18
In this case, big dairy farms are crowding out smaller competitors.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.19
I still wonder, though, if permits were available, why didn’t Stewart just bite the bullet?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.20
It seems easier to go along with bad regulations and fight them in the court of public opinion or at the ballot box rather than simply disregard them and face another raid.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.21
Hopefully we find out more as more light is shed on all of this.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810231_0021.22
So he was too high and mighty to obey the law and didn't have a permit.

As regards marijuana, this is California vegans, so it was a reasonable assumption, especially since it's located near "medical" marijuana dispensaries.

epic post
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0022.1
I have one of my old university lecturers on Facebook, and their statuses really rile me.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0022.2
They're a militant socialist (just that would be enough to annoy me) and make several posts a day against the cuts.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0022.3
They're arguing against cutting legal aid, getting rid of final salary pensions because apparently that's too similar to the private sector, cutting sickness benefits, amongst a host of other things.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0022.4
It makes me livid.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0022.5
These things are all necessary to cut in order to rein in the excesses of a socialist government, and these people on the marches do not give a fig to the care of future generations when a catastrophe like Greece would happen in the UK because they don't want to compromise their comfortable lifestyles afforded by the taxpayer.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0022.6
Maybe some socialists can help me understand.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0022.7
Why do you not care about the future generations enough in order to compromise our lifestyle now to secure their future?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0022.8
You should be more intelligent then.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0023.1
It's somewhat about public opinion as well.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0023.2
It would be a lot easier to a few big cuts early in tenure than it would be to do many small cuts here and there throughout the entire tenure.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0023.3
In 2 years most of us would have forgotten how things were before the cuts and for the most part almost everyone would be used to things with all the cuts and maybe even see the overall benefits of it......
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0023.4
hence people feel good about the government and the Tories get elected again to power......
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0023.5
hopefully.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0023.6
It's not targeted at the poor though.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0023.7
Public spending is predominantly on the poor because that's where the money is needed, so when they cut spending back, the poor get hurt most.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0023.8
The government don't really spend on the rich.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0023.9
Fourth largest military budget in the world.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0024.8
Absolutely, I really do agree.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0024.9
The debt the coalition inherited for the Labour government is huge.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0024.10
It will take generations to pay it back.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0024.11
If it's reduced quickly, then this will make it easier for our children, grandchildren etc.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0024.12
I just hate the public sector anyway!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0025.2
Well, you may have a point.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0025.3
That said, I think scrapping so much stuff (the harriers, destroyers, Ark Royal) was a disgrace.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0025.4
It wouldn't have cost anything to just keep that stuff in storage for a few years in case we needed it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0026.1
Tony Blair's government and indeed Gordon Brown's were Labour governments.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0026.2
They were not socialists in my opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0026.3
No socialist government would have engaged in the Private Finance Initiative, kept the union laws passed by the Tories, and kept the privatised railway network.

Intelligence = right wing politics.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0028.1
I've always thought this generally about people who oppose the cuts.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0028.2
What do you suggest we do instead?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0028.3
The fact is we've borrowed and spent too much money.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0028.4
Either we have to make cuts or raise taxes, or probably both.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0028.5
Perhaps the cuts will plow our economy into the ground?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0028.6
Reducing our GDP will increase our deficit.

I don't know a single person who doesn't agree we need cuts.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0028.12
However, many leading economists have stated that cutting public spending by such a drastic amount in a short space of time may actually have an adverse effect and stagnate the economy.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0028.13
That's what people are concerned about.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0028.14
The Tories only seem to care about their decreasing the public sector ideology and seem to have little care for what the consequences for their drastic cuts of the economy are.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0028.15
pretty much this
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0029.1
Cuts are necessary, it's just a shame it has to hit the poorest people most.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0029.2
The pain could be equally shared by putting up taxes for high earners.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0029.3
looking at the way the cuts are being managed at the moment, WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT ALL IN THIS TOGETHER!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0029.4
If you do that, you'll just make the rich go elsewhere which doesn't help the situation at all.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.1
hmm, I'm not sure how.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.2
Spending only increased pretty much bang on when the ressession started.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.3
tbh, I'm not sure why the spending increased so dramatically in 2008.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.4
It was all going fine until then.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.5
I guess it was the prices of stuff increasing/spending to try to prevent the ressession causing too much damage.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.6
I see little change in policy over those few years to warrant such an increase.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.7
Maybe someone who knows a little about economics can tell me why
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.10
+ as far as I can tell spending hasn't actually decreased a whole lot under the conservatives...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.11
I'm getting very annoyed with some of the strike stuff going on.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.12
Something about pilots striking because they only got a pay rise of 4%, wtf?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.13
Train drivers get paid a lot of money, yet strike seemingly every other day.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.14
Everyone is going to take a hit in a goddamn ressession, make do with your quite good outcomes and stop faffing around with stupid strikes.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.15
Strike when you damn well need to, at some point someone is going to strike for a damn good reason and it'll just "be another strike" and get ignored.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.16
Spending was all ready too high by then, during the height of boom times the Labour government was still running at a massive deficit which is frnakly, idiotic.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0043.17
That was the problem, spending is gradually being cut, but you can see the resistance being felt
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0044.5
Given that they're socialists they'll probably say to tax the rich even more.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0044.6
They're like a never ending pot of free money in the eyes of socialists.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0045.6
In the height of boom, 2007-2008 this graph shows the spending and revenue close.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0045.7

bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0045.9
Its hard finding decent graphs of the deficit...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0045.10

bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0045.11

bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0048.1
The cuts are not being thought through.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0048.2
Let's look at what's happening to teachers - being made to work longer and pay more for a lower pension.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0048.3
Look closer and realise that forcing teachers to work longer will raise the average age of the teaching community and will therefore mean the government is paying more in teacher salary than before.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0048.4
It also means that for every teacher who will now stay on when they wouldn't have before, there will be a teacher that has been trained with government money who will not get a job.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0048.5
This person will either claim welfare or will claim a job that previously someone else would have had - the latter person will therefore now claim welfare.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0048.6
Overall, this huge hammer to teachers will probably not save much money at all.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810718_0048.7

The price increase?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0024.5

This is going to be an increasing problem as drugs companies like Astra Zeneca switch from all encompassing mildly effective drugs to drugs that are specific to a small number of cases: thus increasing the cost.

Personally I believe it is as much a crime to allow your children to become obese from overfeeding then allowing them to become malnourished through under feeding and think the Child Protection Agency should take the same stance, it is just unfair on the Children to be subjected to the far reaching Physical and Mental disadvantages that can result from Childhood Obesity.

However I digress and that is another matter.

Furthermore the state of A&E on a Friday and Saturday night is disgusting.

Now I drink, quite heavily often but I still believe the current system is a joke and unjust.

Vital services to accidents are greatly put under strain by the ambulances and stomach pumps etc. put to inebriated people.

There needs to be a disincentive such as a £50 surcharge for using A&E under your own fault under Alcohol related causes and I myself would be happy to pay this.

Similar things are true for smokers than with obesity but I think you get my issue and this is dragging on.

TLDR: Essentially people who knowingly abuse there body should no longer divert NHS budget from those suffering from ailments beyond there control as it just isn't sustainable and is not fair and gives no incentive to look after your health.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0025.24
I completely agree, it often does favour those who don't deserve it.

And yet, someone who is overweight and cant be ****ed to exercise and eat less can get a gastric band fitted for thousands.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0025.29
Altho, I am sympathetic to those who are overweight cos of illness or whatever.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.1
The point of healthcare is that it's universal.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.2
As far as possible, doctors avoid judging and imposing decisions on patients because that's not their job- their job is to treat.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.3
The role of the NHS in determining who is "deserving" stems from, and only from, the principle of justice (i.e. deciding how to fairly split funding and medical practitioners' time so on).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.4
So it's not that the obese are getting an advantage over cancer sufferers in some discriminatory way, it's got more to do with cost.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.5
That's an important distinction in emotive language.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.6
Also, according to Embarrassing Fat Bodies, there were 7,000 gastric bypasses last year.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.7
Given the stats for obesity (1/4 of British adults are obese), that's hardly excessive.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.8
How would you propose that we stop treating obese people?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.9
If someone collapses, do paramedics look at them, think "oh, they have quite a belly, can't be helping them" and leave them to die?

If an obese person has a prolapse (which can be caused by obesity, but can also be caused by childbirth) do they get treated for that (you can't pinpoint obesity as the cause) or not?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.11
And if the implication is that someone shouldn't be treated for something self-inflicted, does that mean there shouldn't be STD treatment for those who had unprotected sex?

What about treatment for vegetarian anemics?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.13
The list is endless.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.14
Genetics can put you at risk of obesity (leptin (hormone which regulates appetite) deficiency, overactive thyroid, certain alleles of the FTO gene can highly increase risk of obesity).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.15
Even environmental causes like bullying can lead to obesity, and frankly, refusing to treat someone from something which is the product of their genetic make up and environment seems to me unfair.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.16
There's a massive problem with obesity, and the NHS's prevention schemes haven't worked.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.17
It's a problem that needs to be tackled, but refusing treatment to people will make nay difference- the number of shows on TV about the risks of obesity is actually unreal, and yet our nation carries out getting fatter- not many people look far enough in the future to realise damage they're doing to their bodies.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.18
Yes it would be fiendishly difficult neigh on impossible to implement.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.19
I have no diea how the situation would be carried about.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.20
Really I'm just highlighting an injustice.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.21
My mum works at a private hospital as a physio were the NHS outsource bariatric patients from Liverpool Hospital and they have seen an increase in Gastric patients each year she has worked there for the past 3 years, so it's becoming an increasing issue.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.22
Rejection of treatment is obviously the wrong way to go about it, but would you not agree the system in it's current state does nothing to dis-inventivise unhealthy living.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0038.23
According to my mother the NHS guidelines, albeit for the physio aftercare, is just a short talk about healthy living.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0039.1
I am fat and have never needed serious medical treatment, go to doctors about once a year(for depression) and I dont smoke or drink so am otherwise healthy.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0039.2
Then you are not the problem, it is a reasonably small minority at the absolute extreme of the spectrum that are the issue.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0040.7
I don't disagree that it's a problem, I just think that the suggestion that they shouldn't get treatment is plain outlandish (even if you didn't suggest that, other people have).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0040.8
Mm, it's not like there aren't schemes for healthy eating and dietitians on the NHS though.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0040.9
To tackle obesity attitudes need to change but how to get that to happen, I don't know.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0040.10
Hopefully the work that's going on in schools now will have a positive impact on the future

AND....

not only does it make financial sense but practical sense.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0041.3
I had a patient a few weeks ago who was around 35-40stone and she was so big we had to specially order in a bariatric hoist and sling from a hospital over in birmingham as they were too big to move or do anything with.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0041.4
We couldn't even was her, toilet her, dress her without effort- and ended up becoming an 8 person job and doing a lot of 'unoffical' damage to our own backs.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0041.5
Now i'd much rather be caring for less people like this DUE to the fact they were recieving gastric bands, than the NHS forking out on speciality equipment....
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0041.6
It's awful isn't it?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0041.7
I dread caring for really huge patients as it's just impossible to do.

Hospitals would be pretty much empty if anyone who had made any contribution to their illness was turfed out.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0066.1
The NHS should be abolished in its entirety.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0067.1
I can see the benefits of this, but there was a scandal where obese children were taken away from their parents and then it turned out that the kids all had an illness that made them obese.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0067.2
There's a massive risk with taking away children from their families because of the devastating effect it has on families (look up Munchausen by Proxy if you're interested.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0067.3
There was an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA54k6a81-c">interesting documentary</a> about it recently).

If you get it wrong then that's 4/5 people's lives ruined.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0067.5
Also, you're right that how you live as a child has an effect of what you're like as an adult, but I'm not sure if living in care provides a much more stable home.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0067.6
Growing up in care is really, really hard and that itself can cause mental health problems and/or comfort eating.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0067.7
It seems like you can't win either way.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0067.9
You could argue much the same for the child taken from it's parents for malnourishment though surely it affects the lives of all involved, it's the parents fault for subjecting them to child abuse.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0067.10
Obviously the child would ave to be first screened more genetic pre-dispositions and the parents given fair chance to intervene, but I think it would send a clear message that grossly over-feeding your child is abuse.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0067.11
It would be a very difficult and controversial measure to carry out however.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811045_0067.12

I bought their book as I was intrigued to understand the whole thing more, and to give something towards the search for her.

But I am literally shocked with what I'm reading.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.4
- In the beginning, loads of shrinks/psychics were sending in information about visions they had had where they thought she was.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.5
They used up time and resources and money actually following up some of these.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.6
- they actually paid for a man who claimed he had a machine which could track madeleine down, to come out to portugal and find her.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.7
The machine included putting some of her DNA (hair and eyelashes) into a machine and she would be located by GPS. And they actually believed it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.8
Another couple of things I just found really weird is that when they left their kids in the apartment, they left the door open, the patio open, the blinds open, it was on a corner with roads directly next to two sides of it, it was on a ground level, with no barriers or anything around it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.9
As a parent, if you looked at that apartment, what the heck would make you think that's safe ?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.10
Why would you leave your young kids in somewhere like that?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.11
Yes they were only a few yards away but one look away and it's enough time for some local to move his way in.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.12
-they travelled extensively all over the world leaving their twins behind.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.13
I don't understand how if they lost one kid, how could they leave the other two behind all the time?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.14
Yes with trusted people, but my maternal instinct would be in overdrive and I wouldnt want them out of my sight.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.15
This is exactly why there was so much controversy when the case first broke, people recognised that their behaviour was unusual for somebody who had lost a child.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.16
Maybe they are just odd people, but it didn't ring right.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.17
Exactly the same happened to Joanne Lees in the Peter Falconio case, she was the girl who's boyfriend was murdered in the outback in Australia, and it came out that she was cheating on him with another guy at the time he was murdered, and then sold her story for many thousands of pounds....
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.18
people judged her as being a bit odd.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.19
And now you have got the business going on with Shrien Dewani about the murder of his wife, when all sorts of other murky facts are appearing about their circumstances at the time, so people suspect him.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0016.20
I am not judging the McCanns and Kate McCann does look like a woman who is sufficiently traumatised to be genuine, but I think they did some odd things at the time, both before her disappearance and just after it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0017.1
They gave money to a man who claimed he could track her down by using her eyelashes to get a GPS lock on her?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0017.3
And these people are doctors?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811584_0017.5

Bin Laden is dead.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.2
That's perhaps..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.3
the best news many of us have heard in the last decade.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.4
But, doesn't the whole affair seem a bit odd?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.5
I mean..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.6
I don't know..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.7
but the timing for one (just before Obama's re-election campaign).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.8
Then there's the fact of there being no footage and the body being buried at sea.

When the United States captured Saddam Hussein..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.10
his pictures were all over the news..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.11
wouldn't it make sense to at least release one proper picture of Bin Laden too to silence all the critics?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.12
Also, ASSUMING the whole thing is a sham..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.13
it isn't too difficult to photoshop a picture..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.14

I'm also a bit confused about the details of the compound where Bin Laden is said to have been residing for the past..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.19
five years?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.20
I somewhat remember hearing on the news on the first (or second) day after his death that the compound was completed in the summer of 2010.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.21
And I was reading an article in Time Magazine a few days after his death..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.22
they said that the tape that was retrieved bearing Al-Qaeda's confirmation that Bin laden was dead was found near the compound and had not been verified although it was assumed that it was in fact from Al-Qaeda.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.23
So, has Al-Qaeda stepped forward with their renowned video tapes as yet?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.24
Are there any other facts or incidents that make his death seem a bit sketchy?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.25
Or prove that it was correct except for various statements from governments etc..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.26
because I mean, being a history student..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.27
if the death was a sham, then this wouldn't be the first time governmetns have used propaganda stories for their benefit..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.28
But then again, for all we know..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.29
he could really have been killed or perhaps he's been dead for a long time but getting caught by the USA seemed a befitting way for him to die?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.30
I don't know what to make of the whole thing to be honest..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.31
I can't see his death reducing the scale of the 'War on Terror'..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.32
But I do hope that the news of his death brings some closure to the 9/11 victims..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0001.33
it's been a tough ride for them..

Sometimes I like to think that if the current generation had fought in that war, we would have lost.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0002.10
Hell, we almost lost it before we began by being too nice to the enemy.

That said, I think he is dead.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0003.1
He's swimming with the fishes
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0004.1
I'm quite surprised how quick the yanks buried him.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0004.2
I thought they should spend weeks or months examining his body.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0005.1

I think he's probably dead, but I do also think that there is a possibility that the Americans have captured him and are keeping it quiet.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0010.2
Agree.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0010.3
If indeed there wasn't a big shootout, it can't have been beyond the wit of man to capture him.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0010.4
But the nightmare scenario is having him alive and in detention, awaiting trial.

The first resort of Islamic militants is to take hostages, and they'll do that and kill untold people until the point at which Osama gets convicted and presumably executed.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811687_0010.6
And how exactly do you give Osama bin Laden a fair trial?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0161.1
It is an ill founded judgement for very obvious reasons isnt it?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0161.2
You have stated as fact that all people who hold anti immigration views prefer Americans to Poles.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0161.3
Did I get it wrong?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0161.4
Do you not credit anyone besides yourself with the ability to make rational and discerning decisions based on current economic and socio-political conditions?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0161.5
Not all, but a significant amount.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0161.6
There are people who can rationally argue an anti-immigration standpoint.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0161.7
However, the majority of people that try to do so inevitably isolate certain groups of immigrants.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0161.8
At the moment, there is a lot of hate for polish immigrants (simply look at any thread such as this one).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0161.9
Anyway, the relevant points were that immigrants do NOT get significant support from the government, they are NOT able to apply for benefits.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0161.10
This whole speech by Cameron is simply an effort to gain some short term support for the elections.

There isnt even enough jobs for British people!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0162.3
It has caused nothing but problems.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0162.6
Who accepts as little as 3 pounds per hour, not bothering to take the employer to court, when you would be complaining about not getting minimum wage?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0162.7
British employers like it when immigrants work for them as many of them don't know their rights and don't look down on any job.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.1
Hmm..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.2
I come from Blackburn, the most racially segregated place in Britain.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.3
Background on race and culture in Blackburn in case you don't know: · Spoiler: · Facts: · At the time of the 2001 census, Blackburn was 69.22% White British (national average for England 89.99%) with significant Indian (14.31%) and Pakistani (11.45%) ethnic minorities.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.4
In terms of religion, 57.53% of residents were Christian (average for England 71.74%), 25.74% Muslim (average for England 3.1%) and 15.98% no religion or not stated.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.5
My Experience: · There are, in Blackburn, "Asian areas" and "White areas".
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.6
These are quite clearly defined, with not many exceptions to the rule.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.7
The only place shared by the two groups is the commercial town centre, but all the residential areas are split into Asian and White.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.8
Most Asian kids go to Pleckgate School, and Beardwood.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.9
Some go to Witton.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.10
Most White kids go to St. Wilfrids, St. Bedes, Our Lady St. Johns, Vale or Darwen Academy.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.11
The only mixed school really is Witton Park High School.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.12
White private school girls go to Westholme, Asian private school girls go to Tauheedul-Islam Girls' High School.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.13
QEGS private school is pretty mixed race.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.14
(of course, there are exceptions, but this represents a majority) · White people use white taxis, asian people use asian taxis.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.15
People don't really mix at all.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.16
Its unusual to see a group of people who are mixed race - occasionally you have an asian kid hanging out in a white group, or a white kid in an asian group, but generally each sticks to their own race.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.17
Inter-racial dating doesn't happen very much at all.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.18
White people prefer to shop in places owned by white people, asian people prefer to shop in places owned by asian people.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.19
There is an occurrence known as "White flight" - When Asian families move into an area, there is a tendency for white people to move away.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.20
Hardly any white people hang around in the densely Asian areas - Whalley Range, Barbara Castle Way area etc, and hardly any Asians hang around in the densely White areas - Pleasington, Feniscowles, Cherry Tree, and Mill Hill especially - Mill Hill is notoriously racist, a lot of the Asian families who have lived there or set up businesses have been firebombed or bullied into leaving.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.21
Has immigration in Blackburn 'damaged communities'?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.22
I don't think so at all.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.23
Its extremely segregated, yes, and there is some hatred and ignorance on both sides, but I work all over Blackburn, including the Asian areas.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.24
Personally, I love their communities, everyone's always talking to each other, people walk into each others houses, everyone's friendly to each other and people are always out on the streets talking to or visiting neigbours.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.25
Similarly, the white communities are strong - there are a lot of charitable groups, people try and help each other out, people get to know their neighbours well.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.26
Some of the Asians, probably quite a significant number, can't speak English, and don't have any intention to.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.27
But why would they, in this area?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.28
You get the occasional person while i'm working who'll call me white scum or spit at my feet, but you get the same hostilities from a minority both ways.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.29
In the most part, Whites and Asians ignore each other's existence.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.30
Conclusion (tl;dr version) From my limited experience, which ranges Blackburn with Darwen, immigration has caused two simultaneous, strong and friendly communities.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.31
The only problem is - the communities do not interact with each other.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.32
They don't want to, and I don't think they'll be able to for a long, long time.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.33
I don't think its a bad thing.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.34
Forgive me for saying so...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.35
but I think it is a bad thing.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.36
Segregation only limits how much people can learn from each other and therefore prevents people from increasing their knowledge and bettering themselves.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0163.37
Arrogant as this may sound, I pity (all) the people of Blackburn.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0164.8
Cameron?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0164.9
Well, yeah, he'll do anything to win votes.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0164.10
We all know that but despite his speech being the cause of this thread, I think it has evolved to a point where the discussion has opened out into immigration in general.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0164.11
People are people and theres hate both ways between Poles and British etc...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0164.12
not really my point.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0164.13
On this benefits thing, what you are saying run contradictory to everything I have ever heard.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0164.14
Are you absolutely sure that immigrants cannot claim anything upon entry into this country?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0164.15
Dont get me wrong, I stand to be corrected if I havent got my facts straight.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0165.28

I think you should re-read this and tell me exactly what is good about anything you just stated.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0173.36
The idea of immigration isn't to be able to walk down the road and suddenly be in an asian "country" where people spit at you and call you white scum.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0173.37
I honestly find it despicable that you could come to another country to live and then call the nationals scum.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811743_0174.5
Well, don't worry mate, it's only Britain where it is allowed......

Ohhhh sh**
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0001.1
When I went to vote today I ended up having a rather heated discussion with the 'yes party' campaigners that were standing outside the door of the polling station.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0001.2
At one point they also walked up and down the student flats in the area approaching any students that came out the door.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0001.3
What annoyed me the most about these campaigners was the EXTREMELY aggressive approach they were taking.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0001.4
One girl had a mega phone and was shouting things like 'If you vote no the BNP will get in' etc. I watched her approach a group of students who said they didn't really know anything about the two voting systems and she then proceeded to give them a very biased overview.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0001.5
There were no representatives from the 'no party'.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0001.6
From my point of view, this was extremely unfair as it didn't give students the chance to make an educated judgement.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0001.7
Surely this kind of aggressive campaign is completely unethical?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0001.8
From what I could see they were trying to convince the students who had less knowledge about the new voting system into voting for them.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0001.9
I was going to vote yes but I was so appalled by the parties' representatives at the polling station that I decided not to vote at all.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0001.10
IMO it is completely unethical, especially for a party who claims they are campaigning for a 'fairer voting system' to attempt to pressure passers by into voting for them.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0001.11
Especially since they were stood right outside the polling station and the aggressive approach this one girl was taking was rather intimidating.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0001.12
I'm all for campaigning but I think that this was really a step too far.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0001.13

bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0003.2

ok how so?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0004.4
her response pissed me off so much "because the lib dems could get in", · i asked what makes her think that and she said they would get around the same amount of seats as labour or conservative...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0004.5
ok so your voting yes so we can have more hung parliaments?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0004.6
her response was just, no because one party needs 50% of the seats to lead so hung parliaments can't happen as the 2nd nd 3rd preference votes are used for this
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0004.8
i should probably note that i study politics and my lecturer had told us how hed trapped a campaigner into admitting how little they knew so i wanted a go :P
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0004.9
uni campuses, especially Halls should ban these people
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811758_0005.3
So you completely disregarded your views on the policy and whether or not you wanted to change the way government is elected for at least a generation, and instead decided not to vote because a group of idiots annoyed you a bit?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0183.1
Quite right!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0183.2

What these Trotskyists don't understand is that giving young people the chance to gain skills and experience that will benefit them and us as a society isn't oppression but common sense and doing them a favour.

It certainly wasn't from the attitude of lazy entitlement that they promote.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0183.10
It was bloody hard work and working for free to gain experience is a good thing.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0183.11
Anyway they aren't working for free as they are being paid benefits!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0183.12
They have no alternative suggestions to improve things; just block any sensible attempt to sort out the problem and continue scraping along at the bottom with the current failling status quo.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0183.13
So should people who've been out of work for years (some families have 3 generations where they have NEVER worked!) continue living off the backs of those who pay for their benefits without any obligation to offer anything in return?!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0183.14
That's morally right is it?!

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0184.1
The opening statement you quoted is a fact I'm afraid.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0184.2
It's all very well dismissing statements as discriminatory if they are wildly inaccurate but it kind of defeats your point if it is true!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0184.3
you're joking of course.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0184.4
i mean, i know you probably are, but sometimes you have to proclaim it because there really are people that one-dimensional out there!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0185.1
As for "I think I speak for the vast majority when I say we don't want your discriminating kind here".
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0185.2
What is this the 50's?!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0185.3
All you've done is copied what I've said because my thinking was sharper, and it doesn't even make sense the way you've used it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189430_0185.4
I know what you're trying to do, but you should aim it at someone who takes the bait.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0014.1
Lets face it, they're just a bunch of racist, right wing extremists.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0014.2
Doesn't matter what they say.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0014.3
So because of that, which is true, any point they raise must be ignored and sectioned from society.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0014.4
That is quite a good example of fascism, ironically.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0014.5
Are you a member of the UAF?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0014.6
The original EDL weren't racist and weren't opposed by the mainstream of even the left (guardian were indifferent) they were opposed to Special interests and positive discrimination via extreme muslims.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0014.7
Then the Nazi's f***** it all up and destroyed their legitimacy in the lefts eyes, so now they can't be take seriously.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0014.8
Urgh.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0014.9
I personally hate Noam Chomsky and think his ideas would be very dangerous and lead to lots of unrest but I listen to, appreciate and respect them.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0014.10
And other point he raises are spot on and I incorporate them into some of my views.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0014.11
The far-left can never do that, nor the authoritarian right (I'm avoiding far-right because the EDL are not far-right by true, economic definition)
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0015.1
Whats an EDL haha?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0016.5
I'm not a member of the UAF, no.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0016.6
Check my sig for political views/membership.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0016.7
Racism and violence obviously has no place in modern society, which is why the EDL should be ignored.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0016.8
If they drop these policies, then of course they should be listened to.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0016.9
While I do believe that Islam should be contained in an effort to protect British national identity.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0016.10
I do not believe in the violent, racist ways the EDL go about it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0016.11
I think it should be done in peaceful ways, such as stricter immigration/culture laws.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.1
The big problem with liberals is they are a bunch of upper-class/middle class tits pretending to be working class and pretending to have working class problems from the comfort of their countryside village who then, automatically dismiss any working class man who criticises immigration as a "fascist" and a "Nazi" and refuses to see a different between a true Nazi (like the nutters who support C18) and people merely opposed to mass-immigration.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.2
It doesn't only extend to immigration.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.3
See the Dale Farm evictions, the travellers had a lot of support from middle-class twits who came down to support "the oppressed minority" and boost their own sense of self-worth without considering at all the thoughts and feelings of the locals who have had to put up with an illegal travellers site for over ten years and the crime and problems that it would bring.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.4
They only see one side of the argument because of their sheep mentality and lack the mental apptitude to see the bigger picture.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.5
There's also a problem with liberals flat out refusing to report on anti-white racism.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.6
They're quick to cry out if any minority is on the recieving end of an attack, prejudice or violence yet make every excuse under the sun when a white Englishman/woman is the victim.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.7
Take the recent Leicester attack where Liberal groups were defending the four Somali women by saying it wasn't racist and that the lady who was attacked husband used 'unneccesary force' in protecting her.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.8
If, they were less biased and actually opposed all types of racism rather than just racism by whites then honestly, groups like the EDL would not have grown as large as they did.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.9
Personally, I am not opposed to immigration but it should be skilled workers only.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.10
No problem at all with having Indian lawyers, doctors, accountants etc coming to the country and improving it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.11
What I do have a problem is giving a passport to any unqualified person with very few skills or qualifications when we have plenty of people who can do the grunt work anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.12
Do we really need to allow a bunch of warehouse labourers and factory workers into the country when there's plenty of unemployed already who can do the job?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.13
Yet, anybody who has an argument against mass-immigration is immediately shouted down by the left and the liberals as a "racist" and a "Nazi" who flat out refuse to listen to opposing arguments.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.14
Another thing, the liberals and supposed "Anti-fascist" groups seem to verge onto fascist territory themselves at times.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.15
We live in a democracy, a place where freedom of speech exists and where people should not be targetted because of their race, cultural or political beliefs and yet, those on the left are constantly involved in attacks on supporters of right-wing groups.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.16
Nick Griffin has been attacked and had a dart thrown at him.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.17
BNP members have been forced out of their jobs by "liberals" and anti-racist groups.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.18
Now, regardless of whether you agree with their policies and ideas, is it right that men should be attacked and forced out of work because of their beliefs?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.19
Isn't attacks on political opponents and denying them the right to freedom of speech a traditionally fascist method?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.20
I don't support the BNP at all (I vote Conservative) but I do believe that Nick Griffin should be allowed to be a politician and give speeches without fear of reprisal.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.21
Likewise, I believe Anjem Choudary and his group should also be allowed to say what they want without fear of reprisal.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0017.22
Excellent post sir, I'd plus rep you if I could
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0040.1
Maybe when they stop using terms like nazi/fascist to decribe people opposed to immigration.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0040.2
Your post makes no sense.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0040.3
Liberals by definition are opposed to government engineered immigration, in fact liberals are opposed to most aspects of government policy all together.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0040.4
'Liberal' socialism has nothing to do with liberals at all.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0040.5
The terminology has been hijacked
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0041.5
Although its difficult to call them socialist when many of them are pro-capitalism.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0041.6
Cultural marxists is probably the most acurate description.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0041.7
True Liberals often refer to themselves as libertarians so the term liberal is now widely applied to cultural marxists despite the fact they are nothing to do with oldschool liberals.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0042.4
I still regard myself as a liberal.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0042.5
You can have capitalist socialism, it's just focussed on state control and redistribution of capital.

Looks like someone can't take the truth about the EDL
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0043.6
No we should just attempt to fit all 7 billion people in the UK and then boast about being the only country to allow mass immigration and nobody's listening because nobody cares and it's a stupid idea.

If anyone has a problem with the EDL, the things they do, they way they do it, or even just the fact that some shops are closed on the days of the protests, then you can thank the liberal governments we've had over the past 50 years.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0045.2
If the government since the 1950's hadn't allowed mass immigration groups like the EDL/NWI wouldn't exist.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0045.3
groups like the EDL are something specific to multi-cultural nations, it's part of the multi-cultural package.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0045.4
People have got to understand that you can't have this nice fluffy utopia and not have the popular backlash.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0045.5
So if anyone has a problem with any anti multi-cultural organisations, you can blame the progressive/liveral governments from the apst 50 years.

What a load of crap.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0045.7
You reckon that anti-immigration parties wouldn't course trouble if we decided to ban/massively reduce immigration, well that's a good plan, why don't we convert to communism at the same time so left-wing protests don't effect you so badly.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0045.8
You can't ever please everyone, the EDL is a (very) small group of morons, and the problem if anything is not liberalism or pro-immigration policies but people like Cameron feeding their fire telling everyone that multiculturalism has failed just before a major EDL demo.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0046.1
Liberals have a lot to answer for.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0046.2
I use the term 'liberal' as a slur precisely because of things like this.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0046.3
I also use the term liberal as a slur.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0046.4
It was one a noble idea in the days of slavery and empire but now it is a financially and intellectually bankrupt set of ideas which is alligned to global communism i.e. Free borders, let all our comerads in, bankrupt the nation if thats what it takes to give people what we think they need.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0046.5
And the idea of the nation state itself is seen as irrelevant and not worth saving etc.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0047.4
Yep, these ideologues are only liberal when they're spending everyone else's money.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0047.5
And then they expect to be congratulated for their public displays of selflessness and compassion!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0048.1
Rubbish, somebody that argued against British Imperialism and fought for colonial independence = a left wing hero, when British people stand up for exactly the same values in their own country they're written off by the left as "right-wing hardliners."

Except the EDL leadership have stated in interviews that they have no problem with other races or peoples coming into the UK- they have a problem with Islam or at least, 'radical' Islam.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0050.2
Now bear in mind the EDL formed after the whole Luton army march thing, which was of course a direct product of the state choosing to go to War in Iraq and Afghanistan- a group decided to protest against the soldiers and the state as an extension of this- something the EDL opposed because, rightly, soldiers shouldn't be shouted down for basically doing their jobs- or, if they should- then so should basically every public sector worker.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0050.3
The EDL was designed to effectively counter Muslim demonstrations against the British Army- which has little to do with liberalism, or liberal political economy- rather, it has more to do with politics.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0050.4
This is especially prevalent considering the EDL's inherent hatred of the left- who are usually anti-state, anti- military industrial complex and certainly anti-liberal (in a political sense).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0050.5
Secondly, the term 'multiculturalism' is a ridiculous phrase, that has been abused by politicans who are apparently proponents of it, and the media who use it to dehumanise particular groups at the extent of others.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0050.6
Cultures are not defined by race- they tend to be more defined by class.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0050.7
So in that respect, the existence of different cultures inherently exists in any major town or city in the world- even if the majority of people are from the same ethnic background.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0050.8
You only have to look in particular areas of Russia (Moscow/ St Petersburg) or even Japan to see that different cultures exist in the same geographical location despite little to no immigration.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0050.9
The result is that multiculturalism in its purest sense must exist in a society that promotes free markets (which is thus related to Capitalism as a political model- something the EDL has little problem with).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0050.10
The truth is that the EDL has no idea what it actually stands for.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0050.11
It itself is a group that is heavily divided in potholes of racists, classists, people who are genuinely against radical islam and people who just want to have a laugh on saturdays.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0050.12
As a result, it is basically like any other social movement that loses its organic base- it eventually depletes into nothing while trying to justify its existence.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0050.13
tl;dr- the EDL does not exist as a symptom of liberalism or liberal political economy.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0050.14
Agreed with most of this.

Any policy that is pro-multiculturalism is also inherently biased against the indigenous population, the liberal elites -and God knows why- feel embarrassed by our predominantly-white relatively successful history so decided to punish us with unlimited third world immigration.

No you're wrong about immigration.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0056.6
Liberals would be opposed to border controls as immigration policy itself, i.e. hand-picking who enters/leaves the country is social engineering.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189448_0056.7
The only form of restriction liberals would favour is limiting those who are a threat to people's safety, so a diseased person or a violent criminal.

He started arguing the usual 'If we didn't have this then there would be discrimination against women, women getting paid less, and discrimination against minorities.

' I said that it has gone too far and that we now have an "immigration welfare industrial complex" where not only import people who go on benefits but import people who fill jobs that could be done by Brits who either want job or chose not to work because we give up to 26k in benefits.

At that point the hard red leftist guy was speechless and I lectured him "Thatcher said that the people who pushed liberal ideologies that perpetuated Britain's decline were 'Wets'", and you seem to have been brainwashed by your communist masters through the TV, at which point he withdrew from the discussion.

Racism is a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races determine cultural or individual achievement, usually involving the idea that one's own race is superior and has the right to rule others.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189512_0050.3
This is evident in all groups, cultures and races throughout the globe.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189512_0050.14
The EDL are indeed violent and their popularity helped by media images of Islamic fundamentalists protesting against soldiers returning from service in Afghanistan and Iraq, which in a country with a strong military history and history of pride in the Armed Forces was bound to inflame a disenchanted, unemployed and in many instances poorly educated youth.

A conversation with a liberal...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189512_0253.3
Something rather strange happened last night.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189512_0253.4
Firstly, i was in a pub, which is in itself unusual.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189512_0253.5
Secondly, i found myself in conversation with some rather earnest liberal types.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189512_0253.6
The conversation turned to politics, which led eventually to a rather silly looking woman (RSLW) saying that she hated the BNP.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189512_0253.7
Voice of reason (VOR): Really why is that?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189512_0253.8
RSLW: Because they are horrible, fascist skin head brutes.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189512_0253.13
RSLW: No, certainly not.

But i am aware of the 52 people murdered in the name of Islam in London in 2005, and the 2,973 murdered in the name of Islam in America on 9/11, and over 1,000,000 murdered in the name of Islam in the Sudan.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189512_0253.18

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189512_0253.19
Are you prepared to admit therefore that Islam is a murderous religion?

Even though you cannot name a single murder carried out in their name?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189512_0253.24

On one hand we have followers of a religion called Islam, who murder us in the name of that religion and inform us that their ultimate ambition is to conquer us, whilst on the other hand we have a group of people who have murdered no one, and who wish to defend the country, yet you think that the BNP is filled with murderous haters and that Islam is a religion of peace?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189512_0253.35

I see so, rather than get the British chav people back to work and develop British manufacturing so we a. solve our balance of payments/ debt problems and and stop making China current account deficits year after year and b. solve social problems by turning the welfare hellholes with drug dealing, knife & drug crime back into productive places where people have jobs (which they once were before cultural marxism introduced benefits currently at £2,000 per month), instead of importing labour so the state pays for a Brit to do nothing, and subsidises a foreigner who is low paid.

For example one thing I proposed to Iain Duncan Smith was Export Processing Zones, i.e. taking away benefits and giving them the option to work assembling goods for Reebok, Nike or Dell, and this would be subsidised by the State for the benefit of reviving Britain’s manufacturing industry and improving the trade deficits/ debt situation.

If they really want freedom and democracy, then they should recognise that as part of democracy, you get freedom of religion and from religion ie: you don't have to belong to any religion, but you are also allowed to practise your religion and by practising, it does mean putting religious buildings up

how can you afford half a trillion to give to banks but cant fund education.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189782_0054.2
We can't afford to do that, but if its that (even though £500bn is a number you've just made up), but the alternative of sending RBS, HBOS, B&B and Northern Rock account holders to the wall (ignoring any possible contagion) then there wasn't all that much choice of politicians.

'Is the new tuition fee fairer?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189782_0056.3
Most people seem to be arguing about whether the graduates themselves are better or worse off under this system than the previous, which is a whole different question.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189782_0056.4
In terms of this issue, almost all graduates will pay less for their degrees under this new system than under the previous system.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189782_0056.5
It is that simple.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189782_0056.6
In terms of fairness, as less of the cost of the degrees will be payed by graduates, there will be a higher cost to the taxpayer which, as this group doesn't only include graduates, means more of the cost will be paid by those who do not have degrees (tending on average to be the poorer parts of the society) than under the previous system.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189782_0056.7
In this regard it is clearly less fair for precisely the same reason that it makes graduates better off.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189782_0056.8
People are also arguing about the way education is payed for more generally and not just in terms of comparing this system and the previous system.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189782_0056.9
Now, when it comes to the state (or really the public) paying for a degree in whole or in part, the question here is whether people think that for some reason students, who nearly all seem to come from middle class or upper class backgrounds, deserve to have their education payed for in part by taxing those people who are poorer than they are, and who didn't themselves get to go to university ( and with regards to the issue of access for those who are from poorer sections of society, the issue isn't really the cost of the degrees, but the fact that many people in poorer areas are failed terribly by the education system earlier on ).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189782_0056.10
Often enough you hear people saying that everyone should contribute towards people going to university because of the economic benefits brought to the whole country by having a better educated population - similarly I may argue that if I had a house it would benefit my neighbours if I had it improved (maybe repainted, something added to it, a professional garderner or something) as it would help to improve the neighbourhood and could even improve the value of neighbouring houses, but it would be ridiculous to suggest that my neighbours should therefore contribute to my costs in doing this.

Re the bit in bold,
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189782_0056.12
* Prior to 1997, university education was free, therefore people like the current policy makers and the previous generation got it for free, with no debt/tax system for the rest of their working life · * in other developed countires in the world, university is either free or relatively low cost (I personally dont think university should be free, it should have a cost, but £9000 per year is absolutley disgraceful)

The reason England won't let go of Scotland is purely financial.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189799_0004.2
- In 2008 London took £12.9 billion from Scotland in oil and gas revenues.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189799_0004.3
- 15% of oil and gas revenues of the Scottish sector of the North Sea which was previously attributed to the Scottish economy, £2.2 Billion in 2008, is now being attributed to the English economy.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189799_0004.4
This amount of money is more than the proposed public sector cuts per year as experts forecast that Westminster will after the Holyrood elections, cut the Scottish budget by £35 Billion over the next 15 years which equate to £2.16 Billion per year.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189799_0004.5
Scotland will give London a minimum of £225 billion over the next 15 years in oil and gas revenues alone.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189799_0004.6
- Scotland is the World's leading producer of wind energy, this energy will bring in more revenue and development opportunities than oil and gas.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189799_0004.7
- Scotland could build 2 High Schools or 16 wind turbines or 300 stream turbines or 256 two bedroom houses with a single day's Scottish Oil revenue, if the Scot's did not give it ALL TO LONDON.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189799_0004.8
- Scotland gets NO Oil Revenues - Scotland is funded only by some population taxes.

Scotland gets a central grant for the UK treasury.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189799_0009.3
The UK treasury is funded by oil, amongst various other sources of taxation.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189799_0009.4

Independence would not be a magic fix to recession.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189840_0118.3
What it would do is provide the Welsh Government of the day with all the tools to get Wales out of recession.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189840_0118.4
Wales has been in permanent recession, relative to the rest of the UK, for two decades.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189840_0118.5
GVA per capita in Wales has fallen from 84% of the UK average in 1995 to 74% today, the lowest in the UK.

Evidently something is not right with the Welsh economy.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189840_0118.7
I would lay the blame at the door of the economics promoted by elected politicians of every colour at Westminster since Thatcher; the promotion of the City of London before all else, the consequential neglect of sectors on which Wales relies, like manufacturing, and the neglect of infrastructure in the peripheral regions of the UK.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189840_0118.8

The only way out of this rut that Wales is in that I can see is to have a government in Cardiff with the will and the means to level the playing field in Britain, be that through lowering corporation tax, investing in infrastructure, doing everything it can to build up the manufacturing sector once more, or, preferably, all three at once.

Long story short, Westminster isn't interesting in fixing the Welsh economy.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189840_0118.12
Wales is underfunded in relation to the English regions.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189840_0118.13
The cross-party <a href="http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/firstminister/2010/100706holtham/?lang=en">Holtham Commission</a> , which was set up to review the funding of the Welsh Government, <a href="http://wales.gov.uk/docs/icffw/report/100705fundingsettlementsumen.pdf">suggested the replacement of the Barnett Formula</a> , a blunt instrument which apportions finance on the basis of population alone, to a needs-based formula where central government takes into account the relative deprivation of each nation and region.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189840_0118.14
This already happens in England; were it to be applied to the devolved nations as well, the Welsh Government would receive more money, and the Scottish Government less.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189840_0118.15
Hence the argument that Wales is underfunded; if a fair funding formula were instituted, Wales would receive somewhere in the region of £300 million more per year.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189840_0118.16
Believe it or not, England isn't the only place where the Barnett Formula is scorned.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189840_0118.17
All arguments come down to 'wah, wah, London isn't paying us enough attention, wah, wah'.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189840_0118.18
You have a Welsh Parliament who could have done just that.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189840_0118.19
Stop blaming for English for that fact Wales has done comparatively badly - your country has failed to get foreign investment, it depends upon manufacturing which is right now being hit very hard; it's not the fault of the English.

London doesn't suck money out of Wales; it subsidises it.

It hits national pride hard to admit you're pretty much an economic irrelevance and you have little potential especially given a big nationwide recession, so you find a common enemy in the English.

I have to say the vast majority of Welsh people don't, but you get some bitter people who have their whole world view based on this particular scenario; the Welsh vs the English and is a massively flawed and oversimplified way of looking at things.

I was saying that they are the two main areas that impact our lives, and therefore there is a difference between the two parties because one of them strives to protect it/invest in it and the other strives to strip it back to square 1. The deficit is a result of borrowing to save the collapse of the banking system, NOT because Labour invested too much money into our services.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189851_0211.4
They were able to enter the coalition essentially thanks to a combination of a tory-biased media campaign and the tele debates which Cameron and Clegg lied through their teeth in. Not many anticipated us to to be living in this depressing Britain full of deep unnecessary cuts which have made no difference to lessening the deficit (infact Osbourne's borrowing figures have rocketed of late with the thousands of unemployed needing welfare, with no jobs to put them into because they've all been cut), triple tuition fees, through the roof unemployment, a Europe that hates us, strikes, riots etc

2) It is accessible to everyone provided they work hard enough.

Now that they are gone you see no trace of them aside from the vast improvements in technology, infrastructure, health care etc. afforded to ex-colonies.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0119.3
Prior to the colonial period or expansion into the Americas gene flow tended to be extremely slow, spread over thousands of years.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0119.4
Nothing like transplanting the population from another continent half way across the world by the millions within the space of 10 years.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0120.5
The point is, they had no right to colonise anyone.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0121.2
This seems to come up a lot as well, as a matter fo fact countries were better off under British rule..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0121.3
bring British ideas and industry to places of no hope.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0121.4
Zimbabwe used to be stable until the Brits left and Mugabe went mental and started killing and exiling the minority white people as some sort of 'get back' plan.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0121.5
Zimbabwe since then is a right dump going no where.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0121.6
Also i dont see thre being white majority groups in those countries, if anything they are getting smaller.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0121.7
There was no mass immigration to India for example.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.1
I believe these rows will just keep getting worse for years to come.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.2
Problem I see is not the color of people that live in here and not from where they come.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.3
But that when someone who is not from here decides to reside in Britain, they do not adapt to Britain, they want Britain to adapt to them.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.4
I do feel unpleasant about these statistics of white race extinction, it's basically telling us that within next centuries we'll be minority in countries that were once ours?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.5
countries that will be ruled by few or more generation old foreigners that didn't really have to change anything to adapt and be somewhat British.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.6
Another issue is how on earth is it going to be with language, imagine the pot of cultures and nationalities in this country that's going to grow, it's a fact that a very mere number of foreigners can actually speak excellent English, there's a lot with bad accents from other parts of world, not everybody even knows how to call some things.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.7
Funny thing is that even some British don't have superb English.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.8
Anyway this is just vision of language nightmare.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.9
Main issue I see is identity.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.10
Would this country really have a point anymore, if minority think of themselves as British.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.11
another part is thinking their British when actually they are just 2nd generation immigrants..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.12
Maybe European countries will just merge into something new, where white people are minority, nationality is just something from history book and we're just big mixed up culture of people, creating some sort of new culture with ingredients from all parts of world.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.13
I guess that's the most probable future.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.14
surely this change is inevitable....
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0122.15
it has been the case throughout history....
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0123.7
What about the fact that many of these colonies had men fight for Britain during wars?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0123.8
They put their lives on the line for this country and what now you're saying that they don't have as much right to be here as you because you are paler?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0123.11
Anyway, I am going to sleep, so goodnight.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0123.12
I'll reply another time.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0123.13
Oh yeah, they colonised us, so why can't we colonise them?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0123.14
hmmmm good question that init?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0123.15
lol.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0123.16
ps. we are not trying to colonise you hahha.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.1

"if everyone was the same it would be boring"
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.3

It's brainwashing at it's finest, every race has a right to exist, the planet is diverse enough.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.8
It's true what people say, if you want different cultures then go visit them.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.9
This is England, we are a 3rd world dumping ground for some reason..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.10
being forced on the native populace, we don't want 200 nationalities here...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.11
is it so wrong keeping Britain white?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.12
after all the whites have occupied this land sicne the dawn of man.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.13
You have been brainwashed to believe that this country needs diversity to survive, it does not..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.14
it didnt need it in the past and it does not need it now.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.15
By the way i live in Central London...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.16
i know what im talking about.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.17
Edit: lol at neg rep, the left have really drummed in you lot well.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.18
a shame.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.19
no its not.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.20
Colonialism was forced on the native populations by the white invaders.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.21
We live in a democracy and can vote for people who represent our views.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0124.22
If people don't like something and can't live here, they know what they can do....
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0125.1
The Anglo Saxon tribes displaced and in many cases intermarried with the local populations, let alone the waves of immigration, intermarrying over the last couple of thousand years we can not positively say that we know what the genetic code of the Pictish and other pre-Roman tribes was, all we can do is make assumptions based on what we know about other races genes makeup.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0125.2
We have a good idea of native Icelandic, Scandanavian, etc genetic makeup due to the lack of immigration there, many people in the North and Nothern Isles of Scotland can trace their genetic lineage back to the Icelandic, etc countries due to this effectively untainted sample.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0125.3
Raven
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0125.4
so where does the gingerness come from?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.1
Having spent the last few hours reading this thread in its entirety, it's very clear that a lot of people feel very passionately about the subject.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.2
I am the same- so much so that I have created an account just to put a few words out there of my own.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.3
Firstly, let me establish a few things.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.4
I am white British from a long line of white British people- my genetic background isn't very diverse, I come from a very poor background- but I aspire to break out of my class with a good education.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.5
I believe that people should be allowed to love, marry or just **** whoever they like.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.6
I believe in personal freedom as much as the next person.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.7
My arguments have nothing to do with that.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.8
However, what I mean to argue is this:
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.9
Multiculturalism- an appreciation, respect and integration for all cultures, that is something to be aspired to as a nation.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.10
However- simply using such a beautiful idea as an excuse for the government to flood the country with foreigners willing to work for a disgusting wage is insulting to the idea.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.11
Mass excessive immigration is not multiculturalism.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.12
In fact not being multicultural is what most of the people on this board are worried about!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.13
It is not multicultural to replace one culture with another.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.14
It is multicultural to have a balance.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.15
What people are worried about is not that there are other cultures around us, but that- in being so eager to invite new cultures into Britain- we have neglected our own.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.16
It has become racist to take pride in being British- to like the fact we drink tea, go to the pub, perform Nativities in primary school (not because we are Christian, but because it is a tradition we want to share with our children), to keep calm and carry on, to celebrate our history, our food, our language, our festivals, our sensibilities- our entire British way of thinking.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.17
Our culture.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.18
Our culture does exist.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.19
I want to learn about your culture.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.20
I want to enjoy everything the world has to offer.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.21
But I don't want to fear being proud of my beautiful country and being proud of being part of a family that is responsible for building it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.22
I don't want to be told I'm racist because I don't want one thousand years of history to disappear in the wake of overzealous liberalism.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.23
Immigration is okay if people want to integrate- but most of them don't.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.24
We just get self imposed segregation from micro-societies who don't care about learning our language or about our culture- but who are all too ready to impose their own on us.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.25
I could throw around statistics about crime rates, about the looming date by which 'white' people are to become a minority.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.26
But it's been done, so I wont.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.27
The facts are out there for those who care to read them, this gradual elimination of British culture either bothers you or it doesn't.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.28
*shrug* It bothers me.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0277.29
Agree 100%.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0278.1
That's a load of bull****e
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0278.2
You're gloryifying Breivik and his points of view.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0278.3
That is disgusting.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0278.4
The mask in your signature represents everything that is in complete opposition to your views.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0278.5
No, There's supporting his views and supporting what he did.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0278.6
I support his views on immigration.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0278.7
There is a difference between the two, I suggest you learn it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0279.1
I'm one of them.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0280.1
Ok, so:
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0280.2
Would some backwards English hating liberal on here (there are clearly many), care to explain to me why ONLY white countries need 'multiculturism'?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0280.3
What is it about white people which means they need replacing and have other cultures replace them?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0280.4
Why is 'multiculturism' not needed in Africa?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0280.5
In Asia?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0280.6
In black and brown countries?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0280.7
Where are the liberals proposing that millions of white christians are sent there to 'enrich' thier culture and countries?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0280.8
I dont expect an answer, because afterall, we all know that liberals who promote this nonsense, dont live in areas affected by immigration, and dont care about the effects it has had on this country in recent times.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0280.9
So tell me, why do only white countries need 'multiculturism' and 'enriching'?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0358.1
Fair enough.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0358.2
But in all honesty, WHO ACTUALLY CARES?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0358.3
We are all humans, its a piece of land at the end of the day.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0358.4
Im not gunna spend my time here squabbling over skin colour and arguing over which border line i was born in. If your going to come to Britain and contribute to the economy, local community or learn at a school/university then all be it!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0358.5
No matter what your skin colour or nationality.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0358.7
Where do you live, may I ask?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0359.1
The majority of the country supports diversity.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0359.2
It's our strength.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0359.3
So we need to keep it up, not nullify it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0359.4
A more mixed race nation is good thing and will only happen if we allow more immigrants to come in. So IMO as I said in another thread, the immigration policy over the last 10 years has been correct.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0359.5
Can I ask where you live?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0360.15
People like you are obviously jealous that people can have the best of both worlds.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0360.16
Mixed race people are often healthier, more intelligent and better looking.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0360.17
Science has shown this.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0360.18
Get over it you facist.

‘Cleansing’….
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0361.3
I think most people are aware that Genocide is illegal.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0361.4
But Genocide is not occurring in the UK....
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0361.5
the immigration, assimilation and integration of people is though.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0361.6
This is not illegal...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0362.7
Yup and one day we will have a mixed race majority and it will be a great day.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0363.1
sad, you can only be one or t'other, not a mix, thats just wrong against bloodlines!

''Britain should be white''!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0364.22
What do you even mean by that?!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0364.23
Many black people contribute to the British society just as much as white people do.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0364.24
You are a racist and people like you should be named and shamed.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0365.1
Yes, I didnt expect an answer.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0365.2
I simply want to know why the backwards liberals on here want to wipe out the English race from thier own country, and dont give a toss if the English become a minority....
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0365.3
in England.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0365.4
Is that too much to ask?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0365.5
Yeah, it is actually.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0366.1
The people make the country.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0366.2
You change the people, you change the country.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189852_0366.3
Yes, but not necessarily for the worse, and perhaps this is so superficial that it need not create a change at all.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0039.1
I'm not a racist but I feel like we're being completely taken over sometimes and I think we're pushovers.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0039.2
When we go abroad to muslim countries we have to cover ourselves up, yet when muslims are over here (a christian country) they get to wear whatever they like and walk around with their identity completely hidden despite the problems we've had with terrorism and the fact that hoodies are often disallowed in shopping centres.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0039.3
There are black/asian people in this country who think it's ok to say "I don't like white people" and there have been some seriously shocking cases lately.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0039.4
I read one on here actually about a white girl who was called a 'white slag' and viciously attacked by a group of somalian muslims.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0039.5
They beat her up really bad (completely unprovoked) but were let off because the argument was that they were drunk and as they're muslim they aren't used to alcohol.

Reading that made me want to scream with frustration and it's things like this that fuel racism.

I don't actually care if they were born here to be honest.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0039.8
Racism towards white people should be taken just as seriously as racism towards black people is.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0039.9
It is predominantly a white country so what makes them think it's ok to come over to our country and say they don't like us?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0039.10
Let alone attacking us purely because we're white!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0039.11
Sorry but no matter how old they are, if they're in the UK and being racist towards white people then I think they should be sent home or to where their parents are from.

LOL that gem, "I'm not racist but..."

Anyway, I am mixed race, and I think immigration needs to be brought down.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0040.3
Yeah I was trying to avoid saying that to be honest lol but it sort of comes naturally to feel the need to say "I'm not racist" before saying anything that even mentions problems with immigrants because everyone's so paranoid of looking like a racist.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0041.7
No.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0042.1
I'm not a racist but.

Always a good start.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0043.3
because the law mandates you to do so.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0043.4
Besides, last time I went to Dubai, I saw English women in swimsuits drinking on the beach- second, why on earth are you picking on the niqab- something that a tiny % of women actually wear, and compare it to hoodies?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0043.5
It is much more likely that a gang of kids wearing hoodies are more likely to shop lift or actively intimidate- hence their ban.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0043.6
Its also why Jainists are not banned from shopping centres.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0043.7
Finally, not wearing a niqab does not prevent terrorism.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0043.8
Part of being a terrorist is blending into your background- a Niqab does the exact opposite.

Why aren't these black or asian people not allowed to think or say it ?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0043.11

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0043.12
Regardless, it is racism, and quite often it is dealt with as such.

By your logic, ethnic people should automatically bow to you because your ethnic demographic is the majority ?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0043.23

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0043.24

Ok then....
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0043.28
Some ok points, most of it was just silly though
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0044.1
My problem with the idea of a loss of 'british culture' is that there is no static concept of what british culture actually is.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0044.2
All cultures change over time and in response to immigration e.g. so that now going for a curry and a pint is considered a british thing to do, and if you watched that latest Jamie Oliver programme apparently all of the food we consider to be traditionally british comes from immigrants.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0044.3
So if you want to go back to a completely british culture you'd probably have to go back and adopt tudor culture or something...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189862_0044.4
I'm not saying that we should just lie down and let everyone who wants to come here in, regardless of whether or not they will work etc. But I am sceptical of arguments based on the fact migrants shouldn't be allowed in because they are somehow erroding our culture...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189882_0033.13
I like it
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189882_0034.1
im actually going to jump to ops defence here, i think that we should be more protective of our industries, like the French and Germans are.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189882_0034.2
For instance, all the French police cars etc are all french made.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189882_0034.3
Granted, because we've pissed all of our industries up the wall, we cant do that with cars, but we can still protect farming?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189882_0035.1
Farming makes up about 2% of GDP, white it is something we should do more of it is not really something worth actively protecting.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189882_0035.2
That said, we should stop the French subsidies.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189882_0036.3
Most of the world's thorium is located in India, thats not going to help Britain if only British sources of energy are to be used.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189882_0037.1
Which is another reason why protectionism is bad, especially given that solar is only 40% efficient and wind only 25% efficient.

Here's a thought.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189882_0040.2
Where does oil and the majority of our gas come from?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189882_0040.3
The North Sea?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189882_0041.13
You mean like the power plant run in UK by a foreign state owned company (EDF) ?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189882_0041.14
(I never understood how your government ever allowed that but...)
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.1
That’s how it is now; Network Rail owns the infrastructure and the various train operators pay them for its use.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.2
These private companies obviously aren’t running services as effectively as they should though or this thread would never have been started.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.3
I might have misunderstood before as I thought you were arguing for competition between infrastructure providers as well as service operators- I’m glad we agree that competition can’t exist in that area, at least.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.5
However you’re still arguing that meaningful competition can exist between the service operators using that infrastructure.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.6
Due to the limitations touched on in my last post though, the problem is that railways are relatively unique in that there’s no obvious way there can be greater (fairer) competition, nor, more importantly, any indication as how more competition (effectively, fragmentation of the system) would actually lead to improvements in service.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.7
I mentioned before why a system run by a single organisation has an advantage over one outsourced to many, but I don't want to go over old ground again.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.8
Well I think we just have a fundamental disagreement here.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.9
If I didn't think competition could happen on trains, then yes, reluctantly, I would be in favour of nationalisation.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.10
Bet you didn't expect that
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.12
The other issue is that, when looking at the system as a whole, profitable areas of the business should be used to prop up the unprofitable.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.13
That’s only really achievable by having one entity in control of all aspects of the system, from signals to rolling stock, because the alternative is something akin to the current model where profitable parts of the system are taken over and run solely to funnel money into private hands, whilst public money is used to subsidise and invest in those parts of the system which the private sector don’t want.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.14
This is why I contend that a single organisation should be in charge of the system as a whole.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.15
It should be state-run (or at least state-owned) because of the obvious drawbacks to private sector monopolies- at least the government of the day is somewhat accountable.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.16
I address this later in the post, I think the point covers both.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.17
I’d have no problem with nationalising the water supply.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.18
Private ownership has led to massive under-investment in infrastructure which wastes millions of gallons of water every day, whilst utility bills rise and rise.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.19
But where would the public money come from to provide the investment!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.20
You already want the trains nationalised, now water and presumably royal mail.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.21
All of these things AT BEST would break even operationally.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.22
Look at German and Spanish banks, the weakest and least profitable are?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.23
You've guessed it, the state run firms.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.24
Publicly run businesses are typically inefficient in terms of budget, surely you can agree with me on that.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.25
I’m glad you brought Royal Mail up, too.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.26
It’s a perfect example of what I was talking about a couple of paragraphs up.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.27
RM worked when it had a monopoly over the postal service in which the profitable areas of the business were used to fund the less profitable areas; it operated a genuinely universal service, it was cheap and simple for the user, and it made money.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.28
It’s been gutted in recent years however by exactly the sort of cherry-picking you’ve advocated above.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.29
The more profitable parts of the company such as parcel delivery and inter- and intra-city mail were split from the rest of the network and sold to private companies (UKMail etc.).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.30
The subsequent loss of revenue from the profitable areas of the business led to under-investment, removal/reduction of services and financial difficulties for the remaining parts, such as the rural/long distance mail and the broader distribution network.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.31
Now reduced profits from what's left of the organisation have resulted in stronger calls from within government to privatise the rest of it, because apparently in it’s current form it's ‘not working’- ignoring the fact that it was government measures undermining the company that caused it to fail in the first place!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.32
I don't understand the cherry picking argument.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.33
You could nationalise BP or Vodafone, say, and harvest the profits to fund the trains for example.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.34
Why does it have to be within the same industry?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.35
It seems like you have a problem with companies making a profit.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.36
I (admittedly rather lazily) use monopoly simply to mean an industry/sector with a single entity controlling all or most of the business within it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.37
The French and German railways are both run by state-owned companies operating as virtual monopolies.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.38
I don’t know how much they cost to run, but they’re widely regarded as some of the most efficient and best value services on the continent.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.39
But you're still asking the car, bus, plane and coach user to subsidise the train user.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.40
Remember, the argument in favour of nationalisation was lower fares, more trains and greater investment.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0109.41
Each one of these will cost a great deal of public money.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0110.1

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0121.1
Indeed the argument can stretch very far - btw I'm also a newbie, perhaps we an be newbie buddies lol- but nowhere else in society is the relationship of private profits from public funding so concentrated and so unavoidable.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0121.2
I can't actually think of anywhere else where things are set up to run like that and tlwhere there's a valid argument that the state could run a better service.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0121.3
Yes, Tesco will obviously have a great incentive to invest in the company because they know that its very unlikely - especially in their present form- that they won't exist in another 5 years.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0121.4
Train companies on the other hand don't, they can never be sure if after one 5 year lease the government will grant them an rights to run services on the track for another 5 years, which is why they chicken-feed invest and have the state to do the rest, which is why for example the same rolling stock is being used on a privatised GWR as was during BR, because the company can't be added to commit themselves to spending if they're not sure if they'll be around in a decades time.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0121.5
The only guaranteed changed a company will warrant is new liveries on trains which is what first to best.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0121.6
Take Thameslink for example, First Group are using the same rolling stock from the 80's because instead of buying their own carriages, they've planned on waiting for the government to purchase the carriages (I've forgotten the number) for the north-south route which is desperately overcrowded.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0121.7
Instead, all First Group did was purchase well over 20year old, discount cheap stock from Southern and change the liveries, then voi la - apparently that's private investment.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0121.8
Their 'new' carriages simply aren't up to scratch, hence why Southern sold them.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0121.9
And the only reason why Southern took it upon themselves to buy new stock as opposed to waiting for the limped-legged treasury is because they were recently given a 7 year lease to run services out of London Bridge/ Victoria et al into the latter part of the next decade.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0121.10
That's the only way how private rail can run, by giving very lengthy leases to smaller companies (ideally even smaller than Southern), giving them an opportunity to grow an fund themselves - permitting that fares are regulated properly.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0121.11
But even then I'd be slightly against it for the reasons I've mentioned before.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0121.12
I want to argue against that, but you're right - points accepted.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0121.13

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0122.2
You don't seriously expect society to disintegrate because people are doing more business do you?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0122.3
No.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0122.4
I expect it to disintegrate because I believe many vital services cannot be delivered for a profit.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0122.5
Thus they will not be provided at all, and thus society will start to break down.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0122.6
Where there is demand for something, it can make a profit.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0122.7
If not, then the members of society don't value it - since the demand is not there.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0122.8
I cannot agree.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0122.9
How is an out of office GP's service in a rural area supposed to be profitable for example?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0122.10
You cannot use "well the demand isn't there" bull****, because such services have to be provided, else people will suffer and die.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0123.9
Except for the most part, the trains / carriages are not owned by the ToC's.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0123.10
They are owned by third party companies who essentially rent the rolling stock to the ToC's.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190772_0123.11
There are examples of ToC's owning train sets (FGW own a few of the HST's they use for example), but in general the actual trains are not owned by them.

Yes our college library had about four books on the Conservatives and about four hundred on the Labour Party.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6190879_0064.10
For the so called "oldest political party" you would think there would be a few more books.

I am not a fan of autobiographies because they contain so much information I don't care about.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.2
We're facing cuts to build for the future yet these people only care about themselves without thinking about the long term impact if we never had cuts now.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.3
Its not only that but the fact that these cuts are not going to leave people in severe poverty or leave people struggling, yes they may have to budget a bit better, yes they may have to go without a luxury now and then that they could have previously afforded, but those are issues we all have to face together.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.4
In my opinion these people should be thankful that there is welfare in place that they can always fall back on, if the worst comes to the worst and that they will always have a roof over their heads, food on the table and clothes to keep them warm.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.5
These people are massively over exaggerating the impact of these cuts.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.6
There are people in the world struggling to survive every day who do not cause the mayhem that they have done today.

Also, I can bet a lot of them are also the same people who blasted students for standing up against the tuition fee increase which was a lot more important.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.9
The tuition fee increase means people who want to go to university have to now take on board that they could have a massive amount of debt for the rest of their working lives.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.10
These cuts are not as severe, in any way at all.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.11
Okay, a lot of public sector jobs are being cut.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.12
However, that's Labours fault.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.13
They were the one who created occupations that weren't needed and didn't manage the public sector in the right way.

I find it hypocritical of Miliband to slate the coalition yet its his own parties wrong doing that led to the mess in the first place.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.18
Now the cuts may affect them due to them or relatives working in the public sector they care.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.24
They have sufficient enough money to live on and thats it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.25
They have a roof put over their head by the taxpayer, they can claim money to spend on food and clothes as well.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.26
Poor is when you're struggling massively to be able to feed yourself.

Why don't they consider these?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191481_0057.35
because of greed and selfish interests.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0030.1
First of all you grouped socialists and the Labour party in one massive group.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0030.2
Hardly given that Labour aren't really socialist in any sense of the word.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0030.3
Second of all you say that Labour left us with a massive deficit, which they did, but do you know why?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0030.4
Labour more or less had to spend these ludicrous amounts to prop up the economy.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0030.5
Consumer spending plummeted so to stop us from going into an even bigger mess they massively increased government spending, and to a degree it worked, and the recession wasn't as bad as it was in many other countries (Note that the Tories opposed this).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0030.6
It's also worth noting that before the recession, the deficit was actually lower than when they inherited it, so in other words had the recession not happened we would have a smaller deficit than the one the Tories left us with in 1997, which proves that Labour weren't spending recklessly before the recession hit, contrary to popular opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0030.7
So please stop with ridiculous with the ridiculous generalizations, tah.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0030.8
The recession lasted longer than any other G20 country and all this labour spending was totally unneccesary.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0030.9
Is giving 75% of senior civil servants a bonus in 09 a great idea at the depth of recession and a balooning defecit?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0030.10
Labour never cared about thrift, and we're all going to pay for it now.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0031.1
The more important question: do the Tory voters feel guilty for screwing over thousands of students, cutting **** loads of money from public services whilst lining the pockets of the exuberantly rich?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0031.2
Thanks.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0031.3
And when did that happen?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0032.1
Labour voters would feel proud that the party they voted for staved off a depression by injecting money into the economy, not to mention the succesful sure start program for example, and increased spending.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0032.2
We don't actually need spending cuts, if we kept spending the same, no public sector job losses would mean lower unemployment and as the economy recovers we could have more tax revenues and the deficit would slowly disappear.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0032.3
This was Labour's plan until the Tories came along and screwed it up.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0032.4
I just feel bad that the Tories are about short term economic ideas that will kill the economy in the long run - Labour are the ones who help the economy in the long run.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0032.5
(Think - how does putting more people on the dole help cut the deficit)
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0032.6
Its really strange why Conservative voters don't feel even a bit of shame at the way they've ruined Labour's plan to get the country going again and are ruining Britain?

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0032.11
We have a structural defecit, which means debt rises even as the economy grows.

Labour were going to make cuts.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0032.13
As for your point about the tories plan you cannot make judgements yet, third quarter growth was higher than anticpated, 4th quarter was lower, the spending cuts haven't begun yet so you can't blame the growth figures on cuts.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0033.1
What was the alternative?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0033.2
In 2001 was William Hague offering austerity measures and plans to run a fiscal surplus?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0033.3
No he was offering increased spending on defence, increased spending on law and order, and putting in all the usual guarantees of "we will NOT reduce spending from Labour's levels on health, we will NOT reduce spending on education" and so on.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0033.4
The main Conservative policies were anti EU and anti immigration.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0033.5
In 2005 more or less similar.

Michael Howard talked about targeting a spending reduction of £6bn.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0033.7
So lets say he got in in 2005, and we'd had 3 years of £6bn less spending.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0033.8
Look at the overall debt levels, would that have balanced the books.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0033.9
Would it heck.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0033.10
The Tories never once during the period up till the financial crisis, talked about tightening regulation on the banks or austerity measures.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0033.11
It is all stuff they have talked about after it happened.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0033.12
It's just the same as Labour did to John Major, Neil Kinnock supported the UK joining the ERM, when we joined Labour said it was about time, in the 1992 election Labour had a policy of supporting ERM membership.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0033.13
Then it went tits up and Labour spent the rest of that parliament castigating John Major for his shambolic policy of being in the ERM.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0033.14
As recently as 2006 you had George Osborne basing the Tory economic policy on the Irish model, because they were the 'Celtic Tiger' who had achieved fantastic growth through slashing corporation tax and investing more in public services at the same time (the fact that it was financed on borrowing didn't matter because they were as convinced as Osborne, who was as convinced as Brown, that the era of boom and bust was over).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191640_0033.15
So don't kid yourselves that there would have been anything different had the Tories won in 2001 or 2005.

It was coming down right from Thacher until 02.

And it's got absolutely nothing to do with years of incompetency and lack of initiative by the previous labour administration to put in place transport links as promised on time...

This is what happens when people price themselves out of the market.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191778_0049.5
Why should a business be forced to stay in a location where people demand higher wages, when there are people who will work for less elsewhere.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191778_0049.6
It's simply how labour markets work.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0049.1
Yes because that is a very clever statement to make.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0049.2
The fact is Royal Security are the ones massively at fault and they should have never taken Prince Charles & Camilla down that route.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0049.3
They were clearly taken that way to provoke students and make them out to look bad.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0049.4
Well done politicians and media for being successful at portraying all students to be thugs.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0049.5
I hope all of you who have branded students thugs never ever need a life saving operation because it will be a past student (graduate) carrying out the procedure to save your life - but then again why should you deserve help from people you branded as thugs?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0049.6
The police are the legalised thugs in all this and they make me absolutely sick.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0049.7
I hope the Army kettle and beat the hell out of police officers when they are rioting about being laid off and cuts are being made to the police budget.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0049.8
Lets see how they react when the tables are turned and they are putting in strikes which are far more damaging and cost the taxpayer more.

I won't be paying tax to help those moaning about today's students.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0049.12
Save your own pension because I won't be paying for it and I hope other students don't pay for it.

What was Camilla doing with her window wound down.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0049.14
Was she trying to kidnap a protester?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0050.1
Think you just about got your point across.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0050.3
Oh god.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0050.4
That was when tsr went really weird and had an error message.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0050.5
Sorry everyone....
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0051.1
They had someone on the news today pointing out that they had armed guards in there, and had things really kicked off he said AND I QUOTE: "It could have ended in tragedy, if they had been using petrol instead of paint, those armed guards might have been within their rights to shoot them"
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0051.2
Beyond that, I think students need to go about their means a different way.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0051.3
When the idiots who don't represent the protestors start kicking off, protestors should just sit down...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0051.4
Or avoid the whole situation altogether by doing something really positive.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0051.5
Like getting all those who oppose the tuition fee rises to give blood on the same day.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0051.6
One of the reasons students are supposed to be so great is because they are innovative.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0051.7
Channel all of that to a modern way of protesting which means that the cause can not be hijacked and I believe that they will be much more succesful (although I completely disagree with them)
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0052.1
Nobody deserves to be have their car attacked
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0052.2
This is so true, attacking a car is just over the top!!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0053.1
It is disgraceful, but I must admit I couldn't suppress a giggle when I saw the photo of them on the cover of the Metro this morning.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.1
So the consensus seems to be that it is okay for a mob to dictate what roads we can and cannot go down?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.2
Interesting but I don't agree with that.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.3
Wow!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.4
I mean...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.5
Wow!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.6
Possibly the dumbest assumption on this subject I have seen, and there have been so many.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.7
Believe me, the students don't need to be made to look bad - their behaviour is doing that already.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.8
My one piece of advice to anyone interested in the discussion on University fees is...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.9
READ THE FACTS FIRST.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.10
The vast majority of students seem to be getting their information from idiot friends, Facebook postings, Labour party propaganda or just plain making it up.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.11
Here is my top 10 important FACTS you should all be aware of: · The £9000 figure being quoted is the MAXIMUM that a University will be able to charge per year.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.12
Obviously they can charge a lot less if they want/can.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.13
Previously the maximum fee was £3290 but then they had lots of government (i.e. tax payer) subsidy then.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.14
If Universities charge £6000 or more they need to abide by strict access agreements with the 'Office for Fair Access' to allow lower income students to attend.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.15
If they don't stick to the agreements then OFFA can fine them up to £500,000.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.16
For low income students there is the newly set up £150m National Scholarship Programme which will pay for the first year of their course.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.17
If Universities charge £6000 or more for a course then any student who would have been eligible for free school meals (if they were at school) would have their second year tuition fees paid for by the University.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.18
This can actually mean that for a three year course they only pay for one year!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.19
Maintenance grants for households earning less than £25,000 raises from £2906 to £3250 a year.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.20
Households earning up to £42,000 can still get a partial grant.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.21
The reason for the increase to the cap is because the Universities will get less money in subsidies and have to be more independent.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.22
If the fees aren't increased then the Uni's will have to provide either less courses or lower the quality of courses which is not good for anyone and would make UK qualifications less valuable in the world job market.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.23
Plus, foreign students who pay the FULL fees (much more than UK students) will go elsewhere for more valuable qualifications meaning even less money for UK Uni's.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.24
The students will not have to pay back these student loans until they earn £21,000 a year or more (increased from £15,000 previously).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.25
Even if the students earn £21,000 these are INTEREST FREE loans.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.26
If they earn more then they will have to pay a small amount of interest up to 3% (plus inflation) for incomes of £41,000 a year or more.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.27
If they have not cleared the debt 30 years after graduating then the loan is wiped clean.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.28
The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that only about 10% of graduates will end up paying back more than they borrowed.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.29
The rest will pay back either what they owed (interest free) or less because they reach the 30 year cut off.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.30
Suddenly it doesn't seem quite so bad.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0055.31
Agree with everything above, but try telling that to the sh*t for brain idiots who believe everything they come across they are entitled to, and whenever they want it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0056.1
They have nothing to do with the fees increasing.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0056.2
How would you like it if someone hit you for no reason...?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0056.3
There wasn't a single part of my post that implied they were responsible for the fees increasing.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0056.4
They didn't get hit, they got a smashed window and paint on their car.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0057.2
If you're going to quote me, I'd appreciate it if you didn't alter what I say to suit you.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0057.3
Or at least make it more clear where the alterations begin, and where my actual comments end.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0057.4
In any case, I assume that you would be angry if a group of people surrounded your car and smashed the windows while shouting threats.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0057.5
I might suggest that you would think it was, "just over the top."
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0059.5
I was correcting your statement as it was the car that got attacked.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0059.6
And honestly im not that fussed.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0059.7
Now be quiet or i'll kick your car!

You said in your post that you would laugh at Camilla if she got hit.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0062.1
It's just appeared on the AP wires and the BBC live coverage.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0062.2
People who spilled over from the "protest" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0062.3
No harm done to them, apparently.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0062.4

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0064.4
im not supporting the students, im just wondering why its any worse than if it were ordinary people?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0064.5
royals do not deserve special treatment, they're just ordinary people
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0065.1
It's important - a group of protestors overwhelmed the Police Escort.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0065.2
That sort of thing is not supposed to happen.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0065.3
As for disliking them - you might not, but they're still people.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0065.4
Nobody deserves to be attacked just for being born into the 'wrong' kind of family, be it very poor, or very rich.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0065.5
They got attacked by being born in that kind of family.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0065.6
I got my loans risen by being born in that kind of family.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0065.7
We got beaten.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0065.8
They too.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0065.9
Simple.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0065.10
Life is hard I know.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0066.1
The point isn't that the attack was minor, it was that it could happen at all.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0066.2
Royal security is supposed to be better.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0066.3
One day I would get some TSR users and we will beat almost to death all members of the Royal family except the Queen.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0066.4

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0066.5
It feels good.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0067.2
Wouldn't be surprised if the police escort let the students attack them on purpose.

Just for lols at camilla getting floored.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0067.4

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0068.1
Agree with first poster - Royals should have more power.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0068.2
Well, Her Majesty should, anyway.

Ergh, they'll raise the fees again to pay for the damage done to the car
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0070.1
I enjoyed Boris Johnson's comment about the attack being an insult to democracy, seems a touch ironic when discussing the royals, no?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0070.2
Democracy?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0070.3
With monarchy?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0070.4
wtf?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0070.5
Monarchy by itself erases great part of the meaning of democracy.

It's like trying to make fire in the middle of the ocean in water surface.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0071.6
I think you'll find they fought "For King and Country"...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0072.6
I have fallen in love with your comment.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0072.8

Are they?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0073.6
That's funny because I think the majority of the current UK population are under the illusion that we are under the leadership of Cameron & Clegg.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0073.7
Or those 2 seem to think that its only their opinions that matter.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0073.9
The UK is not a full democracy and we as the people of the UK never vote on all the main issues.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0073.10
We also hardly ever get listened to on the majority of topics.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0074.2
They fought for the country (if it was ruled by a King okay, but that was something out of their reach).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0074.3
The King likes being King for the power and nothing else, otherwise he would be begging to be taken his position as soon as possible.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0074.4
Why would someone fight for someone who would not fight for you had the King the chance?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0146.1

I picture you as being Will off the Inbetweeners - a briefcase ****er up his own ass.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0146.8
And yeah I know those things because I have visited loads of uni's, and it doesn't take a genius to see the differences.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0146.9
But sure, keep telling yourself its all based on some guy with a clipboard.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0146.10
All the league tables are based on someone with a clipboard going around taking an annual report of everything at that university and also you don't know what university is better until you've actually been lectured there or had an experience as a student there.

It entirely depends on how the students uses what he/she has at his/her disposal.

I also find it funny how you've said you've visited loads of universities - there are over 100 universities in the UK.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0146.14
Any normal person with a job wouldn't be able to visit many so therefore I take it your unemployed.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0146.15
Hmm, it's strange anyone goes to the best unis.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0146.16
No idea why they're so competitive.

Because people want to be able to say "I went to Cambridge/Oxford" with a smug look on their face as if they are better than anyone else.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0146.18
No they really are not.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0146.19
they normally lack any form of social interaction and can not get on in the real world.

And seriously, shut up about Sony.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0146.25
Well why think you know better when clearly I have experience in the sector.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0146.26
You may know more about another sector and that's fair enough.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0146.27
To say no one cares is speaking on behalf of everyone else which you do not have the right to do.

Tell me how your democratic rights is being infringed by having a monarch, go on tell me...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0148.2
The fact is the Prime Minister has all the de-facto power, he/she is the person giving the orders during times of crisis, he/she is the person who decides policy.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0148.3
The Monarchy is an effective system of checks and balances and nothing more, it infringes on no one's right for democracy.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0148.4
Oh and before someone jumps up and down and yells but we don't elect our head of state and so that's bad and we aren't free, Norway is frequently voted as the most democratic nation on Earth and guess what they have...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0148.5
yup a Monarch.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0148.6
This was a disgraceful act of violence and would have been whether it was against a citizen or anyone else.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0148.7
What makes it more worrying is that this is the heir to the throne, that used to mean something....
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0148.8
The very fact that we have to pay them is enough to affect your rights.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0148.9
And what equality means.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0148.10
You should look up the meaning of monarchy in the dictionary.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0148.11
Just that.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0148.12
I don't care if people vote a country without knowing about it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0148.13
If Norway is the most voted it does not mean that it is the most democratic.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0148.14
Of course it was an act of violence but it looks like the event of the day.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6191965_0148.15

More tax money needs to be spent in Scotland in order to maintain: · 1) People - as they're poorer · 2) Infrastructure - as in some areas, it's not used as much.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0071.3
The cost of living is also much cheaper in Scotland than in England, therefore their wages will get them just as far as an English person.

Yes its unfair, but grow a pair and calm down and for Gods sake don't resent your heritage!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0072.2
Also surely if you can prove you are part Scottish you could go to a Scottish university for free?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0072.3
Nope, Dad's from Cullen, North Scotland however as we live in England, Cambridge, I can't go to a Scottish Uni for free.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0072.4
My cousin went to Aberdeen for free though as her family still live in Scotland, although thank God I've never had to!!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0073.3
What is SO bad about Scotland that you wouldn't want to live here then?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0074.1
I recently wrote a letter to my local MP (Mr Vara - NW Cambridgeshire) asking him how the Government can still provide Scottish students with free university fees, whilst English and Welsh students are having to dish out up to £9000 each year.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0074.2
I got the usual answer, how the Scottish parliament all voted on this issue, and due to the devolution agreement the British government are unable to overturn this decision.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0074.3
Firstly, this just seems ridiculous, how possibly can they consider raising our fees whilst Scottish students are still getting their fees paid for them?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0074.4
Secondly,EU students aren't subject to paying fees for Scottish University whilst English and Welsh students (despite us being in the EU too..)
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0074.5
pay full fees which seems to be 'double standards' if you ask me.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0074.6
I personally believe it comes down to jealously by the Scottish, and a feable attempt to try and 'get one over' on the English, purely as they fear losing their National Identity.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0074.8
Any other views on this?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0074.9
p.s. I am half Scottish and half English, although resent being half scottish, I consider myself English...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0074.11
I think you're the one who's jealous..
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.1
I posted this in another thread recently, the points I make are still valid.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.2
It's worth nothing that the way that the Barnett Formula works, the budget cuts shall not hit Scotland for another year (at least).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.3
Scotland has two basic issues:
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.4
1) The population is slightly poorer on average when compared to England.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.5
Glasgow is one of, if not the poorest cities in the UK.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.6
An estimated 41% of Glasgow residents are described as in poverty.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.7
The greater · Glasgow area makes up the largest percentage of Scotland's population.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.8
2) Scotland is not densely populated.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.9
England: 395 people per square kilometre · Scotland: 95 people per square kilometre · Rural populations still need the infrastructure that more densely populated areas have.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.10
Although, as it is used less frequently, it costs more - as a ratio - to maintain/build as it does in heavily populated areas.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.11
England is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.14
I'm more than happy for taxation to be spend on these things.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.15
If it wasn't Scotland that had the highest tax spending per capita, it would just be another country.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.16
If the Scottish/English xenophobes had their way and Scotland became independent, what would happen next?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.17
Would you annex the North-East of England because too much tax is spent there?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.18
The Scottish government's policies of: free personal care for the elderly, free university tuition and other things such as free prescriptions shall not be viable in the long term.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.19
I suspect that when the UK government budget cuts feed through to Scotland (they're delayed because of the complexities of the Barnett Formula), it'll be necessary to scrap some of these programmes.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.20
While this is all true, the fact that the Barnett Formula calculates the grant to be great enough to provide that AND fund higher education/prescription charges etc. clearly suggests that the grant is larger than is necessary in order to fund the provision of services in the same manner as in England.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.21
Also I find it really irritating when Scottish people say something along the lines of "it's your MPs you need to complain to, not us" - actually it's YOUR MPs we need to complain to!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.22
The majority of English MPs voted against tuition fees in England, but it was passed when Scottish MPs decided English students should pay and Scottish students shouldn't.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192036_0075.23
Unfortunately as they have no accountability to anyone in England there's nothing we can do about it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.1
For the last few weeks students have been branded as thugs, layabouts, a waste and leeches on society.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.2
Why on earth should we after graduating get jobs in the UK to pay tax to fund the pensions of these people who call us such names?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.3
Why should we help those who disrespect us so much?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.4
Not only this but law students will be aiding these people in lawsuits and legal proceedings.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.5
NHS Students will in the future be carrying out operations to help those very people who branded them worthless thugs.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.6
Medicine students will be finding out about new treatments for diseases a lot of these older people are more likely to get.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.7
Computer Scientists will be creating new technologies to make lives easier on a day to day basis from work to home experience - from programmes like AutoCad that keeps thousands in jobs.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.8
Why the hell on this earth should we graduate and help these people branding us such things?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.9
I am moving to a country where they respect students, where students get recognition for trying to improve themselves, gain more knowledge, try and gain a better education to help society in the long run.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.10
In this country students are massively disrespected yet at least they are trying to better themselves rather than running along to the JSA queue to claim from the taxpayer to do absolutely nothing.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.11
Let me ask you people who brand us thugs.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.12
Q: Who do you think will pay your pensions in the future when you are older?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.13
A: The taxpayer - a lot of the high paying tax payers will be graduates
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.14
Q: Who will be contributing the most tax to help the country?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.15
A: Ex graduates
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.16
Exactly, graduates will pay for you at one point so instead of labelling us as thugs and leeches you should encourage us to achieve the best in order to improve employment prospects which in turn will more than likely mean a bigger salary and a bigger contribution of tax.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.17
I've had enough personally and after graduation and I don't even start until 2011 but once I graduate I will take my degree and I will go to countries like Germany, USA, Australia & Eastern European countries where graduates/students are respected for their willingness to learn and the effort and time they put in. In the UK everyone just likes moaning.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.18
Without students, this country would lose all its technically gifted people, would lose all its main surgeons and researchers and all its very well educated employees.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.19
Just you think about that!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.20
Its better to have too many people with a degree than not enough believe you me.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.21
I just hope you people who brand us thugs never ever need a serious operation because I wonder if you will call that graduate a thug and worthless to society then when he is saving your life.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.22
i agree with you, its a ironic story also.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.23

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.24
I go when there is a job for me.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0003.25
Being in the film industry art department doesn't tie me to UK, i might go abroad for work
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0004.1
A lot of the people that disagree with the students actions were students at some point.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0004.2
Do not think that you will be the only people to treat patients, defend/prosecute people in courts and the like.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0004.3
When the people you will work with and learn from when you actually earn a living will be graduates with more work experience than your lifespan, and a lot of them see the wrong doing in your actions.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0005.1
Leaving the UK after graduation is a great idea, but be aware that this won't exempt you from paying back tuition fees and student loans.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0005.2
The Student Loans company will still hunt you down and try to make you pay even if you live in Australia.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0005.3
Yesterday was the day that the Lib Dems killed higher education in this country.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0005.4
9k in fees today and then after a few years and inflation what next 20k a year ?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0005.5
30k ?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0005.6
This won't be the last rise in tuition fees.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0006.2
I'll pay back the loans for the education I received, I have no issues with that.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0006.3
I won't however be paying additional tax into the UK because students and graduates do not get any respect for trying to gain an education and improve their knowledge of a subject or sector.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0006.5
That's fine.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6192181_0006.6
I'll pay my loans back to the SLC and pay my tax to the Australian Government or the German government - governments that actually encourage students instead of branding them thugs and worthless leeches.

Being poor does not mean you are stupid.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193043_0152.11
Many people take jobs that do not pay as well as other jobs they are qualified for for personal reasons.

They usually make their money in jobs of responsibility - headmasters, business leaders, doctors, bankers etc. I don't care what those on the left say, these people are highly-skilled and work damn hard for their money.

In fact, if the Left is correct, rich people are less likely to use government services such as state education, healthcare etc. If you believe that rich people have got the most out of UK conditions in order to succeed in life and should pay more tax for it then surely you believe in a 'pay-as-you-use' system for healthcare, education etc. paying only for what you use.

Up until a few months ago, my plan was to leave school at 16, get a full time job, and get some more cash in for the family, even though i actually like school.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.6
Anyways, long story short, I then found out about EMA, which will make my life a whole lot easier.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.7
I can get a part time job and still study and then go onto university, so yes i agree with gettng cold hard cash, because not all of us will be spending it on booze, I know i will be spending it wisely, and book tokens and bus passes would not help me at all, I would need petrol money instead of bus fair etc, which youneed money for rather then tokens.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.8
I think EMA is mis-managed in some cases though.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.9
Il give you a for instance.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.10
I know someone who is a "bad lad" as in has commited numerous crimes and is under the age of 18.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.11
He recieves £60 per week, ontop of weekly bonusses for actually just BEING there.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.12
Its ridiculous.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.13
Ooh also, i know someone who gets £30 because she lives with her mum who doesnt work, but her dad earns 90K a year, even though she gets £500 a month from her father.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.14
Now that is ridicuous, especially when i have a friend in the opposite situation, she lives with her mother and father, who have good paying jobs, but she has a huge huge family, and they dont even get pocket money, yet she gets no EMA.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.15
So the system is a bit hayward, and needs some management.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.16
Oh and then theres the girl who does 2 hours per week, and gets £30!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.17
thats insane!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.18
If i was PM, id make a bank/debit type account for each person who in my eyes was entitled to EMA, however you wouldnt be allowed to take any money from it, you would only be able to buy things from the card if you get what i mean, have it a certain bright colour, and make it synonomous with EMA too so that people in off licenses will see that its an EMA card, and deny them the right to buy alcohol.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.19
Simple solution in my eyes, and would make life so much easier.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.20
Oh, and if the school suspect they are using their EMA for the wrong things, the school/college should be able to check online or something to see what has been bought.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6193923_0154.21
Its just an idea though.

Theres nothing worse then "better off" folk saying things similar to: "it will be easy for you, youl get £30 a week" When most of the time, they get regular pocket money, and have been since child hood, along with a contract phone, money to go out with friends, piano lessons, private maths tutors, wheras people such as myself have not had any of these priveleges.

No-one is disputing that foreigners work very hard; indeed they often show that they are hard workers.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.3
But the point is that we have people already here who will need jobs either right now or in the future.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.4
And it's not just skilled jobs but also unskilled jobs.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.5
Any skilled foreigner can arrive in this country and take unskilled work, and they often do.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.6
This increases the competition for jobs, and there is also an assumption that Brits are lazy; all Brits, which is just not true.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.7
Also, in my experience, foreign workers take two or more jobs to bump up their income.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.8
There is no law against this, but it does push out further those people who have no job and need a job; just one job.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.9
For every foreign worker who takes two jobs, for example, two British workers are left without a chance of a job.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.10
Is that fair?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.11
I don't think so.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.12
It has nothing to do with being British or being foreign; it has to do with fairness.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.13
There is already a growing need for jobs; there is already fierce competition for jobs without the need for foreigners coming here and applying for jobs which only serves to increase the competition.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.14
This is what creates this tension with foreign workers.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.15
Yes, they are hard working, and yes, some of us Brits are not as motivated to keep or get a job, but some of us do show motivation and some of us see that the work we can do is being taken by foreigners who should actually not contribute to the increase in competition and therefore sideline those who are in need of work.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.16
It is unfair to those who really are seeking employment.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.17
It may be good for the economy but it is not fair on those who feel the brunt end of fierce competition for jobs, especially when there is this notion of "lazy Brits" hanging over their heads like an extra black cloud.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.18
I don't think most British people are too lazy to work but I think they have unrealistic expectations of work.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.19
Lots of Brits think they are too good to pick vegetables, work in a noisy factory or put up with the tedium of most office or shop work.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.20
They want an interesting job with good pay and prospects but don't have the qualifications or experience.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.21
I don't think most Brits want to start at the bottom and do tedious low paid jobs before they get the experience to climb up the career ladder.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.22
Immigrants will do the low paid tedious jobs and lots of industries like farming and cleaning have to rely on them.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.23
If they weren't avialable, lots of farms and cleaning firms would become uneconomical and would shrink or close down and deprive the country of taxes.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6194020_0206.24

After all the work of people like Richard Oastler who helped pass the Factory Act in 1802(?) and Michael Sadler et al. in 1332, pre -date Marx's Manifesto of 1848 by decades.

Also your mum is educated and a professional, therefore i still believe you are considered middle class.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0035.18
There are some upper class people who are poor in terms of wealth but due to the fact they are noble or have been born into a know upper class family they are still considered upper class.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0036.3
Parents don't want to cling onto their children til their 21 (I hope not anyway) and they should see University as a way of them moving on and starting their own lives.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0036.4
With someone who has family going away on holiday for 2 weeks (Probably due to a stressful job) then he'd feel like a burden upon his family and that sort of thing I'd rather go through debts than have to put up with :/
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0036.5
And for example, I have a Middle Class family earning top bracket £60-80K a year but I also have 3 brothers and a sister to look after.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0036.6
My older brothers have moved out, although one of them is having a baby soon and the other is in Dubai and at the minute needs support while he sorts out his work.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0036.7
I have University in 2 years, my younger sister will go after me and my younger brother after.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0036.8
My parents can NOT afford to pay for 9 years of debt and tuition fees and there are some probably in even worse situations than mine!
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0036.9
The point is, just because the household income is this that and that, doesn't mean they can afford University.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0036.10
This is also something I disagree with EMAs, they don't take the amount of family that might need to be supported outside the household as well.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0036.11
The point is, education is something the government "seems" (You never know in todays world :/) keen on, trying to get more and more people to University etc. But of course, this scheme puts a large proportion of Middle Class who I'm sure make up the majority of University students go through even MORE debts and that'll put more and more people off University and the number of applicants will DROP from the Middle Class, the Lower Class will expect to be able to get in without Tuition Fees and Universities will find themselves in MORE debt.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0036.12

Because the proportion of people in the upper class is so small that charging them that little bit more won’t make a difference.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0038.3
Why should those who can afford it pay more?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0038.4
Because every home student's fee is subsidized such that government pays for the bulk of their education cost.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0038.5
That said, why shouldn’t they pay more for their own education if they can afford it?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0038.6
Why give preference to underprivileged?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0038.7
Because if you were born in a working class family I guarantee your sights will be set lower than Oxbridge if you intend to go to university at all.

However, I am not sure if the way you outlined above is the best way to rectify the problem.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0038.9
Middle class already pay more tax than the lower class.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0038.10
So technically upper class people who pay the most taxes, should pay less tuition fees.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0038.11
Not that they care...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6195950_0038.12

It's just the side of Pakistan I've always seen is literally a world away from what I saw, I think I've always known that the higher class are extremely different to most other Pakistanis but actually seeing it is a whole other feeling.

My mum was born and brought up here like me, and my dad came here at a young age, so both are very different to most of my Pakistani friends' parents.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796283_0032.12
I think their outlook is slightly different, yet I think somehow the Pakistani values have been instilled in me.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796283_0032.13
And of course, no culture is superior to the next, but when Pakistan was created with a certain vision its sad to see it all wither away not too long after, if that makes sense?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796283_0032.14
I guess the more I think about it, it's true.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796283_0044.4
I have been on holiday to Pakistan a fair amount of times, and have traveled throughout the country, so I thought I had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it's people.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796283_0044.5
However, after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on Pakistan I am absolutely shocked.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796283_0044.6
I may be wrong when I say this, but was Pakistan not founded as a Muslim state, yet only 64 years on and I don't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796283_0044.7
It seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting western culture, in a sense it boosts their superiority complex.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796283_0044.8
I actually find it shocking, that most families who moved to England in the 60's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in Pakistan.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796283_0044.9
Drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally I find it quite upsetting, it seems as if Pakistan is moving in the opposite direction- the rich becoming more obsessed with western culture and the less well off being neglected further.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796283_0045.3
While I can understand your sentiment that is undesirable for tradition to be dismantled, ever since the fall of the wall in 1989, Liberal democratic values have spread (End of History, Fukuyama, 1992) and that does not preclude (just yet) the sovereign states whom are conformed to Islamic teachings as their rule of law.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796283_0045.4
Western culture gives people individuality and lets them choose whether to follow conservatism or choose their own destiny and the right to enjoy any liberties they desire (as long as it doesn't harm anybody else).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796283_0045.5

Britain did not 'whip up extremism', Britain recognised different religious groups, and encouraged all religious groups to have their own identity.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796283_0181.5
A mistake, but not really 'whipping up extremism'.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796283_0181.6
It's not Britain's fault that once these religious types realised their own identity they felt the need to start killing people and engaing in sectarian violence.

First of all, Jews did not immigrate to the point where they formed a majority:
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.4
[ <a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/palpop.htm">http://www.mideastweb.org/palpop.htm</a> - includes sources]
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.5
Secondly, the Jews did not divide Mandated Palestine nor was the idea to establish a Jewish homeland based on guilt from the Holocaust - how can you even say this nonsense?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.6
The only thing the Holocaust did was underline the need for a Jewish homeland, an idea that that really came to fruition in the late 1800's when Theodore Herzl lead the First Zionist Congress which then lead to the creation of the the World Zionist Organization.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.7
The pledge to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine came about with the Balfour Deceleration in 1917 which was incorporated into a peace treaty during the San Remo conference in 1920 (which included Britain, France, Italy, Japan and the US) - this is at least 2 decades before WW2 started.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.8
Expanding on the above, the idea to partition Palestine originated around 1937 with the Peel Commission which was then followed up by the Woodhead Commission (later evaluated at the St. James Conference) - these were British en-devours, not nefarious Jewish plans.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.9
The idea to partition arose due to the understanding that Jewish and Arab interests were irreconcilable - during this, violence was increasing more and more.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.10
The British wanted out of Palestine as soon as possible and as such, they handed power over to the UN in 1947.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.11
The UN then established UNSCOP to devise a solution and they too came up with a partition plan which took the form of a GA resolution - Israel declared independence according to the partition plan a day before the British Mandate was due to expire and in 1949 they were admitted to the UN so no, the Jews did not exceed their authority, gain a majority through immigration or come up with a nefarious plan to split Palestine.

Here's a tip for you.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.13
If you don't want to expose yourself as being an anti-Semitic moron, then try not to say things like "I had a feeling you were a Jew" or "...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.14
Defender of the Jews", trying replacing the word "Jew" with "Zionist", it's much more covert.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.15
Don't bother trying to say "but but I can't be antisemitic because Arabs are Semitic and I don't mind them!"
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.16
- the term antisemitism was coined by the Jew-hating German Wilhelm Marr in 1987~ and as such refers to Jews, not Semitic people.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.17
I guess, according to your "logic", Palestinians aren't allowed to 'defend' themselves because the bastards have a habit of killing innocent Jews spanning from 1920 up until 2011
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.19
According to <a href="http://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000636#chart1">http://israelipalestinian.procon.org...</a> <a href="http://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000636#chart1">=000636#chart1</a> , · Jews were in the majority from about 1950 onwards.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.20
As you can see from your charts, they increased as a percentage of the total population steadily before that (although there was a big jump in 1948, when some 850 000 jewish people immigrated)
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.21
I believe there is little general denial that the western european states looked upon the setting up of a Jewish state a lot more favourably after WW2.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.22
That does not mean it was a nefarious plan.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.23
However they did mass immigrate, both before it became a state and afterwards.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.24
They then took control.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.25
According to my logic, you should punish the perpetrators, instead of a group of people which includes the perpetrators.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.26
The state is not responsible as a whole for the firing of rockets.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.27
However they are all punished.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.28
The entire point of discrimination is to group a number of people together and act like they are all responsible for what a small percentage of that group has participated in. Examples are people who blame every algerian immigrant they see for theft because algerians have a higher crime rate on average in their country, or all the christian democrats getting murdered in a 1930s German city because 2 resisted the SS or SA.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.29

bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.33
They have now almost split up into two separate countries, where some inhabitants of one send a few rockets to the other side once a while.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.34
The other side has invaded with soldiers and tanks, decided what is allowed into the country and harasses people from the other side several times a day (when they cross checkpoints or the border).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.35
The division is nowhere near to how the UN decided the country should be divided.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0128.36
I strongly hope that on one side the new Egyptian government will open the border to allow any non-arms kind of trade (such as building materials) and that the Israeli government realizes that laws regarding freedom of speech issues (such as a ban on speaking in favour of boycotting products from Israeli settlements based in Palestinia) only create more frustration and are not in its long-term interest.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796411_0129.1
Because they people they are supposedly being 'defending' themselves against are systematically having their rights taken away by Israeli foreign policy who insist they life in a state of complete autonomy with no world recognition or any equality - and for that matter, subjecting Palestinians to torture, regularly bombing schools and hospitals and refusing to allow them the basic tools and materials to rebuild their society and economy.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796808_0161.2
You've become overawed by all this bull**** romanticism and propaganda instead of using your brain, the sort of chap who sings "Go on home British soliders" when are no British soldiers on patrol in NI.

You're being used - if you keep going like this it's likely you'll end up a member of the conties or ONH, cannon fodder for extremists.

Wise up and snap out of it.

Ever since the intervention in Afghanistan and drone attacks of Pakistan, can anyone give me a successful attack by al-Qaeda on the West since the intervention?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0071.3
Some people should know better that the United States and her allies are not on some mission to kill innocent civilians, quite the contrary.

Most of the contributions in this topic have failed to recognize that Islamic fundamentalists have been operating in Pakistan and are the root cause of terrorism in that area.

Terrorist attacks have killed over 35,000 people.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0071.10
If we compare this to figure of civilian casualties (which I will go into) it is quite a healthy ratio as of the 1658 to 2597 killed, 385 were thought to be civilians, in contrast of the Taliban/al-Qaeda's operations to kill civilians.

From a strategy perspective, in 2009 and 2010, air drones were equipped with new missiles called Small Smart Weapon (SSW) or typically known as 'Scorpion.

Hmm the real figure of civilian drone death is unkown.

Why the double standards?

It's not double standards, there's just an opportunity to save more lives albeit, at the expense of a few.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0073.1
6% means that a disproportionately small number of terrorist attacks were carried out by Muslims.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0073.2
Secondly, 9/11 is not the worst thing to ever happen in history.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0073.3
Of course it was utterly disgraceful, disgusting and wrong, but worse things have happened.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0073.4
Perhaps it was the most devastating terrorist attack in America, but the ones that trail behind it were mostly carried out by non-Muslims.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0073.5
Secondly, and more importantly, for every American death at the hands of terrorists, even if you want to include non-Muslim ones (ie the majority), there must be thousands of deaths that America has inflicted in other countries.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0073.6
Though attacks on America are not justified by this, it would be foolish to think that such aggression would not have repercussions.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0073.7
And so what, was going to war worth America having access to him directly?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0073.8
Considering that if they had of just accepted indirect access, 9/11 would never have happened?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0073.9
I agree America has inflicted hundreds of 'ground zeroes' so to speak.

1. Having your land split into lots of little pieces.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0137.15
4. Having white phosphorous bombs chucked on you.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0137.16
5. Having a blockade imposed on me.

What about the mothers who wanted to protect their kids if the protest turned violent?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0162.6
What about the men who had to work on that day to feed their families?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0162.7
What about the people who had the desire to protest but couldn't due to prior family engagements?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0162.8
What about the people who are NOT allowed to protest?

bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0163.6
Comparing the two and suggesting that nationalist/seperatist attacks are more dangerous is ridiculous, try comparing the death tolls caused by ETA in the last 30 years compared to one attack in Madrid by Islamic fundamentalists.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0163.7
Even the IRA failed to cause as many casualties on mainland Great Britain as Pakistani trained suicide bombers did in one day.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0163.8
So you chucked the statistics out of the window by claiming "nationalist attacks are rare"?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0163.9
At this point, I would like to mention that although nationalist attacks MAYBE rare, they nevertheless are 96.4% more then Al Qaeda bombings.

Does giving "hours of warning" make the act a bit more humane?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0163.11
It sounds like you support terrorist attacks, but with just a tiny weeny bit of warning beforehand.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0163.13
Suicide bombing - Well, they see it as a more effective tool.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0163.14
They want maximum casualties and the way to go about achieving that is through suicide bombing.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0163.15
The attacks are going on in Pakistan because Pakistan can't be trusted to deal with the Al-Qaeda/Taliban operatives in their country via their legal system.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0163.16
If Pakistan actually wanted to co-operate and help the fight against these guys then the drone attacks wouldn't be needed.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0163.17
Instead Pakistan is still obsessed with it's age old conflict with India and believes it needs to control Afghanistan to prevent India getting a foothold, thus it constantly funds and trains the same people it's telling America it's fighting.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796850_0163.18

Are you telling me that if Russia invaded, occupied and slaughtered people of England, residents of Wales/Scotland/Northern Ireland would not support and fund the English to get rid of the occupying force by any means necessary, not limited to suicide bombings?

In NOrthern Ireland, despite how I despise the IRA, I can say surely that they did not intentionally try to kill as many civilians as possible, they didn't execute teachers who taught girls, they didn't whip people for not growing beards etc. I never agree with terrorism, but to put the IRA on the same level as AQ or Islamic insurjents just showcases your ignorance.

America intervened during the cold war...
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5797179_0070.12
it led to the current situation.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5797179_0070.13
America ceased to fight because it would have been tantamount to aggression against China, whom border the North.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5797179_0070.14
China would in no way appreciate any new aggression because they prefer to have a dilapidated communist state on their doorstep when the alternative is something like south Korea, which is capitalistic, extremely pro-western and essentially the antithesis of Chinese culture; and would therefore probably alter chinese culture, or demonstrate the temptations of capitalism to its people.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5797179_0070.15

There are obviously many important differences between 1920s Germany and 21st century Britain.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5805248_0013.5
- Germany was raped far, far harder than Britain has been; · - the welfare state was completely falling apart leaving people facing homelessness and genuinely terrifying living standards; · - unemployment was something ridiculous like 8 million; · - we're arguably far more tolerant (some would say too tolerant) and educated than 70+ years ago; · - Communism has gone from being a genuine threat to your life in in Germany, to being reserved for Bond films and textbooks today; · - We have a far more stable government; · - We haven't lived through a horrifying bloodbath of a war; · - Other stuff I haven't though about.

Europe and the UK are still far more prosperous now than they were in the 1930s.

Also, the overall demographic of migrants in Europe today is overwhelmingly young, male, and competitive.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5805248_0013.18
The indigenous European population is more skewed towards the older (and female) demographic.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5805248_0013.19
Thus the Europeans are more likely to moan and groan than resort to violence and aggression (predominantly a young and male trait).

Also, significant proportions of the 20-35 male population in major European cities are migrant men.

Certainly immigration has increased competition, especially for low-paid, low-skilled work, and the reciprocal benefits have largely been taken advantage of by well-educated white-collar workers who have had more opportunities to develop themselves and learn multiple languages.
