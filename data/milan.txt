Many people aren't poor because they're lazy, they're poor because they had poor educational opportunities, or because they lack some of the talents required for a high salary, such as having a high intellect or strong people skills.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0125.3
More to the point, many people have disabilities or long term illnesses which harm their earning prospects.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0125.4
And some people are just unlucky, and end up with damaged prospects through no fault of their own (say if someone was born into a broken family with drug and alcohol problems, and ended up without the level of parental support required to succeed in education and then the workplace).
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0125.5
All of these things limit earning capacity, making people poor for reasons not of their own making.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0125.6
To then penalise these people by potentially allowing them to die if they become ill seems to me to be cruel and heartless beyond measure.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0125.7
Considering the low levels of social mobility in this country, and the increasing correlation between parental income and one's own income, you'd think that people might realise that some people are born with more social advantages than others, and thus can cope with misfortune more easily than others, say the cost of a major operation.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0125.8
I absolutely agree with you on the subject- what Americans fail to realise that there are are diseases that do not discriminate between poor and rich.

Besides, certain health conditions and injuries affect long term employment prospects, so some people get caught in a vicious circle- they can't work because they can't afford treatment, and they can't afford treatment because they don't work.

It reminds me of the story where a community decides to hire a private security force in their area, they then realise that they don't really need the police anymore and so lobby to reduce taxes going towards police.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0126.6
They are rich and powerful in politics so taxes are cut.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0126.7
Their community thrives but the community down the road slips into chaos as the police can't grapple with the crime due to the cuts.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0126.8
The richer community then points to the poorer community and says well if you weren't lazy and controlled crime you could improve your area, get more business and money then you might be able to hire a security force yourself.

Why wouldn't it mean the same when it is health care rather than food?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.4
The NHS led to immediate rationing, the long term effect of which has been that rich people opt out, and poor people die on waiting lists.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.5
On a market economy, if people want more of A and less of B, demand for A will go up and demand for B will fall.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.6
Sales of A will increase, and slaes of B will decrease, meaning more profits providing A and less providing B. This also means that providers of A will be able to raise their prices without losing sales, and supplies of B will have to drop theirs to keep sales.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.7
The raising prices and profits in the A industry will attract new suppliers into the industry, possibly from the B industry, where falling prices and profits are encouraging people to leave.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.8
The net result is that production of B declines and production of A rises.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.9
So the price mechanism allows those that want more of A to tell people to provide more of it, whilst giving them a proportionate incentive to respond appropriately, and allows people who want less of B to tell providers of B to produce less of it, and gives them a proportionate incentive to respond appropriately.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.10
Moreover, the same works for factors of production: How would land owners know that people wanted more bread, for instance?
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.11
The price and profit in the bread industry would rise as demand rises, telling bread makers to make more bread, or other producers to become bread makers.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.12
This causes a rise in the demand for wheat, with the same effect.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.13
This causes a rise in the demand for land, with the same effect.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.14
Abolishing, or interfering with this price mechanism, by fixing prices at zero, prevents this signalling process from happening.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.15
Consumers cannot signal to suppliers that more of one thing is needed and less of another, nor provide them with a proportionate incentive to respond.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.16
Whether or not health care proffessionals are in it for the money or for the basic desire to help, they cannot know which service people want more of.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.17
Fixing the price at zero means that demand will be higher than it would other wise be, that people will seek to get healthcare worth less to them than it costs to provide - the textbook definition of "over supplying."
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.18
The result of the whole debacle will be chronic shortages and missalocation of resources, coupled with special interest politics that will lead the NHS to be run for the benefit of those that work in it rather than those that use it.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.19
No it isn't.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.20
It is based on the idea that if you want something, you are entitled to go out and force people to give you money for it.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.22
But this is what people want the state to do to fund the NHS. It is based on the idea that people don't own themselves but should have to pay the state if they want to use their own body and mind to produce a living for themselves, so long as the state uses this money to buy everybody healthcare.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.23
It is based on the idea that it is OK to sacrifice one person to another.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.24
Of course it is socialist: It is collectively owned, not run for a profit, outside the market, supplying, in theory, "to each according to need."
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.25
Your comparison with food manufacture is flawed and misleading.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.26
The NHS does not prevent patient choice (one can choose to go private if preferred) it simply means the patient doesn't need to pay for that choice.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.27
The idea that this diminishes the practice of supply and demand is false; you cannot draw parallels between food consumption and healthcare, they are fundamentally different.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.28
Your argument that the NHS is based "on the idea that it is OK to sacrifice one person to another" and "that if you want something, you are entitled to go out and force people to give you money for it" is frankly, wrong.

You show negligible knowledge regarding taxation.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.30
Most people would accept that taxation is needed to secure the stability of the country, and to implement initiatives that cannot be brought about by the individual or by small parties and which require broader application by the state to be most effective.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.31
Therefore the state is not 'robbing' us; the taxpayer concedes that in the interests of good service,the healthcare system cannot be fragmented and subject to condition.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192453-5810289_0212.32

It's also possible that a huge bear (with rear footprints larger than I've ever seen in Alaska, including Kodiak Island, and without any sign of clawmarks) was walking bipedally (there was no evidence whatsoever of a front pawprint).

Great Dismal Swamp factoids:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.2
The Great Dismal Swamp is a marshy area on the Coastal Plain of southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina between Norfolk, Virginia, and Elizabeth City, North Carolina in the United States.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.3
It is located in parts of southern Chesapeake and Suffolk in Virginia, as well as northern Gates, Pasquotank, and Camden Counties in North Carolina.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.4
It is a southern swamp, one of many along the Atlantic Ocean's coast which includes the Everglades and the Big Cypress Swamp in Florida, the Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia, the Congaree Swamp and Four Holes swamps of South Carolina, and some of the Carolina bays in the Carolinas.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.5
Along the eastern edge runs the Dismal Swamp Canal, completed in 1805.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.6
Essential to the swamp ecosystem are its water resources, native vegetative communities, and varied wildlife species.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.7
The Great Dismal Swamp's ecological significance and its wealth of history and lore make it a unique wilderness.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.8
It is one of the last large and wild areas remaining in the Eastern United States.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.9
After centuries of logging and other human activities which were devastating the swamp's ecosystems, the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was created in 1973 when the Union Camp Corporation of Franklin, Virginia donated 49,100 acres (200 km²) of land; the refuge was officially established through The Dismal Swamp Act of 1974.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.10
The refuge consists of over 111,000 acres (500 km²) of forested wetlands.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.11
Lake Drummond, a 3,100 acre (13 km²) natural lake, is located in the heart of the swamp.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.12
Outside the boundaries of the National Refuge, the state of North Carolina has preserved and protected additional portions of the swamp, as the Great Dismal Swamp State Natural Area.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.13
Scientists believe the Great Dismal Swamp was created when the Continental shelf made its last big shift.

The whole swamp has peat underneath.

The origin of Lake Drummond, one of only two natural lakes in Virginia, is disputed.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.16
Scientists believe[citation needed] the lake could have been created by the impact of a meteoroid because it is oval shaped, looking like the impact of a meteoroid.

While all efforts to drain the swamp ultimately failed, logging of the swamp proved to be a successful commercial activity.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.22
Regular logging operations continued as late as 1976.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.23
Many areas have been burned by periodic wildfires.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.24
The Great Dismal Swamp has been drastically altered by humanity over the past two centuries.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.25
Agricultural, commercial, and residential development destroyed much of the swamp, so that the remaining portion within and around the refuge represents less than half of the original size.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.26
Before the refuge was established, over 140 miles (230 km) of roads were constructed to provide access to the timber.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.27
These roads severely disrupted the swamp's natural hydrology, as the ditches which were dug to provide soil for the road beds drained water from the swamp.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.28
The roads also blocked the flow of water across the swamp's surface, flooding some areas of the swamp with stagnant water.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.29
The logging operations removed natural stands of bald cypress and Atlantic white cypress that were replaced by other forest types, particularly red maple.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.30
A drier swamp and the suppression of wildfires, which once cleared the land for seed germination, created ecological conditions that were less favorable to the survival of cypress stands.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.31
As a result, plant and animal variety decreased.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.32
In the late 1990s, Prince Corporation heir Erik Prince spent part of his inherited wealth to purchase about 6,000 acres (24 km2) of the GDS to create a "state-of-the-art private training ground for shooters and security operators".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.33
[2] His private military contracting companyBlackwater Worldwideis named for the peat-colored water of the swamp.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.34
Also nearby are SEAL and Delta Force bases and the Blackwater facilities are rented out to various government agencies for SWAT team training.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.35
The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge is located not only between two states, but also between two eco-regions, allowing for a wide range of plant and animal species.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.36
Baldcypress, tupelo, maple, Atlantic white cypress, and pine are the predominant tree species found on the refuge and support the wildlife within.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.37
Many mammal species, including black bear, bobcat, otter, and weasel, along with over 70 species of reptiles and amphibians call the swamp home.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.38
More than 200 bird species can be seen at the swamp throughout the year, while 96 of those are known to nest on the refuge.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.39
Lake Drummond is the middle of activity in the swamp today with many fishermen, sightseers, and boaters.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.40
Camping is not allowed on the refuge but is allowed on the Lake Drummond Reservation (Corps of Engineers' site) which is located at the Feeder Ditch spillway.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0079.41
Access to this site is by boat only.

bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0082.1
Wow, good job William and great info on the swamp KK. Thanks so much.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.1
WGBH, given your description of this event, which preceded the sighting of the presumed bigfoot, I would like to submit the possibility that you were having a hypnagogic hallucination, which sometimes occur in conjunction with sleep paralysis.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.2
"Hypnagogia" is the transitional state between wakefulness and sleep.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.3
A hypnagogic hallucination is a dream that occurs between the REM (dream-) state and full wakefulness.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.4
Such hallucinations can and have been taken as real events in the minds of those who experience them.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.5
Sleep paralysis is a condition that sometimes occurs when the brain awakens from the REM (dream-) state, but body paralysis -- a natural part of the REM state -- persists.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.6
This conscious-yet-paralyzed state is sometimes accompanied by hypnagogic hallucinations and an acute sense of danger and panic.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.7
Distorted perceptions of one's surroundings, and imagined objects or beings, are known and documented elements of these paralyzed hallucinations.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.8
In the above-quoted report, you say you had not eaten that day and that you became weak and debilitated from nausea.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.9
You describe being "frozen...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.10
stuck there" prior to being "curled up in the fetal position" on the floor of the deer stand "for about five minutes".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.11
This sounds like a description of sleep paralysis.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.12
You also describe being alone in the woods for the first time in your life.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.13
"Sudden environmental change" is a factor that has been reported to increase the likelihood of sleep paralysis occurring.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.14
Others include:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.15
* Sleeping in a face upwards or supine position · * Irregular sleeping schedules; naps, sleeping in, sleep deprivation · * Increased stress · * Sudden environmental/lifestyle changes · * A lucid dream that immediately precedes the episode.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.16
WGBH, if you are interested in discovering what happened to you that night in 1982, and have an open mind on the subject, I invite you to look into sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations, and decide for yourself if the factors involved with this known and studied, but little understood, phenomenon, match your recollection of the events.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.17
It occurs to me that you might have witnessed a bear from the deer stand and, in your waking dream state, distorted the perception into a bigfoot, of which creature you have said you were aware from television.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.18
The feelings of panic and irrational danger that often accompany sleep paralysis have stuck with you all these years, and have led or contributed to on-going feelings of unease associated with the memory.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.19
From WebMD: · Over the centuries, symptoms of sleep paralysis have been described in many ways and often attributed to "evil" presences: unseen night demons in ancient times, the old hag in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and alien abductors.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.20
Almost every culture throughout history has had stories of shadowy evil creatures that terrify helpless humans at night.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.21
People have long sought explanations for this mysterious sleep-time paralysis and the accompanying feelings of terror.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.22
But sleep researchers now know that, in most cases, sleep paralysis is simply a sign that your body is not moving smoothly through the stages of sleep.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.23
Rarely is sleep paralysis linked to deep underlying psychiatric problems.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.24
I honestly hope this helps.

NOTE: I've relied on wikipedia's entries for the general wording of some of my descriptions of these conditions or phenomena, but the wiki entries are fully corroborated and supported by medical websites' descriptions and definitions of the terms as well.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.31
Also, I've written an unpublished novel in which the main character experiences sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.32
I mention this to explain how I've come to understand a little about these events beyond simply looking them up tonight on the internet.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.33
Vortigern,
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.34
I am at work this morning.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.35
If I had to make a knee jerk reaction, I would say it was not sleep paralysis.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.36
But I will study the information you provided closer when I get home tonight.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.37
I want to be fair to you and the fine research you put into it, so it does deserve a closer look when I have more time.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0149.38
Thank you so much for your effort.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0150.1
Just wanted to drop out of lurking and thank you guys for this thread.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0150.2
While these forums see quite a lot of discussions about the bigfoot phenomena it's very rare to read a first hand eyewitness report.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0150.3
I have little to add to the discussion though, but felt you it might be a good idea to remind you veterans that you teach us newbies something new every time.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0150.5
Good to see what kind of questions that are asked and what answers that are available.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0150.6
I can see why so many exotic explanations crop up to explain the elusive nature of the creature.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0150.7
It's a very troubling paradox for the eyewitnesses that they see something that they are sure is there, but is night impossible to explain rationally.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0150.8
How can such a large creature, apparently seen by quite a few people in the USA, somehow withstand every attempt to gather clear evidence for it's existance?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0150.9
I can understand why such an experience would be though to deal with.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0151.1
Xblade,
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0151.2
I am not going to answer condescending questions from people who accuse me of embellissing.

bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0151.4
Yawn.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0151.5
Excuse making from another footer.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0151.7
Just curious, can bigfoot fly in the latest version of your story?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0189.33
I've actually had a situation like that in the late 90s, and my observations would be that during the actual episode, it was VIVIDLY real, I would attribute mine in that moment to what you would hear described in a haunting, but upon awakening, just me, nevermore.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0189.34
Not that that is what happened with JC, just adding for a personal perspective.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0190.1
I tried to get them to come with me when I went to inspect the area where the animal had been standing, because I was so terrified.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0190.2
They wanted no part of it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0190.3
They had no interest in trying to confirm their own theory such as looking for bear tracks in that area?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.1
I usually just lurk around this site and having spent some time now reading this thread I feel the need to a least post just this one time on WGBH's behalf.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.2
Please keep in mind that this is only my opinion, based upon my own experiences with "bigfoot-like" creatures in the woods.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.4
John is pretty brave to be posting his experience on this site, for sure, and I am duly impressed at how well he is being treated here, for the most part.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.5
However, I just have to say that I think it is ludicrous for John to accept any other explanation for his encounter except for what it is.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.6
He saw a bigfoot-like creature.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.7
I believe him.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.8
I wrote a dissertation awhile back on the BFF, that I expounded on more in one of my blog writings, concerning the different personalities in the "bigfoot community".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.9
Part of it concerned the differences between "believers" and "knowers".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.10
The difference between John and some others is that John is a "knower", not a "believer".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.11
You can "believe" all the evidence (whether it is scientific or not) that you want, but until you have your own sighting, you can never be a "knower".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.12
Whether he likes it or not, John is in the class of "Knowers".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.13
Only those who "believe" in bigfoot will argue with a skeptic.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.14
Those that "know" these creatures exist won't waste their time.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.15
It is something like a Christian arguing with an Atheist about religion.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.16
It is a no-winner, for either side.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.17
I am not a amateur psychiatrist, like some folks here, however I truly believe that those that claim to have had hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations must be truly weak minded to believe that malarkey and to believe that it applies to John's experience.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.18
(Don't take it personal, I am not slamming anybody in particular).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.19
John may be weak willed, but he sure as hell is not weak minded.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.20
Anybody that has read his postings on the various forums/messages boards can attest to that.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.21
You guys have been so busy sharpening Occam's Razor in this thread that it has become a dull blade.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.22
John has posted his encounter.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.23
He has never wavered from what he has originally stated concerning his encounter.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.24
I think he has done a pretty good job, considering he was 17 when it happened.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.25
I am sure there could be more learned from him, however, his PTSD over the incident probably has closed his mind off to some of the events and he can't recall everything.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.26
One thing I would like to mention, that I hope John finds useful in his quest to unravel this mystery, is that based upon my own experiences with these creatures, I believe that John's encounter involved not one, but two creatures.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.27
These creatures hardly ever hunt singularly.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.28
They almost always tag-team.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.29
I am not sure what the purpose is when they are foraging for plant foodstuffs, unless one is supposed to stand watch while the other eats.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.30
When hunting live prey, one seems to always drive the prey into an ambush by the other.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.31
I find it doubtful, that the one that John saw, put "the stink" on him.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.32
There is no indication in John's report that the creature passed by his deer stand, before he stepped out in front of him.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.33
Given that John was guesstimating that the creature was approximately 50 yds in front of him, I find it doubtful that any smell was being given off from the creature that John could have smelled.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.34
I believe that the "stink" that John smelled probably came from the other creature that was hiding in the brush closer to the deer stand.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.35
(Oh, and speaking of the "stink" that John got a whiff of, just like a "creature sighting", there is no way a person can ever truly describe the "smell".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.36
It is like nothing you have ever smelled before and once you smell it, you will never forget it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.37
It will make your eyes water and can very well make you "sick to your stomach".)
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.38
I don't believe these creatures are harmful to humans, however, it is not the one you see in the woods that you should be worried about, it is his partner hiding behind you in the brush that should give you cause for reflection.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.40
I can only imagine how much more John's reaction would be if he ascertained that another creature was closer to the deer stand during his encounter.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.41
Of course, like I said earlier in this post, these are only my opinions, base upon my own experience with these creatures.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.42
I am not here to post about my experiences.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.43
Just to give John some "food for thought" concerning his own encounter.

The only other thing that I would tell John is that I wouldn't let a bad experience when I was 17 keep me from going out and having some fun in the woods.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.45
I think you should buck up, go out into the woods, find the sucker and kick him in the ass!
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0310.47
So i am considered by you to be "truly weak minded" well that's a confident statement from someone that considers himself to be "not even an amateur psychiatrist"
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0311.1
Everyone who has been asking me to describe the smell, Pywacket just described it very well.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0311.2
I am sorry, I need to take a break from answering these questions right now.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0311.3
No one has done anything wrong, my health is not good at the moment.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0311.4
I apologize and I thank you for being kind.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0311.5
I will be OK soon and return.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0311.6
Take care of yourself dude

Why would Billy be mad at you for going alone?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.2
Shouldn't he be freaking out with happiness?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.3
I was just at the most stunning lake and as I was heading into the area I checked a sign board with some info about the lake.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.4
There was a notice that a huge black bear had been seen on one of the trails only three days before.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.5
We found a women's sunglasses (kinda big with sequins on them) and keys there.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.6
We were wondering how they got there and joked we might see the bear coughing out a hair extension and a broken Beyoncé CD.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.7
It's like the whole general discussion section and the research section Basically everywhere that I was regularly posting in and one of the people whom I was respectfully and civilly interacting with and who do not mind polite and reasonable skeptics might ask where the heck I went.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.8
Wouldn't that be weird to remove from public view the entire general discussion section as well as the research section?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.9
Also weird that they never returned my email seeking clarification on the nature of my removal.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.10
Oh well.

Luckily I saved many of my posts there to my email for future refence.

I realized when I had a post removed from a thread on the Freeman cast collection politely asking why we could not discuss whether or not we thought the casts from an admitted hoaxer were legitmate that I was in a highly bizarre situation with a Bigfoot enthusiast (Melissa) behaving very weirdly:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.18
That's fine, though.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.19
I knew she was very irritated and wanted me gone.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.20
She cheerleaded Lyndon when he showed up to debate with me and then when he said he gave up and didn't feel like staying she really seemed irritated.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.21
That's what happens when you are heavily biased and can't handle healthy discussion and debate regarding a simple black and white zoological question.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.22
Anyway, this is OT.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.23
I will discuss it more in an appropriate thread.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.24
I literally thought when I was at those falls that John would go nuts if he could see this place.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.25
It was PNW rainforest on steroids.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0356.26
I Thought that the PNW consists of temperate Rainforests only?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0357.2
You thought wrong, and you didn't do any research.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0357.3
First we need to know what you consider to be the PNW.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0358.9
Billy just worries about me because he has seen me freak out in the woods plenty of times.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0358.10
I am sure deep down he is happy, but he wants me to understand I should not go out alone as inexperienced and scared as I am.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0358.11
When I told him it was just a park he calmed down.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0359.1
Billy was right.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0359.2
NC is a bear hotspot and the big ones are near the coast.

"The next morning I decided to stalk the bear," Rose said.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0359.5
"I used cover along ditches to sneak to the field.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0359.6
I shot the bear with a.270 at 175 yards."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0359.7
The bear weighed 635 pounds.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0359.8
After drying, the skull scored 21, making the All-Time Boone and Crockett record book.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0359.9
"The bear was a short distance from Dismal Swamp Refuge," Rose said.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0359.10
"That may have helped him get so big."

Robert Norville is the commission's District 2 wildlife biologist.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0359.12
Norville said the biggest bears in the state occur along the Pamlico County-Beaufort County line.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0359.13
"I remember last year one party brought in a pair of bears that were almost identical and the bears weighed around 450 pounds each," Norville said.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0359.14
"One we checked at the Pamlico-Beaufort line weighed over 600 pounds.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0359.15
For the largest bears in the state, Hyde and Beaufort counties have been swapping bragging rights during recent seasons."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0359.16
As good as the mountain hunting can be, hunters kill more bears in the coastal region, and bear weights are also heavier.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0360.1
I would vote that an inexperienced kid got sick in the woods and collapsed, and when he began to recover he saw a big bear standing up and feeding in the distance and blew it out of proportion from being scared and sick and worried and a bit confused about what happened to him.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0361.1
Apparently one of the biggest American Black Bears ever recorded was a male from North Carolina that weighed 400 kilograms...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0362.2
Interesting fact.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0362.3
I would not have thought that.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0362.4
Most of the black bears I have seen in VA and NC have been small.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0362.5
Now the ones in PA were huge and more prevalent.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0363.1
Or WGBH could have seen a Bigfoot.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0363.2
He either saw it or he did not see it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0363.3
Lets focus on both explanations.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0561.1
I was born and raised in Scioto County Ohio on a large farm in a very rural area near the Shawnee State Forest and do not recall any sightings.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0561.2
All of us boys roamed the woods both hunting and just for fun; in the winter with the snow on a favorite game was to let someone have a 10 minute head start and then track him.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0561.3
We never saw BF tracks.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0561.4
In no way was I relating bear sightings to bf sightings.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0561.5
I was just commenting on Kitakaze's question "Where are bears?"
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0561.6
My family has spent upteen thousand hours in Washington county woods and no bf there either.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0561.7
Or bear.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0561.8
I like to hear about species returning to areas and I know many interested in "bf like" stuff do to.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0561.9

bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0561.12
But what I have said I stand behind.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0561.13
What about Archangels proposal?

bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0562.1
So nothing solid regarding cougars (though there are bobcats which people could mistake for cougars).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0562.2
As for the wolves, how reliable is that information you have regarding the shot dead animals?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0562.3
If confirmed that would be an example of an extirpated species returning to an area it once inhabited.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0562.4
I think you might agree this is a very far cry from massive undiscovered wood apes loping about Salt Fork State Park tossing rocks over by where the pavilion is, would you not?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0562.5
wolves bodies are i dep hands, guess that depends how paranoid you are
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0563.6
I have heard the same from many friends who live there in Ohio.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0563.7
There are not that many bear sightings.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0563.8
We see lots of bear here in VA and in NC. When I went to PA we saw bears everywhere.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0563.13
No worries and no need to apologize.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0563.16
What was archangels proposal?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0563.17
I guess I need to scroll up and read it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0563.18
Edit: I scrolled up about 4 pages and could not find it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0564.4
It was shown on the page just before this one.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0564.5
Here it is again:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0564.6
Actually, just to clarify my position I have no idea what he smelled and don't want to say that it might've emanated from a bear.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0564.7
I just feel that a physical source of odour cannot be ruled out as less likely than a hallucinated one.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0564.8
I do have to ask for some clarification from someone who knows the area in question, the swamps I've been to here in Australia all smell bloody awful for the most part does the one in question have a similar sort of odour?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0564.9
As I understand it the odour that occurs in swamps can be attributed to the rotting vegetation and animals, coupled with the moistness of the area.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0564.10
The rotting process can lead to build ups of noxious smelling gases, especially if trapped under the usual layer of mud that is in a swamp.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0564.11
If expelled this could create a small pocket of less oxygenated air, which could potentially have a foul smell (ie swamp gas).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0564.12
The lack of oxygen in the area could bring on some of the symptoms that WGBH described (ie nausea etc) and if he was feeling faint enough it's also possible that he may have started to hallucinate things.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0564.13
It could also explain why the rest of the group did not smell anything by the time they got back, it had dissipated.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0564.14
Note: · I'm not claiming this is what happened, nor that it's even likely just that it might be another possible explanation.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0565.3
Ah, I missed that, I must have been hallucinating.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0565.5
Thanks for that Kit.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0565.6
We were not in the swamp proper but the property was near the border.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0565.7
Nevertheless, The smell did have a bit of that swampy methane odor mixed in with the wet dog,rotting flesh smell.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0565.8
Did I smell swamp gas and hallucinate?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0565.9
I would answer that the same way I have the other theory's submitted.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0565.10
Anything is possible, but I find it unlikely.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0565.11
I will admit that it is more likely then a sleep or brain disorder.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0565.12
I guess this is another thing I ask the park officials if I can ever get down there.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0565.13
We are getting swamped (pun intended) at work and it is hard for me to get away.

Hello John I've been over to your site and bringing your encounter here while not the easiest place in the world to navigate through the personalities is not a place where kindness in the form of humoring as a kindness is going to fill you up with empty calories.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.6
Whatever calories of knowledge you get will be the kind that will give valid energy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.7
I do not look for kindness here Crow.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.8
I look for ideas.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.9
I do not fear what their opinions are.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.10
While I've never seen a Sasquatch and have grave reservations that they managed to hold on into the last quarter of the 20th century maybe they did, apparently your's did at least.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.11
Perhaps you did see a bipedal unclassified ape munching leaves in the forest.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.12
After all if it lives it eats.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.13
The only point I have contention is the overall size of the creature.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.14
For decades I simply took at face value the size reports.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.15
Some of which you know are simply stupendously big.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.16
However I took the time recently to scale some sasquatch to various sized and when I brought up a 12 ft sasquatch next to a 5'9" man it became clear to me that anything that big would be cutting a pretty wide swath through its environment.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.17
So my only question is was it really that big?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.18
Do you think your 9 footer may have been somewhat smaller say 7'-8' which is still huge.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.19
I saw what I saw.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.20
No I am very sure it was well above 8 ft and probably 9 ft. I played soccer for 20 years.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.21
A soccer goal is 8 ft. It was well beyond that.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.22
I could see where its head was compared to the tree.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.23
Also there has been issue with the amount of detail you may have seen at 50 yards.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.24
I don't have any issues at all with the details you may have seen.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.25
50 yards is 150 ft. The driveway leading up to my studio loft is 50 yards long.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.26
From there I can easily make out details passersby in the street.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.27
150' is not a huge distance by any means.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.28
Also you saw that animal through 17 year old eyes.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.29
At 17 my eyes were pretty sharp.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.30
I suspect that the majority of posters here are considerable older than 17 and it is unfair for shall we say middle agers 35-55yrs to discount what a pair pair of 17 year old eyes are capable of seeing at 150'.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.31
There were details I could not see very well Crow.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.32
Such as the eyes and the fingernails.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.33
Also, It may have been less then 50 yds. It was just an estimate and I was 10 ft up in a tree, so that could make it seem farther then it was.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.34
I could see the back, shoulders, arms and hands well.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.35
My eyes were always sharp.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.36
I just started wearing glasses two years ago and I am 44.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.37
Basically that's about all I wanted to say.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.38
I hope in the end this forum and your own research helps to sort it out for you.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0594.39

Is there some kind of award we can bestow on you when you do yet another terrific and so ******* funny job of repulsing those pesky (but) ProBigfooters?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0595.7
Seriously, your craftsmanship is impeccable.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0595.8
The fact you still have WGBH's 'attention' is surprising, even if obvious why. I mean (and I mean it respectfully), he's still stalled on 'he saw Bigfoot'.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0595.9
Actually, it is true that WGBH has transformed (and possibly redeemed) himself from a literal BFF 'forum troll' to an almost famous and esteemed member of the entire Bigfoot Community, pro and con.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0595.10
Gotta respect that.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0595.11
Maybe when WGBH finally does realize there is no Bigfoot, and he will, Kitakaze will be first in line for yet another of those awards we decided in the paragraph above to regularly give him?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0595.12
We can only pray.

I wasn't aware I was being mean or nasty to you.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.2
I can pull up the many compliments and words of support I've been offering you but I don't think I'll find anything mean or nasty.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.3
That is the problem Kit, you can't even recognize the hurtful things you say.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.4
Before you ask me to "prove my claims" by copying and pasting them, I am not interested in that argument, I can deal with it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.5
You know when I lost my temper and why I did it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.6
I told you right here on this forum.

Don't play coy.

I posted that quote on SFB in a attempt to diffuse a situation that Crow may have started that I did not want.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.9
I was making light of the situation by saying I am OK and I can handle myself here on the JREF fine.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.10
That is all I intended.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.11
It was not a attack on you and it was a mistake to use your name.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.12
I don't believe that not thinking you really saw a 9 x 6 ft monster wood ape amidst the civilization of the Virginia/North Carolina state line qualifies as being mean or nasty.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.13
I mean, c'mon.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.14
Look at the place we're talking about.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.15

Your comment at SFB really doesn't seem fair to me.

I understand, but see my above comment.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.21
I'm a little let down that you would speak that way about me when I'm not around.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.22
I've liked you since we first got into constructive debate at you SFB and you told Melissa and others to chill out and realize I'm not trying to be insulting or make things personal when I am debating Bigfoot issues.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.23
But you are not around there Kit.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.24
You were thrown out for behavior not wanted on that forum by its owner.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.25
The fact that you or I may not agree with those rules is not the point.

You have no idea how many times I attempted to defuse the situation regarding you and the rest of the admin.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.28
I argued on your behalf on the admin forums constantly.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.29
Only for you to turn around and do the same things you were warned about again and again.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.30
You took it out of my hands Kit.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0795.31

Yes, and you guys at back-to-sleepy SFB can split your PGF Munns thread into a "whine about JREF skeptics" thread.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.3
You're right.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.4
All my stuff about SFB/ABS/Melissa and friends is pretty OT.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.5
I don't feel particularly bad about it because whenever I try to discuss why you couldn't have had a sleep-related occurence or distorted memory we get about as far as "I saw what I saw".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.6
You and everyone here can discuss your opinions about my encounter all you want.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.7
I listen to all of them, but I am not required to subscribe to them.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.8
If there's any complaint, I could maybe try something lame and say "well didn't the ABS think they might have seen Bigfoot eyeshine?"
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.9
The key word there is "might".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.10
Eyeshine is not proof.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.11
And we do not · submit it is such.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.12
You are confusing someone telling about a experience on a radio show as submitting it as evidence.

Speaking of lame.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.14
I know, not much finesse.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.15
What I find frustrating about situations like this is that I have a conflict between not wanting to be OT (even in a more open thread like this) and adding yet another Bigfoot thread to the pile while more than a few are active.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.16
With all the silliness that happened with Bullet Maker doing a lemming run off the face of Bigfootery, I've kind of been giving poor Darren Lee and the MABRC a break and Melissa and friends kookery have put the ABS in my sights, particularly with what a gong show the SFSP expedition was.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.17
May be I will start a thread similar to my MABRC threads and call it "American Bigfoot Society - The Mild Bunch."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.18
If I do, I expect you to do a good job handing it back to the "scoftics".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.20
Kit one of the first things you and I ever spoke about regarding Bigfoot was Mr Bilby and his hoaxing.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.21
You do understand that most in this field never bought into anything he said or did, correct?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.22
He admitted hoaxing to me, · I posted it for all to see, and he is done and good riddence.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.23
Please do not infer that the ABS has anything to do with hoaxing by comparing us to Bullet maker.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.24
That is really crossing a line.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.25
You know that none of us in the ABS will stand for hoaxing.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0916.26

bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.2
Yes, John, I did pick and choose what posts I put in my response.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.3
Maybe it had something to do with the fact that all of those posts by other members who weren't skeptics and were making reference to Paul Freeman's hoaxing preceeded any post that I and then HarryH made.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.4

Your claim:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.7
"The people who were commenting about hoaxing from the beginning were you and other sceptics..."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.8
Oops for you.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.9
That wasn't true, was it, John?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.10
Shall I post the post numbers and exact times and dates that those Bigfoot enthusiasts like Henry May, Creekfreak, and Reverend Stone made those posts so you can see exactly how long before my and Harry's comments they were?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.11
I would just tell any person who isn't banned to just go over and see for themselves but uh oh, Melissa turtled her board and put all new accounts on preview.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.12

They were not disrupting the thread like you were.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.15
I should have said disrupting and not commenting.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.16
Strone only said he will make up his own mind and did not mention hoaxing.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.17
And I find it hilarious that you would quote and use Creek Freak to defend yourself, especially since you attack him constantly for being a hoaxer.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.18
So I guess that we can say that YOU support a hoaxer too right Kit?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.19
Hypocrite.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.20
So that leaves Henry and he only mentioned it, he did not disrupt the thread.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.21
You mean another Bigfoot enthusiast who posts in another Bigfoot board felt uncomfortable with me pointing out exactly what such a massive collection of casts by Freeman implied?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.22
For example, that he would have casted at least 26 individual Bigfoots in his small area alone?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.23
No I mean an administrator from the largest Bigfoot forum noticed you acting like a troll as you normally do.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.24
Being warned by a Bigfoot enthusiast groupie for pointing out the obvious in a civil manner in discussion where the comments are perfectly relevant worries me not.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.25
And acting like a troll, scoftic will get you banned, and it did.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.26
Actually no.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.27
John.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.28
I'm simply pointing out that your claim that no ABS member tolerates hoaxers is simply a fantasy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.29
It's not about whether or not casts are evidence of Bigfoot.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.30
That's solely your opinion, not in line with that of Meldrum, Melissa, and a throng of other Bigfooters, and a diversion tactic to try and steer away the conversation from your claim.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.31
It is all about opinion and yours is no more relevent then anyones.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.32
including mine, silly boy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.33
I don't think it was a travesty that Melissa kicked me out.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.34
Neither do most of the members there.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.36
Says the guy who repeatedly ignores requests to address the simplest questions regarding his sighting while engaging in the topic he complained about as OT.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.37
I've lost count how many times John ignores this:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.38
You are confusing ignore for disregard.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.39
Go ahead and ignore me, John.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0932.40
OK
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0933.1
John- You abstained from voting for the banning of Kitakaze.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0933.2
And you act like it was a gesture to show that you didn't really want him banned.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0933.3
I'm just curious what your voting record is on past bannings.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0933.4
Have you voted to ban people before?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0933.5
, Have you abstained before?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0933.6
, Have you voted not to ban people before?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0933.7
Abstaining from voting in this case, might be a big deal if you always vote yes or no, on banning, but it wouldn't be a big deal if you ALWAYS abstain from voting for banning.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0933.8
NOWHATIMEAN?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0934.1
It doesn't sound like you're saying you were the one that lifeted Bateman's art.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0934.2
BTW, this is not the first time there's been an issue about Melissa's site using art without permission, is it?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0934.3
That's rhetorical, you don't have to answer.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0934.4
What I know is that it ended up being a major league catfight for many people myself included and I wasted mucho energy trying to stay out of it last year so thats about my input on it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0934.5
I won't go even more OT with MABRC or NESRA stuff but I really like the head of your group, Chris Bartow.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0934.6
I've had friendly and helpful discussions with him in the past.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0934.7
Actually Chris is one of four board members for the Group, as am I just to clarify but i appreciate you not dragging Nesra into this subject, it really has nothing to do with them.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0934.8
Matters with Anderholm are considered ancient history also, fwiw.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0935.9
It was not in support of his troll behavior.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0935.10
I just do not support banning anyone and would not do it unless someone threatens another member.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0935.11
I was content to just edit his posts.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0935.12
Some people do not have the patience for that and he was banned.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0935.13
I have not been involved with any other ban of a member there,we have not had any since I was a Mod or Admin.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0935.14
The majority of the members can behave like adults.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0936.1
Kitz, are you banned from the bff?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185510-351190_0936.2

Great post!!!!!

That selective outrage is simply a psychological mechanism.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0119.8
As they used to say in journalism school: to determine the importance of a story, divide the distance through the number of casualties.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0119.9

Of course one man's conspiracy is another man's reasonable political and economic maneuver, but the cigarette thing is pretty ridiculous.

Dontcha' think so Greg?.......
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.3
The stats are beyond grim;
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.4
1) Around 5.4 million deaths a year are caused by tobacco.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.5
2) Smoking is set to kill 6.5 million people in 2015 and 8.3 million humans in 2030, with the biggest rise in low-and middle-income countries.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.6
3) Every 6.5 seconds a current or former smoker dies, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.7
4) An estimated 1.3 billion people are smokers worldwide (WHO).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.8
5) Over 443,000 Americans (over 18 percent of all deaths) die because of smoking each year.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.9
Secondhand smoke kills about 50,000 of them.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.10
6) 1.2 million people in China die because of smoking each year.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.11
That's 2,000 people a day.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.12
7) Tobacco use will kill 1 billion people in the 21st century if current smoking trends continue.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.13
8) 33 percent to 50 percent of all smokers are killed by their habit.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.14
9) Smokers die on average 15 years sooner than nonsmokers.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.15
Sometimes the conspirators don't congregate and plot in smoked filled rooms, rather, they simply pretend nothing is going on.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.16
Some are so stupid like the members of the US Congress/US Senate.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.17
They did/do not even realize their actions, in this case subsidizing the tobacco industry, resulted in so many American deaths.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.18
And those poor poor poor farmers, needing all that subsidizing, and then the buyout to boot(buyout occurred in 2004), growing cyanide as it were, and here we didn't know cigarettes were deadly until the 1950s.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.19
That's not much warning now is it?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.20
Now how many Americans was it that died in the Civil War?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.21
625,000....
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.22
somptin' like that.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.23
WWI 117,000, WWII 400,000, Korea 36,000 Vietnam 58,000......
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.24
Total American deaths due to war since 1775 2,500,000.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.25
So let's see there, 400,000 cigarette related deaths in the US a year, so every six years roughly stoggies kill as many Americans as all US wars combined did.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.26
Every three years stoggies killed as many Americans as did the Civil War, WWI, WWII, the Korean War, the war in Vietnam.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.27
Pretty dang good population control on the part of the US senate wouldn't ya' say?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0121.28
Yeah, it did start to get pretty dang obvious, the "murder pays" MO as it related to cigarettes, so eventually taking the show on the road did make eminent sense......

Interesting.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0205.3
24 didn't involve the Illuminati or aliens so according to some here, no conspiracies.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0205.4
Seems like when someone shows a conspiracy that came true, others downplay as not sufficient, but things like MK-Ultra are as big a conspiracy theory as covering up alien encounters though the alien thing would be more significant.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0205.5
As far as 9/11, what do some mean by conspiracy theory?

bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0205.7
Then not so likely.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0205.8
That there was a 24-style cover-up because some conspiratorial elements or agents within the US government helped facilitate it?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0205.9
Believe it or not, that's entirely feasible and entirely likely the powers that be would think this is not something we can have come out for the good of the nation and international affairs.

The existence of the Trilateral Commission, and of its project to halt radical political movements around the world and restore a kind of liberal-authoritarian stability, are documented facts of history.

People might be forgiven in the 1970s for not having easy access to those documents, but today you can download them from the Commission's own web site so there's really no excuse.

The Courageous Italian Judge Felice Casson Was Responsible for the uncovering of "Gladio", the Italian Secret Army.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0207.2
Once Casson got the goods on those naughty naughty naughty little boys, then the Italian Prime Minister, Giulio Andreotti had to say something, confess in a sense.

So there Greg, the NATO SECRET ARMY CONSPIRACY, a conspiracy that endured from 1945 through 1990, 45 years, with activities that included the murdering of innocent people, including children, to create fear in the hearts of Europeans so US military interests could park nukes in the Europeans' front yards.

They are often dismissed as conspiracy theories but such conspiracies are actually part of the fabric of history and something people need to accept and understand as not some wacko concept but how things get done sometimes.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0208.3
It's a conspiracy theory because the press chose not to report on it, at a time when there weren't many ways to get around press silence.

They are almost never encountered because people who know the truth will tell someone.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0275.23
They will take photos of dead aliens, they will record their friends telephone conversations they will make a deal with the prosecutors to avoid prison or get shorter terms in prison.

bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0323.13
It's much more believable these were things that happened because governments or the CIA or something else official had lost control over the elements of Operation Gladio that they initially created.

We all agree that Operation Gladio was atrocious, but what exactly is the conspiracy claim claim here?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0323.15
What exactly makes it 'like' a conspiracy theory?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0323.16
What exactly is it that makes its discovery like a conspiracy theory that got found out?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0324.9
Denial......
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0324.10
It was acknowledged, at least in some sense, as a NATO operation....

Who is the fattest cat in NATO?......

Many conspiracies are broad in scope by necessity.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0325.2
Too broad and violate to be associated with a specific protagonist(s).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0325.3
As in the rich in America are getting richer but nobody seems to be able to do what is necessary to reverse that trend.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0325.4
In other words there are three intertwined conspiracies.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0325.5
One conspiracy that has enabled the rich to become richer.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0325.6
A second conspiracy to keep the rich getting richer.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0325.7
A third conspiracy to keep anyone from reversing what is enabling the rich to keep getting richer.

In any case, prior to the uncovering of Gladio, I have not seen evidence of any Conspiracy Theory surmizing it's existence.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0326.10
ETA: plus the existence of Gladio does not prove that any other CT is correct.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0330.1
In an attempt to answer what I think you're question really is.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0330.2
A lot of people aren't aware of these things but, for the JFK assassination...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0330.3
there was an actual government commission that in fact said there was likely a conspiracy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0330.4
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_Assassinations">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_...Assassinations</a>
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0330.5
Also Martin Luther King,again many people are unaware of this, but his family won a civil lawsuit saying there was indeed a conspiracy to kill MLK.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0330.6
<a href="http://actofstate.org/">http://actofstate.org/</a> I think the fact that his own family doesn't even believe the official story is pretty telling.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0330.7
I hope this is something like the answers you were looking for.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0330.8
The HSCA's case rests on the acoustic evidence which was recorded after the assassination so they really have no case at all.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0330.9
As for King, a civil suit isn't the same thing as a criminal charge, for which no agency could ever find any evidence against Lloyd Jowers.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0330.10
They must be in on it too.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0330.11
Then why did they let the civil suit proceed?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0330.12
Ohh they are clever.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0330.13
I don't really care what King's family thinks.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0330.14
There are plenty of mothers in the world who don't believe their sweet little boys could ever grow up to be axe-murderers either but that don't make it so.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0331.1
I do not think it is the same.....
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0331.2
I am presuming John Albert reserves the tern "Conspiracy Theory" for nutty unverifiable stuff.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0331.3
Gladio is a different story so I am imagining that he would call it something else, though I do not know that for a fact, as obviously once upon a time "Gladio" was a "conspiracy theory" in the pejoritive sense of the term, with only a courageous lone Italian judge as its proponent, simply wondering and speculating and then of course ultimately bringing down the house, but that would be later.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0331.4
Most utlimately proven to be true bona fide false flag operations, must start out as some guy's "nutty idea", some guy's ridiculous conspiracy theory.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0331.5
Your "courageous lone Italian judge" uncoverd Gladio as part of a criminal investigation, not because of a "conspiracy theory".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0332.1
Even assuming a conspiracy theory were true it isn't likely to be proven by a conspiracy theorist.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0332.2
The mindset works against the kind of patient evidence gathering and careful investigation required to break something like Watergate.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0332.3
They are always looking for the 'smoking gun', that one piece of perfect evidence that will blow the other side away.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0332.4
If they think they have one they latch on to it for dear life and refuse to let go even when they're shown to be embarrassingly wrong; discrediting themselves and whichever conspiracy they're advocating in the process.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0332.5
Watergate was silly, that was no crime......
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0332.6
Big deal, Nixon was capable of and in fact did do plenty worse in 6th grade during recess.....
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0333.2
He was the man though, it was for the most part one guy against many.....
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0333.3
Not that he had no help, but it was one guy's vision/insight that made this happen, one guy against some low life NATO thugs.....
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0334.2
A criminal investigation was a big part in the uncovering of Watergate...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.5
My point is not that your description of Gladio is wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.6
It is certainly correct.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.7
My point is that it is so different from the other things that this term describes that you can't can't use the same term for both of them.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.8
Gladio was a conspiracy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.9
This is true.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.10
It was a clandestine government black op.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.12
It was covert.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.14
But to call it a a Conspiracy Theory that was in fact true would be wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.15
It was never denied by anyone.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.16
Its mechanisms are well understood.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.17
People involved in it are obvious.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.18
Once it was in the open, its mechanism became apparent to anyone with the appropriate background.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.19
We're certainly not sitting her 10 years later arguing about whether or not it happened.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.20
So it may be a conspiracy in Patrick-talk, but what's the word we're going to use for 9/11 Truth?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0335.21
And if it's not "conspiracy theory", you're going to have to go around and ask millions of people to stop using the term.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0336.1
The conspiracy to get Ward Churchill fired for dissenting from Bush's post-9/11 propaganda.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0336.2
Circumstantially evident almost immediately and ultimately proven to the satisfaction of a jury.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0336.3
Still quite difficult for a lot of people to accept.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0337.4
I am quite unfamiliar with this case.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0337.5
The Great Wiki states Churchill sued for wrongful dismissal and won.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0337.6
What does that have to do with anything here?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0337.7
It appears to me this is clearly a procedural dispute.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.1
I think this is a very interesting idea.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.2
It is conceptually linked to many of the points I have stated as to why various events are NOT conspiracy theories.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.3
Some of the most significant are,
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.4
1. Are these events for which the structure of participation is obvious once the event is identified?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.5
2. Has the problem become structured so that it is a conspiracy theory?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.6
3. Are these opinions separated by differences in attitude and value but not facts?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.7
It seems that Watergate falls into category (1).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.8
I was 12 when Watergate occurred and am not well read on the events.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.9
My understanding is that there was some confusion in the beginning about the details of the break-in but once these were identified, it was clear who had to be responsible.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.10
My understanding is that there never was a long chain of denials.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.11
It was just obvious what had happened once the details were clear.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.12
This whole thing about smoking is important because it illustrates how conspiracy theories get started.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.13
I am unaware of a time when people who actually had knowledge about tobacco and cancer believed this.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.14
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_tobacco#History">Great Wiki</a> describes tells us,
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.15
While cigarette companies may have denied it, it was hardly a conspiracy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.16
They were simply lying about something that informed people always knew about.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.17
If this is a conspiracy theory, then so is any health claim that turns out to be true or false.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.18
In fact, it makes me think that any scientific claim misunderstood by the public and misrepresented by anyone would also have to be a conspiracy theory.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.19
In fact, there are people who believe hemp, laetrile, and Orgone energy can be used to cure cancer and that an Official Conspiracy Theory is hiding this.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.20
They use the example of tobacco as their version of 'proof' that they are correct.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.21
So at least some people agree with you.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.22
The example of wartime rumours is quite interesting.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.23
It is analogous to the claims made by 9/11 Truth advocates.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.24
This is probably the example that is most problematic for me so far and I should think about it more before I say something.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.25
But why wait...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.26
this is the JREF...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.27
In fact, the of wartime rumours as conspiracy theories is very useful in showing what I mean by a conspiracy theory.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.28
Even after the war is over, it's hard to sort out what did and didn't happen a certain way.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.29
Would that mean that a conspiracy theory is just a rumour that's confusing and hard to sort out?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.30
I tend to agree with this.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.31
I don't know anything about astronomy and optics and as a result, I get very confused listening to lunar landing conspiracy stuff.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.32
If I were living in wartime Britain, I would be equally (un)informed about the secret plans of the Allied Powers to attack Normandy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.33
Anything I hear could be convincing and even the fact of the invasion wouldn't help me addresses most of the claims I'd have heard about the invasion plans.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.34
So is a conspiracy theory a rumour that is so technical in its details that almost no one can understand it's true?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.35
That would be one aspect of it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.36
Is a conspiracy theory a rumour about an event so complex that even the factual matters of the event are so complex and poorly documented that after the fact, many things continue to remain unclear?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.37
That would be another aspect of it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.38
This is probably the line of reasoning that lead Noam Chomsky to call 9/11 Truth claims an "internet rumour."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.39
Are conspiracy theories just rumours?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.40
So that if a rumour ended up being true, that would be the same thing as a conspiracy theory that ended up being true?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.41
So if the rumour about Suzie's affair with John ends up being true, even after I defended John as a highly moral guy who was with me when the story says he was with Suzie, is that a conspiracy theory that ends up being true?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.42
Or does a conspiracy theory have to be a rumour about important people and stuff like that?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.43
But didn't we talk about all this before?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.44
Just some thoughts on this?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.45
So what you're saying there are no conspiracies.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.46
Or you're saying that once something becomes known it was never a conspiracy anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0361.47
Seems to me, that to get things to "go your way and/or profit at the expense of others," conspiracies are absolutely necessary.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0362.1
Watergate had a slow drip drip of what where originally rumors and innuendo that lasted 2 years.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0362.2
There was a convoluted pathway from the break in to the president with multiple denials lies and excuses.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0362.3
It even had a shadowy figure in Deep Throat who turned out to be a high level FBI informer.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0362.4
It had document shredding to hide the truth.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0362.5
W&B also reported some of their sources being scared to talk and under surveillance.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0362.6
If you take conspiracy to mean a group of people working together to a single secret end then it was certainly a conspiracy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0362.7
If W&B had an idea that the official story was untrue then they had a theory about the conspiracy that eventually proved true.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0362.8
I still contend that if this forum existed then there would be posts discussing the slow leak of information as a CT at the time.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185516-352664_0362.9
A CT doesn't have to be a woo NWO bad Sciencey type thing, although these are the ones that tend to be regarded as 'true' CTs, ones that are almost fictionalised stories about something.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.1
Americans and foreigners of the muslim faith were murdered on 9/11.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.2
These muslims are as much victims of the islamist terrorists as all the others, the Christians, the Jews, the Hindus, the Atheists.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.3
Muslims in lower Manhattan go to a mosque or prayer room there, because that's where they live ot work.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.4
These Muslims are New Yorkers!
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.5
Just like all the others: The Christians, the Jews, the Hindus, the Atheists.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.6
When the planes crashed, when the towers fell, there were tens of thousands of muslim New Yorkers in downtown Manhattan, very nearly becoming victims of the atrocities.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.7
Now Chewy_Defense wants to make these New Yorkers, these victims of 9/11, victims again.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.8
Victims of past terrorists, and victims of future terrorists.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.9
Up to this point, excellent post.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.10
From this point on, crap.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.11
Chewy_Defense seems to hate the freedom that the Constitution grants to all Americans.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.12
Bull.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.13
He's shown no signs of hating anyone or anything.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.14
He respects Constitutional freedoms but sees possible harm to NYC should the full extent of those freedoms be exercised by building this Muslim complex.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.15
Like you, I think he is 100% wrong but all he is doing is expressing the fact that his values within those freedoms indicate a different course of action.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.16
That's all.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.17
Chewy_Defense wants the terrorists to win.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.18
It's like he allows them to piss on the graves of muslim New Yorkers.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.19
More bull.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.20
He does not want the terrorists to win and your just throwing flame bait to make the claim.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.21
He identifies one possible harm and wants to minimize the chances of that happening.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.22
Now you and I disagree with him on the potential of that happening and the concomitant damage that will occur if his solution is implemented but that in no way implies his desire for a terrorist victory.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0300.23
Shame on you.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0301.1
I'm still waiting for JihadJane's answer, as to why Al Qaeda attacked the USA on 9-11-01.

Maybe I should have split the two parts.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0303.14
The latter is mocking Chewy's "arguments".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0304.4
I do.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0304.5
More or less.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185517-393516_0304.6
I'd explicitly mention US support for non-democracies like the monarchies of Saudi-Arabia, Jordan, Morocco, or the de-facto-dictatorship of Egypt.

They attacked in large part because of (A) USA's relationship/defense of Israel, and (B) the perceived USA Invasion, both Physically (as seen in Kuwait) and mentally of the middle east (as seen in the United Emeriates), etc...

And at the same time declared war on the Saudi king because he allowed us bases in the holy kingdom to help us fight Gulf War 1 and for us to defend the kingdom.

I agree with it also; pro-Israel/Mideast presence.

Much like moonshine and the Judds)

Space in the New York Times is a premium.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0045.2
I don't know why they'd devote it to this drudge that insults people's intelligence.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0045.3
Well they devote space every week to David Brooks to write tripe like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/17/opinion/brooks-the-jeremy-lin-problem.html">this</a> .
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0045.4
Jeremy Lin is anomalous in all sorts of ways.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0045.5
Hes a Harvard grad in the N.B.A., an Asian-American man in professional sports.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0045.6
But we shouldnt neglect the biggest anomaly.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0045.7
Hes a religious person in professional sports.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0046.1
He posted an opinion about their opinion piece?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0046.2
My opinion: · It seems that the writer of the NYT op-ed would be OK with a fascist one-party state - just as long as they mostly did what he considered would make the nation great.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0046.3
His main point seems to be that you can justify restricting democracy as there are objective "right" courses of action, which the powerful can perceive but the hoi-polloi are too ignorant to appreciate.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0046.4
(Consider me underwhelmed)
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0046.5
He also appears not to value highly: · a) the right to disagree with him (aka what right would he have to force his policies on an unwilling majority) · b) Cut down corruption and keep politicians responsive by the threat of not re-electing them.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0046.6
Far from being dogma, point (b), when combined with transparency, is a very practical tool for encouraging good governance.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0046.7
Point (a) may somewhat be considered dogma...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0046.8
but to ignore it would be to throw away vast amount of equal rights/equal protection ethics and law.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0046.9
In my opinion, his opinion ain't worth the paper its written on.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0046.10
(And that's plenty bad as the NYT aint worth much at all).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0046.11
Are you reading his mind?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0047.1
You're trying to argue a strawman.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0047.2
Supporters of the US (such as myself) will say: supporting unsavory regimes may or may not be justifiable, i.e. aid given to Stalin in WW2 - despite him being 'orrible - was arguably the lesser evil.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0047.3
When we view Chinese oppression (i.e. at Tiananmen Square) there doesn't seem to be, what we would consider, a moral justification for it (unlike some US actions/aid given during WW2 and the Cold War).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0047.4
Note: that doesn't mean that the US always made the right decision, or that said support always turned out for the best, but it was intended to and often did.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0047.5
Unlike the Chinese regime - which appears to simply value the amoral pursuit and retention of power.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0047.6
You seem to be using the exact same argument you say is strawman!
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0047.7
The article itself does not say the Tiananmen Square atrocity was a good thing, what he argues is that it "was arguably the lesser evil", which is the exact same argument you use to say why you will support at times regimes that commit atrocities.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0047.8
As I said above it's an "the ends justify the means" argument.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0048.1
And America's Tiananmen?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0048.2
The Bonus Army attacks?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0048.3
Was that necessary too?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0048.4
None of which addresses the question, what exactly about the American form of government makes it proveably superior to what actually worked to get a billion people from the primitive conditions of the mid 20th century to China's status today?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0048.5
And for me being a pragmatist this is very important to understand.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0048.6
I feel that my democracy (warts and all) is "better" but lets say look at something that I consider very important in my society i.e. social mobility.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0048.7
It is hard to argue with the empirical fact that the government in China over the last two decades has done more to enable and promote social mobility than has been possible under my preferred system over the same period.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0048.8
It may well be that my preference is fundamentally no different to the fact most Christians are born into Christian families.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0049.1
The article is rather silly.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0049.2
It contends that democracy is young and that therefore history favors dictatorial systems of government.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0049.3
In doing so it ignores such facts as that the world changed in the past 100 years by more than it has changed in the previous 6000 - or indeed that the Chinese system it praises produced - just in the past 60 years - two major upheavals, one of which ended up as the greatest humanitarian disaster in history.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0049.4
It also ignores the fact that the rise of China coincides perfectly with their shift towards a more western model of economy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0049.5
It's patently ridiculous to claim their system is superior because it produced better economic results in the past three and a half years.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0049.6
Well, for one it did get approximately a billion people from the primitive conditions of the mid 18th century to Western status today.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0049.7
That counts?

McHrozni
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0049.9
On what planet did America have a billion citizens and progress 2 centuries in a little over 50 years?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.1
And right there is the whole problem I have with those who argue in favor of America's policies towards Saddam.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.2
The priority of his transgressions is determined not by net human suffering caused by him, but rather by whether supporting him benefits the U.S. or not.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.3
Personally, I'd argue that by far and away one of his "main transgressions" was the attempted genocide of Kurds, and the use of banned chemical weapons in doing so.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.4
But you see, those Kurds made the silly mistake of not being American citizens...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.5
so their attempted genocide is a "minor transgression" which can easily be swept aside.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.6
The issue is not one of priority but in the timeline of how events unfolded.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.7
Saddams' chemical attacks and genocide against the Kurds happened just before the end of the Iran-Iraq war.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.8
US support for Iraq quickly dried out afterwards, and left Iraq alienated from their key ally.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.9
You were told so before.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.10
Unless you'll claim that the US would have to foresee this years before the events took place you will need to address this issue.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.11
As to the relevance to this particular debate, it isn't the specific action, but rather the mentality behind it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.12
If one argues that "the end justifies the means", and that supporting Saddam was justifiable because of some distorted idea of a "greater good", then other governments have exactly the same prerogative to engage in abuses and atrocities, so long as they believe that it brings about some kind of "net benefit", otherwise known as the "It may be bad, but if we hadn't done it, it would have been worse" argument.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.13
How about this - the ends sometimes justify the means.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.14
In the case of Iran-Iraq war, supporting Saddam prevented a rise of a fanatical muslim power bent on domination in a critical region of the world.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.15
In the case of Tiannmen square, the massacre prevented...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.16
what exactly?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.17
Political reform that would end in somewhat lower economic growth for the next decade or two?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.18
The discrepancy is so huge I can easily say that the ends justify the means in one case and do not in the other without applying any double standards.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.19
Thus...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.20
if it is okay for the U.S. to support despotic regimes because it benefits American interests, then it is likewise okay for China to support despotic regimes because it benefits Chinese interests.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.21
And if it is wrong for China to do it, then it is wrong for America to do it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.22
Of course it is, but when viewed in the proper context, it is quickly evident that US support for Iraq is radically different from anything China is doing.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.23
Point out US support for Pinochet or Franco or South Vietnam if you will, those actually have significant resemblance to what China is doing.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.24
I'm not taking sides.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.25
I'm standing resolutely in the middle, saying that both sides are wrong -- and that confuses the hell out of those who see the world in black-and-white.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.26
I can sympathize with that, but you picked an entirely wrong example.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0071.27
McHrozni
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.1
So your argument is what...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.2
that Chinese censor their newspapers, so America should do the same?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.3
That it's wrong for a newspaper to have an opinion piece that expresses opinions contrary to your own?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.4
An idiotic argument on the face of it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.5
But I didn't make that argument!
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.6
So...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.7
you'll close your eyes, plug your ears, and go "nanananana...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.8
I'm not listening to you!"
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.9
Again, an idiotic argument.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.10
Strawmanning, are we?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.11
Regardless of your personal opinion of it, this is a perspective shared by a significant number of people in the world...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.12
and understanding it is far, far superior to saying, "I don't like it, so it is wrong to express it".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.13
Except that I didn't say so.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.14
Congrats...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.15
idiotic argument number three!
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.16
Since nowhere did I say that you are expected to agree with the article, or believe that the Chinese gov't is 'better'.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.17
The only issue here is that the New York Times, and any other newspaper, not only has a right to print such things (and not face the same kind of censorship that is practiced in China), but that printing such articles is good specifically because it expresses a view that while not mainstream in the U.S., is a dominant view in China.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.18
And understanding how other people think is the first step towards improving communication and relationships...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.19
as opposed to...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.20
oh...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.21
I don't know...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.22
simply declaring that anyone who says anything you disagree with should be silenced, or has no legitimate right to express their views.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.23
I had two major points with my post.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.24
One to cast light on that such articles are not permitted to be printed in China, but in the US, and perhaps some conclusions can be drawn from that.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.25
Second, to reject the notion that the options are either Chinese government or American government, and particularly the US is not the only democracy, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index">not even the most democratic country</a> .
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0072.26
Both of which you completely missed (or at least didn't bother to address).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.1
Enough of this.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.2

bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.3

I get a little tired of it, particularly since there's little reason for it.

bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.11
He doesn't need strawmen to make his point: The facts do it for him.

No, we don't have a political system like China's.

I'm grateful for that.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.14
But there are elements of tactics which the Chinese use which make me cringe, and some of these are utterly useless and barbaric.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.15
And ultimately, they drive away posters I want to hear from on issues where we might disagree and, (dare I say it), where I might be wrong.

The rest of us have had to make mistakes and learn from them.

It's how I learned to drive a truck, and it's still how I'm learning.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.21
Interestingly enough, I used to be ashamed of not having taken a driving course.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.22
On the other hand, in some ways, I'm a better driver than some for having had to learn it the hard way, and having had to take my knocks.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.23
It hasn't been easy, and some of the lessons have been expensive.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.24
None, however, have resulted in injury or death.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.25
It's a lot more than I can say for some of the jokers I've worked with who took extensive driving courses.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.26
(Including the guy who rear-ended a city bus, then blamed the passengers for taking too long to board.)

Just a reminder: I'm about to become a business owner.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.28
One way or another, it's going to happen.

I realize in the parlance of one board member, this will make me a "right-wing (capitalist) drongo," but it's also going to make me an employer.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.30
Perhaps not right away, but eventually.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.31
There's a lot to learn in this path, and I'm still trying to feel my way through.

Bound to be many.

I'm in a country which will allow me the option to make them.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.37
I'll take that.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.38
I don't expect anyone to agree with me.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.39
But at some point or another, I'd like the opportunity to be heard, without being belittled for it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.40
There are a lot of times when recognizing you're ignorant comes after you've put that ignorance on display.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.41
It's called "learning."

Here you go and make this great post, and it appears that everybody just ignored it and wen right back to bickering...

Well, I want you to know, i read it man.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0075.46
Well said.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0076.1
Perhaps you could try to fully explain your position properly next time instead of leaving it open to interpretation.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185521-440947_0076.2
I thought I did, but Wolfman left the thread apparently.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0243.1
It's been a long time since I saw the show, but from what I recall, I didn't take away that message from it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0243.2
I just remember it being about a father trying to find out what really happened to his daughter, and Joe Don Baker's radioactive act of revenge towards the end.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0243.3
I also recall it being a very well-made program.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0243.4
It is indeed great!
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0243.5
Especially Bob Peck's acting, as Ronald Craven, and the character Darius Jedburg (I am guessing this is Joe Don Baker).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0243.6
You're also right that it was about Bob Peck's uncovering of stranger and stranger circumstances behind his daughter's death but throughout the series he is "visited" by his daughter who was, in life, some kind of environmental activist for a group called "GAIA" who tells him some story about "black flowers" which somehow kill everyone off.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0243.7
I think at some point Jedburg says he saw the same flowers in Afghanistan and thinks there may be some truth to this.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0243.8
It is somewhat subtle and I probably wouldn't have noticed it had I not watched it recently but it is, I think, something of the moral message to the TV series.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0243.9
I agree though, that the series was really well-made.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0243.10
Looks like I'm not the only one who's been reminded of it either:

I'm sure this has come up already but could someone tell me, in a nutshell, what was so disastrous about Three Mile Island.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0245.2
I've known the name for a while as the name of an extraordinarily bad event but I haven't found any references to casualties in my (albeit) cursory search.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.1
§ The plant is safe now and will stay safe.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.2
§ Japan is looking at an INES Level 4 Accident: Nuclear accident with local consequences.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.3
That is bad for the company that owns the plant, but not for anyone else.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.4
§ Some radiation was released when the pressure vessel was vented.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.5
All radioactive isotopes from the activated steam have gone (decayed).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.6
A very small amount of Cesium was released, as well as Iodine.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.7
If you were sitting on top of the plants chimney when they were venting, you should probably give up smoking to return to your former life expectancy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.8
The Cesium and Iodine isotopes were carried out to the sea and will never be seen again.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.9
§ There was some limited damage to the first containment.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.10
That means that some amounts of radioactive Cesium and Iodine will also be released into the cooling water, but no Uranium or other nasty stuff (the Uranium oxide does not dissolve in the water).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.11
There are facilities for treating the cooling water inside the third containment.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.12
The radioactive Cesium and Iodine will be removed there and eventually stored as radioactive waste in terminal storage.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.13
§ The seawater used as cooling water will be activated to some degree.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.14
Because the control rods are fully inserted, the Uranium chain reaction is not happening.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.15
That means the main nuclear reaction is not happening, thus not contributing to the activation.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.16
The intermediate radioactive materials (Cesium and Iodine) are also almost gone at this stage, because the Uranium decay was stopped a long time ago.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.17
This further reduces the activation.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.18
The bottom line is that there will be some low level of activation of the seawater, which will also be removed by the treatment facilities.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.19
§ The seawater will then be replaced over time with the normal cooling water · § The reactor core will then be dismantled and transported to a processing facility, just like during a regular fuel change.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.20
§ Fuel rods and the entire plant will be checked for potential damage.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.21
This will take about 4-5 years.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.22
§ The safety systems on all Japanese plants will be upgraded to withstand a 9.0 earthquake and tsunami (or worse)
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.23

Skwinty...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.29
sounds as if the reactor cores are being directly flooded with seawater.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.30
Reactor cores are not generally flooded with coolant I assume.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.31
Is this seawater being circulated somehow do you know?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0246.32
Thanks.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0247.1
Only this afternoon there was an item about the fact that many (petro-chemical) pollutants were washed over crop fields because of the debris carried by the tsunami.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0247.2
Most forms of petro chemical polution of agricultural soils have a tendency to abate over time due to bio-degradation.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0247.3
It is even possible to remediate heavy metal polution through bio remidiation.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0247.4
Although, it is likely that most of these feilds will need to be taken out of production for a while.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0248.3
The power plant itself was the only real casualty.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0249.1
I was listening to a harrowing account of an elderly women looking through the wreckage of her home for her husband's medal (he had died 100 days before) and one of the journalist's descriptions turned to the globules of tarry petrochemicals dripping from everywhere.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0249.2
The local refinery had exploded before catching fire, how much damage is that type of pollution going to cause?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0249.3
Yes a nuclear reactor malfunctioning is very worrying - especially one so old - but I suspect that compared to the pollution caused by everything else as a result of the tsunami and earthquake it will be almost insignificant.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0249.4
Ah, but it has the word "nuclear" in it !!!

Well written.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.1
For the lurkers, since DC appears to be trollin' away to the hills now:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.2
The problem at Fukushima is a serious one.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.3
No one doubts that, and no one expects anyone to ignore it like it's a small car crash.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.4
Nuclear facilities going into meltdown is a big thing, and if the worst case scenario happens, will be a dangerous thing too.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.5
However, as has been pointed out time and time again, meltdown doesn't mean nuclear waste/fuel/radiation being pumped into the atmosphere.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.6
Nuclear meltdown doesn't mean the ground will be poisoned for decades.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.7
Nuclear meltdown with intact and fairly stable containment means a big mess and a lot of expensive cleaning up.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.8
If the containment was absent as it was in Chernobyl, yes, we would be seeing radiation entering the air at a fairly alarming rate, and if the containment is destroyed we might also see some smallscale but highly dangerous leakage.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.9
As it happens though, at worst one reactor containment area has been mildly damaged.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.10
This sounds alarming as hell, but all it means is a small amount of radiation is being leaked.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.11
So far this has peaked at a level that is not dangerous for small scale exposure, but prolonged and continuous exposure could well be harmful.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.12
However, it is notable that this peak was short lived, as far as I am aware, although if anyone wants to contradict me, show your sources.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.13
All this means is that in order to be in any danger whatsoever, you would have to stand in the affected area (between two reactors mark you, so not somewhere John Q Public is likely to be) for a prolonged time without a protective suit.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.14
Further to this, as it stands the radiation levels are dropping and plant cooling is occurring.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.15
A couple of the reactors have already gone into cold shut-down, meaning that they are now safe, and only one other reactor, Fukushima reactor 2, is still being cooled.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.16
This procedure seems to be going as smoothly as it can given the devastation wrought upon the area by the natural disasters that occurred.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.17
The same can not be said for the petrochemical plants in the area.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.18
That is not the way I udnerstand what is happening.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.19
The current issue now is not so much the reactors themselves, which are still at risk, but the spent fuel pools.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.20
The last explosion was caused by one of those pools in a reactor building where the reactor was not even in operation.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.21
They don't even know the status of the pools at reactor's 1 and 2.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0566.22
Those pools are NOT in containment like the reactors are.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0567.1
I think they're talking about Fukushima Daini, not Fukushima Daiichi.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0567.3

It's both due to half-life being so short.

About the 400 mSv/hr figure:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0570.2
The JAIF reports 400 mSv "beside Unit 3" and about 500 μSv/hr at the NPS (I assume nuclear power station) border.

bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0570.6
I'm not sure, but my guess is that the cabinet secretary misquoted the numbers.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0570.7

An in-depth IAEA study, described as a "three-volume, 600-page report and incorporating the work of hundreds of scientists, economists and health experts, assesses the 20-year impact of the largest nuclear accident in history" had this to say about the health effects on humans:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0571.3
Approximately 1 000 on-site reactor staff and emergency workers were heavily exposed to high-level radiation on the first day of the accident; among the more than 200,000 emergency and recovery operation workers exposed during the period from 1986-1987, an estimated 2,200 radiation-caused deaths can be expected during their lifetime.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0571.4
An estimated five million people currently live in areas of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine that are contaminated with radionuclides due to the accident; about 100,000 of them live in areas classified in the past by government authorities as areas of "strict control".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0571.5
The existing "zoning" definitions need to be revisited and relaxed in light of the new findings.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0571.6
About 4,000 cases of thyroid cancer, mainly in children and adolescents at the time of the accident, have resulted from the accident's contamination and at least nine children died of thyroid cancer; however the survival rate among such cancer victims, judging from experience in Belarus, has been almost 99%.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0571.7
Most emergency workers and people living in contaminated areas received relatively low whole body radiation doses, comparable to natural background levels.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0571.8
As a consequence, no evidence or likelihood of decreased fertility among the affected population has been found, nor has there been any evidence of increases in congenital malformations that can be attributed to radiation exposure.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0571.9
Poverty, "lifestyle" diseases now rampant in the former Soviet Union and mental health problems pose a far greater threat to local communities than does radiation exposure.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0571.10
Not quite the radiological disaster on human health as one might have thought given the seriousness of the accident.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0654.1

Those hydrogen explosions that have been on the news and TEPCO admitting that the core water level in the three reactors are half full, recovering from dried and half full, indicate to me that this is a full on complete meltdown in all three reactors.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0655.2
In two of those they are admitting that there is fuel damage and they are venting the containment, which means that we have a continuing uncontrolled release of fission products to the atmosphere.

I'm usually a champion of NPR as a news source but their reporting on this story (at least on Morning Edition and All Things Considered) has been appallingly bad, spreading all kinds of misinformation, though I don't necessarily think its deliberate.

bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.3
2) Complain that the operation of nukes costs so much money, but then go ahead making massive protests & demonstrations at, and tie themselves to, the train tracks of the Castor transports.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.4
This causes extreme delays in the transport, requires way more police personnel then normally required for that longer time.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.5
And last time, the managed to tie them to the tracks in such a way that workers had to actually cut these tracks apart and repair them afterwards.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.6
3) Complain about the fact that there is no suitable terminal storage facility, but actively work against getting one built.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.7
4) Complain about old, unsafe reactors, but force the government to ban companies from building new and safer ones.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.8
At the same time this also causes the companies to keep the old ones running even longer, prolonging the risk.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.9
For example,here in Germany, if you have a photo-voltaic system running (solar cells), the energy companies are forced to buy that electricity, and the PV owner gets about 43 Euro-Cent per kilowatt-hour.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.10
Regular electricity costs "only" about 13 or 14 Euro-Cent per kW/h. And in that price there is the added premium of 3 or 4 Cents per kW/h included that results from the "Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz (EEG)", which means "renewable energies law".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.11
This means that _everyone_ has to pay a premium to keep that system alive.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.12
I'm absolutely sure that if those people who have contracts for getting only renewable energy instead of the regular energy mix, would have to pay the _full_ price, they surely would be the first ones to scream "we want nukes!"
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.14
After all, that price would be at least 50 to 60 Cent per kW/h, if the PV owners already get 43 Cent....
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.15
And they have the balls to complain that nuclear energy is partially subsidized.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.16
Hypocrisy at it's finest, i tell you.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.17
Let's not forget that they also want to have electric cars everywhere instead of combustion engines.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.18
But somehow they don't spend a minute thinking about where that amount of electricity should come from.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.19
Let alone the problems of manufacturing and disposing suitable batteries.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.20
I simply fail to see how all that is supposed to work, and to be achieved, in the long run.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.21
Without exception they all completely ignore the energy, material, production, build and space needed to switch to renewable energy completely.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.22
For them, wind-parks and solar-panels seem to grow on trees, install themselves, hook themselves up to the grid, and need no space at all.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.23
And of course these technologies are obviously able to produce electricity 24/7, regardless of the fact that most of the day there isn't enough sun or wind.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.24
But hey, i'm happy to switch to renewable energy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.25
Bring me a bunch of anti-nuke people and a bunch of stationary bicycles with fat dynamos, and i'm sure i can manage to hook them to my distribution box.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.26
Presto, renewable energy!

Why is the Anti Nuke movement so much more powerful in Germany then it is in other European countries?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0660.30
Just curious.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0997.1
The evacuation zone was precautionary.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0997.2
So far, nothing has happened to require a complete survey before letting people return to their homes after the crisis is over.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0997.3
Case in point if it is 300 micro Sv per hour at the plant outside perimeter, it can't be that high 1km, 5km, or even 30 km away.

The explosions were from hydrogen gas generated when the reactor cores, and apparently in at least one case, a spent fuel rod pool, were partially uncovered by falling (evaporating, maybe leaking) water levels.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0998.2
The steam was dissociated into its components hydrogen and oxygen.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0998.3
This is not true.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0998.4
The hydrogen comes from the zirc-water reaction.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0998.5
Zr + 2H2O -> ZrO2 + 2H2
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0999.1
If they kept the pumps running, then why did three reactor buildings blow up?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0999.2
Building that had fuel rods on top of the buildings?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0999.3
Why did they run out of power after 8 hours?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0999.4
That doesn't make any sense at all.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0999.5
And if something doesn't make sense, it probably isn't true.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0999.6
If you lost your power supply, and you know that if the pumps stop it is disaster, why would they not fly in power for pumps?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0999.7
Before they fail?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0999.8
This is wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-351953_0999.9
There is something wrong here.

If that is true, then the design of the back up system is terrible.

Jerry Sandusky, former defensive coordinator of Penn State's football team, has been indicted on multiple charges involving sexual contact with a minor (you can find the indictment <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/uploadedFiles/Press/Sandusky-Grand-Jury-Presentment.pdf">here</a> , but be warned it is a VERY difficult read).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0001.2
Over the course of over ten years, he used his charity for underprivileged children to meet potential new victims and established a pattern of abuse which has now been brought to light.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0001.3
There is much to be discussed here, especially regarding the responsibilities of witnessing parties/athletic administration and the way the public will view the tragedy in the scope of "well, it's awful, but how will it affect FOOTBALL?"
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0002.1
This is beyond disgusting, many people should be in prison over this.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0002.2
Matt Millen broke down talking about it on ESPN.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0003.3
I'm not a legal expert, but I think failure to report is something that you can only get fined for, kind of a public shaming.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0003.4
But I agree, there should at least be a house-cleaning in the athletic department.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0003.5
One thing that is interesting is the contradiction between what Joe Paterno has said in his public statements recently (namely, that the GA gave him explicit details matching the testimony of what he witnessed) and in his own testimony (namely, that the GA had told him "something of a sexual nature" had been witnessed).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0003.6
Either he was really being vague on purpose in his testimony, he's lying now, or he was lying on the stand.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0003.7
All of this is just awful.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0072.1
First of all, I'm stealing that line.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0072.2
Second, I was just taking a look at this animal's wikipedia entry and found this:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0072.3
Should I be as disturbed by this as I am?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0072.4
This whole thing is disgusting.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0072.5
It really makes you wonder not only how widespread it is, but also how widespread it could become.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0072.6
I recently read about the custom of men in the Middle East keeping harems of boys, and how some of the boys interviewed said they couldn't wait to become men so they could get their own harems of boys.

I had a job that required me to visit some charter schools in Oregon, out in the rural areas.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0072.8
Something stood out to me -- all the teachers at the three schools I visited were men.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0072.9
It struck me as odd, so I did an online search of teacher statistics and found that Oregon has a higher number of male teachers than the national average, by a significant amount (this was a few years ago, so I can't remember the exact statistic).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0072.10
I know there is a well organized international network of pedophiles, with their own websites, etc. I started thinking, what if word got around about places (like Thailand, for example) where child sex was easy to get, or where so many members of the population were pedophile-friendly, that no matter how high you went, you could not get anybody to take any action against them?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0072.11
Now comes Penn State with a pretty good example of how that can work.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0072.12
I don't know who blew the whistle on this one, but if Sandusky were a close friend of the governor or the president, we might never have found out.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.1
If I were to witness a man anally raping a 10-year-old, I'm not walking away from that.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.2
I'm not leaving that child there.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.3
And if--IF--it came down to violence to stop him, then that's what it comes down to.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.4
Make of it what you will, won't hurt me none.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.5
I'm not trying to hurt anyone, but most would claim the same about joining the Nazis and persecuting Jews in WWII Germany.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.6
electrocuting people as part of an experiment, etc. Meanwhile we know demonstrably that most of the time this is not the case.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.7
Fine; a whole bunch of apathetic individuals came across this.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.8
Highly doubtful, and not in relation to any of the psychology topics I mentioned.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.10
nothing seems to have changed.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.11
Whether the inaction was the result of people just not particularly caring, or choosing their friend's safety over the rape victims', or being absolutely evil...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.12
it makes no difference to the outcome, any more than does the fact that, after all, Sandusky did run a charity for children.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.13
They chose to do nothing, and because of that more abuse took place - both directly (in the case of the little boy Sandusky was allowed to finish raping after being walked in on) and indirectly (in the case of other children Sandusky had access to who were abused because nobody reported Sandusky).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.14
All their current finger-pointing and buck-passing and shouts of "it wasn't my responsibility" that we're currently witnessing is nothing but a QED of exactly the attitude that facilitated Sandusky's abuses.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.15
Obviously it won't change anything in this case, but understanding why this happened again and again could help lead to policies preventing such lapses.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.16
Or it could help us better correct for such perverse influences our own moral thinking.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.17
And in the case of blame I think proclaiming guilt on a person affects both individuals, so it is best to be most accurate.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.18
The discussion hasn't been about the issue; it's been about what a bad guy the graduate assistant was.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.19
According to the indictment, the graduate assistant was "distraught" and "upset" by what he saw.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.20
Basically he was a victim of Sandusky, too.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.21
The transgressions listed in the indictment began in 1994, and there were many opportunities along the way for other people to stop Sandusky before he raped the boy in the locker room 2002, including an actual police report in 1998.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.22
If responsible people had done their jobs, the GA would not have been put in a position he had no training for.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.23
It's definitely a fascinating phenomenon.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.24
The GA, as an employee of the school and part of its culture, somehow "got" that going directly to the police might not work out for the best.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.25
Could he believe his eyes?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.26
Would he embarrass the boy?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.27
Would the police believe him over a professor emeritus (which Sandusky is)?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.28
I am sure many questions ran through his head while he was trying to deal with what he had seen, or thought he had seen.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.29
And what about all the other people who "knew," but didn't want to know?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.30
Sandusky's wife, the boys' parents, Schultz, Curley, Paterno, the police detectives who interviewed Sandusky in 1998 and got him to promise never to do it again?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.31
So much goes into enabling pedophiles, especially when they are respected members of the communities.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.32
The victims themselves don't even know what's going on when it is happening to them; they don't even know they have rights.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.33
Until recent times, pedophilia has not been, in our culture, a simple question of right vs. wrong or black vs. white.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.34
A lot of it has been about protecting the "dignity" of the predator.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.35
I agree, except for the beginning bit as being stated too strongly.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0073.36
While many seem content with the "kick the pedo's ***" motto and no one has said they would do the same as these individuals, it is remarkable how many individuals independently "knew".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.1
Thanks for picking me, ALB.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.2
I'll try not to let down the side.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.3
What I actually said, both times, was that I would get that child out of that place.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.4
The order of events and their priority are really important, you see.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.5
The child's safety is my prime objective.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.6
I mention violence to the perpetrator as a secondary possibility that I'd take on only if necessary to secure my primary objective.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.7
If I could get the child out of there without touching the perp in any way, I'd certainly rather do that.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.8
I didn't mean to misquote you, I apologize.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.9
How do I know I'd react this way?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.10
I've two reasons:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.11
1. Having survived serial sexual abuse, I know first-hand what that child's experiencing (as I rather expect a certain number of the rest of us might be able to say, true?)
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.12
And my first instinct today would be to immediately secure that child's safety.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.13
From a purely personal point of view that not everyone can share with me, I do know my instincts.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.14
2. I know I'd do it, because I've done it before.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.15
What other people's reasons are for saying the same thing I've said, I couldn't tell you.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.16
I know only what I would do, I know exactly why I'd do it, and I know I'm certain of it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.17
In that case, you most certainly do know what you would do, and I'm deeply and truly sorry you experienced such an awful thing firsthand.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.18
So what's the argument here?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.19
That I'm wrong to state absolutely that I know I would have reacted differently?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.20
Because I've re-read my two initial posts on the subject, and nowhere in there did I talk about anyone's reactions but my own.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.21
Now I realizes this means I'm also criticizing McQueary's actions by implication.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.22
So are you.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.23
So is everyone else.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.24
No one here is excusing him.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.25
The problem seems to be only that a few of us are claiming to know what we'd do in the same circumstances.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.26
Why this is a problem for anyone, I cannot fathom, any more than I can fathom simply walking away and leaving that child to be raped.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.27
I won't be discussing it any further.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.28
I see no point to it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.29
My own point was simply to express my utter incredulity that anyone, ANYONE, could simply walk away from a child being anally raped, right before his eyes.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.30
I've expressed that.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.31
If anyone else has anything to say about it, fap away.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.32
I don't have a problem with you saying that, and I don't think you're wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.33
I am sorry it seemed that way.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.34
I think that since this is such an emotionally-charged topic, in particular for someone who went through sexual abuse, that it is easy for things to be misconstrued.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.35
I find it difficult to imagine anyone, in particular myself, responding the way MacQueary did.

I don't feel a need to continue that particular line of discussion, myself, as I don't really see it going anywhere productive and I don't want to drive away intelligent participants from the conversation.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0117.37
I sincerely apologize if it seemed as if I were criticizing you or saying you were wrong, as nothing could be farther from the truth.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0118.2
It's fine, really.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0118.3
I'm not angry, especially not with you, and I would really hate it if you came away from this thinking I were angry.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0118.4
I assure you sincerely, that isn't the case at all.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0118.5
Your points are well-taken.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0118.6
But I could counter them, and did, and that's all.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0118.7
No harm, buddy, and surely no foul, to use a likely inappropriate sport metaphor.

I think if there's one thing we can learn from this whole thing, it's that absolutes are never correct
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0120.1
Right - a false dichotomy I was responding to in posts in this thread.

In essence, McQueary goes all Braveheart on Sandusky or he's a complicit monster.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0120.3
It seems to me that a 3rd option of "he should have at least called the police" is also being advocated here.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0120.4
Thus, how's about we put off the "string him up" talk until we know what the heck we're dealing with?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0120.5
Some of us don't want to wait years or decades to have a discussion on "current" events.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0120.6
Waiting until we know what really happened usually requires, at a minimum, that the investigations, trials, and appeals be concluded.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0120.7
And usually, even then, we won't know the full story.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0120.8
It's OK to form opinions and discuss them in the meantime.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0120.9
I trust most of this people on this site to modify their opinions accordingly as new information comes in.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0121.3
Oh, yeah, absolutely!

Anal assault?

Depends on your definition of assault.

In need of immediate intervention?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0187.9
That is not so black and white.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0187.10
Were this a boy and an adult woman with her hands on the wall, would everyone be as visceral in their reactions?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0187.11
Would everyone feel it needed to be stopped immediately?

An adult having sex with a minor is legally rape.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0187.14
A man having sex with a minor is taking.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0187.15
A woman having sex with a minor boy is taking by giving, providing satisfaction.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0187.16
I think this is a good point.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0187.17
Children are devalued in most western cultures.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0187.18
We all learn at home and in school that adults are to be given the benefit of the doubt, while children are not.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0187.19
Most of us are prepared to discipline children at the drop of a hat, but there are a lot more cultural rules to be followed when confronting other adults.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0187.20
You seem to have missed his point.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.1
You know, not that I'm excusing it in any way, but I can understand the Catholic apologetics like Donahue in the wake of the RCC scandal, because the RCC is founded on religious beliefs.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.2
People are afraid of the word of the Church Jesus or God being undermined, so they rush in with the support of people who failed to act as an attempt to preserve their faith.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.3
I may think it's terrible, but at least I can wrap my brain around their mentality.

But football?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.5
People let this continue for years, and now fans are showing outpourings of support towards Paterno, because of football?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.6
I really agree with this.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.7
Here is an article that expands:

Its connected to the Bowl Championship Series, conference realignment and all the ways in which college football has morphed over the last generation into a multibillion-dollar big business.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.9
This isnt about Sandusky.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.10
This is about about a culture that says the football team must be defended at all costs: a culture where the sexual assault of a 10-year-old is reported to Paterno before the police.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.11
This is what happens when a football program becomes the economic and spiritual heartbeat of an entire section of a state.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.12
The Nittany Lions football regularly draws 100,000 fans to Happy Valley.

They also produce $50 million in pure profit for the University every year and has been listed as the most valuable team in the Big 10 conference.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.14
Another economic report held that every Penn State game pumps $59 million into the local economy: from hotels to kids selling homemade cookies by the side of the road.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.15
Its no wonder that Paterno is revered.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.16
He took a football team and turned it into an economic life raft for a university and a region.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.17
When something becomes that valuable, a certain mindset kicks in. Protect the team above all over concerns.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.18
Protect Joe Pa.

Protect Nittany Lions football.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0188.20
Protect the brand.

The love was evident as several hundred students crowded around Paterno's house, located just a couple of blocks from campus.

Chants of "We are Penn State!"

And note that Sandusky "retired" right after that incident, in the prime of his career when he was a shoo-in to get a head coaching job.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0189.2
Speculation today is the retirement was forced because PSU knew he was a child molester, yet they allowed him to use their facilities for his football camp for troubled children.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0189.4
There was a scandal at Notre Dame last year that created a lot of furor locally (I don't think it got much national news attention) where an unidentified athlete was accused of sexually assaulting a freshman girl.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0189.5
The university waited 2 weeks before contacting the South Bend police, by which time the alleged victim had committed suicide.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0189.6
That actually looks well-handled in comparison to the PSU scandal.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0189.7
Well-handled?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0190.9
To revisit this: I think you're off your rocker.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0190.10
I can't conceive of a single instance of an adult "having anal sex with" a ten-year-old that would not qualify as an assault, nor can I imagine what makes you think that there's any kind of circumstance which would render such a rape not in need of immediate intervention if such is possible.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0190.11
In retrospect, this is one of the most abhorrent posts I've ever had the pleasure of reading on this forum.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0191.1
It seems to me that people up and down the chain of command have violated the Cleary Act.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0191.2
Every time someone on my campus is mugged, rather a lot, now I that I think about it, the campus police release a report of the incident and highlight the cleary act in the subject line.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0191.3
This full disclosure is federal law, and if it was not acted on at Penn State, well, yikes.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0191.4
The Chronicle of Higher Ed reports that the Education Dept. is now investigating.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0192.1
Well-handled?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0192.2
By comparison.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0192.3
The furor over ND was that they waited 2 weeks to notify the police (or properly counsel the victim), while PSU never did.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0192.4
Were it not for the 2009 complaint that brought on the Grand Jury investigation I doubt they'd ever have said anything.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.1
this is a ridiculous comparison, and I have to wonder why you would go to such lengths to make excuses for the guy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.2
I would not.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.3
I find it interesting that people keep assuming this because I point, as others have, to the social sciences for understanding these actions.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.4
It is disappointing because I really wanted people to focus on the facts and not my personal opinion on it all (more on that later).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.5
First off, the people in Nazi Germany had been brainwashed for decades, with Nazi propaganda promoted to kids from the cradel.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.6
Kids were even told to inform on their parents if they started telling them anti-Nazi ideology, so you had a situation where parents saw their own children being bred into Nazis by the state but felt powerless to try and stop it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.7
Second of all, not collaberating with the Nazis had enormous repreccusions.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.8
You or your sons could be sent to the Russian front.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.9
You could end up in a concentration camp, or prison, or summarily executed.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.10
You could lose your job at a time and place where starvation was rampant, and your family could die if you lost your job.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.11
That was absolutely nothing like what this guy faced.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.12
He was not brought up in a culture where child rape is acceptable.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.13
He was not risking his life to help the child.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.14
the very worst thing that could have happened to him is that he would not be believed and he could loose a job.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.15
And this isn't winter in Nazi Germany in 1941.

I was trying to argue against a famed moral dilemma that has people in their armchairs pontificating that they would never turn in Jews, etc. You are exactly right about the influences at play that lead to normal people behaving in such an abnormal manner.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.19
And the reason people are focussing so much on the GA is with the actual perpetrator, well he's clearly just an evil person.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.20
Evil people do evil things and what else can you say about it?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.21
But by his own admission, the GA was very distraught over what he saw.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.22
He knew he saw something horrible.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.23
He wasn't some low life sociopath or masochist.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.24
That makes him failing to act much, much worse.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.25
He was exactly the kind of person who could and should have interceeded.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.26
Agreed.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.27
This idea about "not comprehending what he was seeing" or "thinking he was hallucinating" really is a ridiculous stretch, and I don't see how someone could go to such lengths to excuse him.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.28
To that extent, yes.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.29
And the fact that his father is saying that "he did exactly what he was supposed to" and making it seem like the GA is himself a victim in all of this - Mary stating that he is a victim in all this, is simply disgusting.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.30
This guy was not a victim.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.31
Seeing something difficult does not make you a victim.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.32
This guy was not some 12 year old kid, he was a grown man who could have intervened, and did not.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.33
He was a coward, and there is no excuse for him.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.34
Calling him a victim, Mary, is simply beyond terrible.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.35
That child was a victim of both his rapist, and the man who saw him and did nothing.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.36
The child was his victim, this guy was a victim of nothing but his own cowardice and moral failings.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.37
I agree.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.38
My problem hasn't been with any of this, but the way people have been acting like his failing was some unthinkably extreme character deficiency.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.39
My real position is that human nature is horrible, from our rational moral principle perspective.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.40
This man's character is no more scummy than one's neighbour, who honestly is probably sitting on a similar story about Uncle Joe.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.41
And by "no more" I mean just as scummy, just under the right bizarre influences.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.42
When I was having sex at eight, people "knew".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.43
It is an age old story because human nature doesn't change.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0317.44
So people can leap onto their high horses and espouse moral dictums, but I will be skeptical.

I believe it's our tendency to make excuses, to forgive those not upholding our morals, avoiding accountability, and lauding the protectionism of authority that create this tendency towards inaction.

The whole "We are Penn State" thing came from an incident in which the team was set to play in the segregated South and one or more of their African American players were taking heat.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0335.10
The team's response was that all of them, black and white, were integral to that team identity.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0335.11
It was a gutsy show of solidarity against institutionalized racism.

Through the years, Joe could've made tons more money.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0335.13
He could've recruited better athletes and won more championships.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0335.14
But he had a love of that community - to which he's donated millions - and a dedication to honor first, and winning second.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0335.15
That's why it's so painful now to learn that in this critical instance Joe's moral compass sent him to the Bermuda Triangle.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0335.16
He really is a superb human being, but in this case he flat out failed to live up to anything near his own code of honor.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0335.17
That's the tragic irony and the cognitive dissonance here.

Well said, thanks.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0335.19
He is certainly not faultless here and he knows and has said as much; his punishment is far more than a sad ending to an unmatched and otherwise extremely honorable career.

bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0336.2
If I thought a member of my family or circle of friends had responded as was described in the Grand Jury paper I would be more angry than I would on learning of a similar set of circumstances involving a work colleague.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0336.3
Good idea, although I'm betting initially you would assume innocence and need one heckuva a case and a LOT of evidence to be swayed otherwise.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0336.4
And there is little evidence in this right now.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0336.5
There are accusations and testimonials only.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0336.6
Strong stuff but IMO not nearly enough to *BANG* stop or I'll shoot.

I just think it would have been nice/advisable to have this go to court and KNOW what's what before people started throwing molotov cocktails every which way.

He has been in a position of knowing he could have done more for the last (around) 10 years so I don't see why it should now start being a punishment?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0338.1
I'm not sure, but to me a superb human being might be moved to get off his ass and go investigate when it's reported that one of his staff
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0338.2
Sandusky was not one of this staff.

oops, sorry, I threw another fact in there.

That's the point I was making earlier when I said I could understand why he did not take immediate action when he saw the child being raped and I accept that is how humans can react in such stressful circumstances.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0340.11
But that only covers the immediate reaction, from what others have posted it seems that for years after witnessing the child being raped he would have seen the rapist with young children.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0340.12
Given that I do think it is right to conclude that to not have taken further action over that timespan is a character flaw.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0341.1
Wow.

But when something this shocking blindsides you in an instant, FYI it might not be so easy/simple and being human you might not take the best path.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0341.7
I do not excuse anyone in this situation who didn't, btw. Just something to think about.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.1
This reminds me of a situation that happened to me a while ago that shows the apathy of even the police.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.2
( warning, read completely, for my sake, lol.)
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.3
It was new years and me and some friends were at the bar, a female made her way over and started to hit on the lot of us ( 3 gents in total.)
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.4
, one friend was not into anything of that nature, but me and the other were good to go.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.5
Now she was drunk, but no more than us, ( or so we thought) and she was rather up front about what she was looking for.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.6
It was snowy, terrible, and none of us had coats ( and i found my cab money has disapeared.)
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.8
So we started a rather long walk across town.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.9
Now half way there she starts acting very erratic, getting intensely angry, not being able to stand, then getting really happy ( also unable to stand.)
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.10
, keep in mind it was around 2 am, so frequently we were telling her to not yell so loud, etc.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.11
Now, i inquired and found out that she did large doeses of prescription drugs, and they had just started to kick in. So the plan changed from what it was, to getting her somewhere so she didn't wander off in the snow and die.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.12
Now, while i know we were doing good, think of what this would look like to onlookers.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.13
3 gents, seemingly dragging a very inebriated girl around saying things to the nature of " Just shut up" ( in relation to her loud screaming of odd, or vulgar things.)
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.15
I personally thought we would get stopped at some point and have a long awkward explination.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.16
But not so much, people looked, some people almost came over, but no one did anything.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.17
Even when we walked by a female cop, and she jokingly said, loudly something about being kidnapped.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.18
The cop was about to come over, but decided against it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.19
I just don't get it, if the people were wrong, it would just have been a laugh, nothing big except for some wasted time, and awkwardness.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.20
But what if we were planning something bad and taking her against her will?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.21
( which, it really would have seemed.)
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.22
Sometimes i just don't get people.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.23
( as a post script, upon getting back to my friends place, she proceeded to puke violently, and then, of all things, still try and push for the threeway.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.24
Seeing as she was completely out of her mind, though very energetic, i spent a couple of hours convincing her it was a bad idea, and that, at least, she should wait to sober up a bit to make that decision.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.25
Thankfully that pissed her, off and she ended up getting a safe way home with our third buddy. )
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0342.26

You don't seem to have read the grand jury paper - in that he stated that he was informed of (at least) a matter of inappropriate sexual activity.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0343.7
I condemn him based on his own testimony.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0344.6
He has had years in which to take action - he choose not to.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0345.4
As I understand, he was on the staff when the first incident happened.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0345.5
BTW I'm amused by this part, because I don't have the impression that you're fact-oriented.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0345.6
Just the opposite actually.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0346.1

So shocked and disoriented by what was seen and reported that they could hardly get it together to plan their 81 football games between the incident and last weekend.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0346.3
I just feel horrible for them.

Couldn't have possibly put it better than this.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.1
This actually seems to be the prevailing attitude at a few Penn State message boards I've lurked at.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.2
That not one person who approves of Joe's firing is anything more than jealous of his success or is just reveling at seeing an icon fall.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.3
In fact, I've seen multiple cases of people saying things like "We will rise above this" and genuinely portraying this entire scandal as a concentrated attack against for Penn State.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.4
Everyone's just jealous of how awesome they are, and will stop at nothing!
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.5
There are a fair amount of people arguing - seriously - that most of the anger about the case is about people not being Penn State fans.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.6
There is a lot of claims that this is nothing more but some giant conspiracy between the media and anti Penn Staters to bring them down.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.7
There are many people acting like this entire scandal is about nothing more than malicious efforts to bring down Penn State because of how awesome they are.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.8
They are painting themselves (school, faculty, and fans) as the real victims in all this.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.9
The big argument they are using is that Joe and McQueary both reported the incident to their superiors, and that going to the police would have been wrong because they would be undermining their superiors.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.10
They are literally saying that going above one's superiors is worse than going to the police once one's superiors take action.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.11
What gets me is that there are people not just excusing Paterno and McQueary's actions as understandable human foibles, but are actually praising them.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.12
I have seen large numbers of Penn State cheerleaders saying that it is wisdom and maturity to not go to the police but instead count on one's superiors to handle things directly and defer to their determinations (such as not pressing charges or going to the police).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.13
While they all seem to agree that the superiors are at fault for not reporting it, Paterno and McQueary are to be commended simply for reporting it and then doing the "appropriate" thing by not undermining their superior's decision.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.14
And I've seen variants of this line about a million times by now:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.15
"I really feel sorry for people with such hate in their hearts that they feel the need to go after Papa Joe after (list professional accomplishments of Paterno).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.16
Paterno did what he was supposed to, and still has said that he is sorry he didn't do more.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.17
As a Christian, I pity all these hateful critics and I will pray for them."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.18
Also, Penn State fans are being encouraged to wear white to the next game in order to protest the persecution of Paterno and express their support.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.19
Wow, this is pretty appalling.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.20

I just don't get this.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.30
McQueary tells JoePa that he saw "something inappropriate of sexual nature" between Sandusky and a 10 year old kid.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.31
And Paterno says, "Ok, thank you for that, have a nice day" and tells the AD?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.32
That doesn't make any sense.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.33
He doesn't say, "What do you mean, "inappropriate"?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.34
What exactly did you see?"
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.35
This was an act supposedly by his best buddy, happening right in his lockerrooms, and he doesn't ask for ANY details to find out precisely what the guy was talking about?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.36
I said it before, this was Paterno's football program, and he is responsible for stuff going on within it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.37
He can't pass the buck and say, "Don't look at me, I told my boss."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.39
But no, he acts as if he got a memo from the McQueary and forwarded it on to his superiors like he was supposed to.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.40
It just doesn't make sense.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.41
If that is what he did, he totally ignored the severity of the accusation, if not legally, but absolutely in terms of the impact it could have on his football program.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.42
Yeah, the more I think about it, the more I believe that not only did Paterno fail miserably at handling the case, but he was possibly completely aware of what was going but was just protecting his buddy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.43
I can't prove this, obviously, but when you gather all the facts, it paints a likelier story, IMO.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0439.44
Anyway, he's either a completely incompetent coward, or a lowlife scumbag protecting his child-raping friend.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0440.1
You are probably not told even once what to do if you see a man raping a child in the shower.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0440.3
Because there are some things you don't need to be told since they are so bleeding obvious?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0441.1
He didn't look away and he did have empathy for the victim.

Mike McQueary is an interesting case in that he was practically raised to be a part of the Penn State family.

bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0441.7
If there was ever someone destined to spend their life on the sidelines with Paterno, it was him.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0546.1
Actually, he told his father, who told him to tell Paterno, THEN he told Paterno the next day.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0546.2
Who waited a day before telling his boss, who waited a week before telling his boss, who didn't do anything of merit apart from taking the keys to the locker room away from Sandusky.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0546.3
edit: Also, the GA didn't just witness a child being molested.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0546.4
It really needs to be stated that what the GA saw happening was full anal intercourse with a ten-year-old boy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0546.5
The fact that it was then euphemized as "some horseplay in the showers" by administration officials is something that really outrages me.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0546.6
I didn't know it was that bad.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0547.1
According to McQueary that is exactly what did happen - have you not read the indictment?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0547.2
I didn't read it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0547.3
Did the kid say anything?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0547.4
Did McQueary have eye contact?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0547.5
If so and McQueary walked out, he should be fired as well.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0548.1
I think you mean "Paterno".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0548.2
At any rate, according to the GJ report the boy and McQueary did make eye contact when he saw the boy being raped.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0548.3
Yes, my bad.

The kid has never been identified, so we only have McQueary's word for it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0549.6
And McQueary says that both the child and Sandusky made eye contact, and saw he was there.

and there is precious little room for interpretation.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0552.1
McQueary said Sandusky and the kid saw him but he didn't say there was eye contact.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0552.2
I mean, saying they saw him could mean eye contact or it could mean no eye contact.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0552.3

Most research so far has refereed pedophilia as a 'paraphilia', which essentially means getting off on sick and abnormal things and situations.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0554.2
I've read that some professionals have called pedophilia a sexual orientation because, just like 'homosexuality' and 'heterosexuality', it is usually stable and is formed early in the sexual development.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0554.3
Notwithstanding whether calling pedophilia a sexual orientation is in anyway good and informative, this naturally causes all kinds of controversy because it includes such freakish monsters with "normal people" and how it supposedly 'normalizes' pedophilia and child-molesters.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0554.4
A common theme is that people started to make homosexuality acceptable then later it will be pedophilia and then it will be...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0554.5
the end of society?

<snip>
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0554.7
So pedophilia is not considered a result of a developmental disruption (like rape or molestation as a child) and therefore preventable?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0554.8
I was so hoping...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0554.9
I assumed that was what happened to Michael Jackson.

I haven't read every post, but I haven't heard about any of his victims actually coming forward..
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0555.2

bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0555.3
One article I read said the average pedophile has over 200 victims in a lifetime.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0556.4
I don't know about paedophilia generally, but wrt pederasty in particular I read one article somewhere that said it was caused by an extreme form of sexual narcissism.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0556.5
Its basically love of an idealised, younger version of the molester's self.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0556.6
So I suppose it would be caused by similar things to those which cause Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0556.7
I'm not sure though, I'd have to look the article up.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0557.2
They must be considering children in images and videos the pedophile looked at in order to arrive at 200.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0557.3
That can't be the number they physically touched....
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0557.4
if that's what you read there is no way that is true.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0558.4
You know how you read something, and a half-formed thought comes immediately to mind?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0558.5
My half-formed thought was...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0558.6
has it then been incorrect all this time that some victims become abusers?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0558.7
Does that then never happen?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0558.8
I've heard that it does, all my life it seems.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0558.9
But if pedophilia is an orientation, like homosexual or heterosexual or bisexual...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0558.10
then victims don't "become," do they?...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0558.11
or do they?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0558.12
Or what?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0698.1
Repeating a question before answering it is thought to be an indicator of deception, according to this:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0698.2
<a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/neuronarrative/201106/how-we-know-youre-lying">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/...ow-youre-lying</a>
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0698.3
I have encountered this notion before.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0698.4
I know it's a delaying tactic, but I would think even an honest person might use it, if they know the answer isn't exactly going to make them or the situation look good.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0698.5
If they need time to make sure they answer with the truth, but in a way that won't be misperceived.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0698.6
It could go either way, I suppose, and it's probably more important to also be looking for the other indicators in that list, as well.

Skeptical Greg,
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0699.2
The Knox/Sollecito case is a helpful reminder of the benefits of ignoring the chaff that is put out right after an arrest.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0699.3
I can understand why people would have thought Knox and Sollecito guilty if they listened to the statements made by police and prosecutors, many of which were false.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0699.4
Ditto with respect to the three defendants in the Duke lacrosse case.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0699.5
Innocent until proven guilty is not just a good idea; it's the law.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0699.6
Yet this standard doesn't mean much if the jurors have already made up their minds.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0699.7
Nor does it serve any purpose for the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/13/usa-crime-coach-governor-idUSN1E7AC05920111113">Governor of Pennsylvania</a> to weigh in on McQueary's moral obligations, although at least he has not been indicted (in which case the Governor should keep completely quiet).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0699.8
You are correct that innocent until proven guilty would still apply even if we had a video tape of the alleged rape in the DL case or the sexual assault/murder in the Knox/Sollecito case.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0699.9
Fortunately the alleged acts in each of these two cases flew in the face of the laws of physics and physiology.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0699.10

Why do you suppose the Gov went on public record?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0699.14
He's one of the trustees who is absolutely responsible for the mess at Penn State.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0699.15
He gets to cover his ass (probably a well-advised move here) while placing all the responsibility on the Penn State administration.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0699.16
By Sandusky's own admission, this stuff has been going on for years although he 'defends' himself by downplaying the blatant sexual assault aspect of his behaviour.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0700.1
I don't know if Paterno and Sandusky were close at one point but I get the impression that by the time Sandusky left Penn State they were on the outs.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0700.2
Sandusky had the 1998 incident and according to the GJ report not too long after that one of the victims said Paterno told him he wouldn't be the next head coach of PSU and Sandusky was upset about it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0700.3
And then one year later he retired.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0700.4
I've read that at Sandusky's retirement party Paterno made only a brief appearance and said only a few words whereas if they were close at that point you'd think Paterno would do and say a lot more at Sandusky's going away party.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0700.5
I don't know if Paterno ever said anything to Sandusky about his behavior but he must have known at least about the 1998 incident (before 2002 happened I mean) and maybe that's what turned him cold to Sandusky, or maybe he was cold to him already.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0700.6
I read an column the other day about a guy that was an assistant coach at PSU in the 1980s and a victim of sexual abuse himself as a child and it was fairly scathing of PSU.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0700.7
But anyway, the reason I bring it up is that he said that Sandusky used to tell him that he hated Paterno.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0700.8
So who knows?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0700.9
Maybe it was a case of guys that didn't get along personally but who tolerated each other professionally because doing so helped the football program.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0700.10
The potential cover-up is as bad as the original series of crimes IMO.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0700.11
That shouldn't just be swept under the rug while all the focus is on Sandusky and his behaviour.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0700.12
I hope they have the equivalent of a Royal Commission to investigate just how far the information traveled about Sandusky.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0700.13
It would also help to examine other programmes and root out this problem once and for all.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0700.14
If Sandusky were the only athletic official to have ever faced such charges then I might not be so concerned but read up on the Theoren Fleury situation in hockey.

bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0701.5
Well, in this instance, it isn't very difficult for the average person to come to the conclusion that Sandusky is lying through his lying teeth.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0702.1
It doesn't even make any sense.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0702.2
He says he stopped it...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0702.3
so where's the kid?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0702.4
Well no, he didn't say he stopped it; he said he "made sure it stopped" which is much more unspecific and sounds like he's setting up some kind of plausible deniability.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0703.3
Especially if the "pimping out to boosters" thing is true.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0703.4
We haven't heard anything on that in a few days.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0704.4
Why didn't he bring the kid to a hospital, or stay with the kid until the police arrived?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0704.5
Why did he just send Sandusky on his merry way if he was present enough to intervene and stop it?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0704.6
Also, I've heard reports that McQueary continued to work on children's charity events with Sandusky after he saw Sandusky raping that kid.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0704.7
Let's say he did perjur himself.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0704.8
He did hollar or clock Sandusky and made sure he stopped raping the kid.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0704.9
But then he just left the just raped kid by himself and went off to his dad, not following up with the police or a hospital?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0704.10
How did he know Sandusky didn't go right back and continue raping him?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0704.11
He also continued to watch Sandusky interact with kids knowing he was a child rapist.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0704.12
Even this new whitewashed version of events doesn't exactly reflect well on him.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0704.13
Also, if he did lie to the grand jury, why would he tell that lie?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0704.14
There is NO motivation, no incentive, nothing to be gained, in telling the public that 'truth' but the grand jury that 'lie'.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0704.15
It only makes rational and logical sense if he told the grand jury the truth, but is lying to the public.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0705.1
They've started the pushback against McQueary's story:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0705.2
<a href="http://www.tmz.com/2011/11/15/jerry-sandusky-lawyer-mcqueary-liar/">http://www.tmz.com/2011/11/15/jerry-...mcqueary-liar/</a>
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0705.3
That is interesting that the lawyer says he "thinks he may have found the kid in question and he says it never happened".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0705.4
Given how many kids Sandusky showered with, I wonder what makes him sure he's talking to the right one.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0705.5
In any case, it doesn't much matter at the very end of the day.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0705.6
The indictment has testimony from six other kids who are adamant that things happened to them, so...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0706.1
The potential cover-up is as bad as the original series of crimes IMO....
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0706.2
Really?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0706.3
In this case the original crimes were many magnitudes worse than the cover up IMO, and I frankly cannot fathom anyone saying or thinking otherwise.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0706.4
And certainly the cover up may have, and probably did allow for further incidents of abuse; but only in this aspect did the cover up even approach a somewhat similar level of seriousness to the multiple incidents of child rape and molestation.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0707.5
If the individual said it did not happen (which is what <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/133872183.html">Amendola</a> is suggesting), the the 2002 incident should no longer be in the indictment.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0707.6
This might take McQueary out of the picture.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0707.7
I think that William Anderson was correct to question why the 2002 incident was part of the indictment, for reasons already given.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0708.4
If the cover up did in fact facilitate more molestations, I suppose one could argue that it's all part of the same big predatory "event".
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0709.2

However, KC Johnson, the premier blogger on the Duke lacrosse case, has some <a href="http://durhamwonderland.blogspot.com/2011/11/duke-penn-state.html">interesting observations</a> on the present one: "The university reappointed its president, and retained the same faculty hiring patterns that appeared to foster the rush-to-judgment attitude.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0710.6
It doesnt appear that even any of the faculty members were punished in any way for their dubious and in a few cases unethical conduct.

McLaughlin said, after repressing the memories of his alleged abuse, that he decided to confront Neisworth over the phone in 2001 as part of his therapy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.3
He tape-recorded the conversation, in which he claims that the professor admitted to performing oral sex on him.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.4
"I was in the process of trying to get him to open up about some of the sexual acts and what not, and he actually interrupted me and says, 'Do you remember driving up on the hill?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.5
'" McLaughin said.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.6
"I said, 'Wasn't that the first time you went down on me?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.7
' He said, 'I don't know if it was the first time but it was certainly fierce,' was his words."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.8
Over the course of a few months from the end of 2001 into early 2002, McLaughlin said he sent his taped conversation with Neisworth to university officials, but each time he was "rejected."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.9
"They didn't want copies of the tape recorded conversation.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.10
They didn't want to hear it, period," he said.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.11
"It was extremely emotional for me to have to make these calls to begin with, but then to be rejected the way I was and basically treated as if I had done something wrong in making those calls."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.12
McLaughlin said he spoke with one Penn State official on the phone at the time who refused to even investigate his claim.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.13
"They said don't bother sending it we're not interested in fabrications, stories, any attempts at extortion or blackmail.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.14
I mean, they made it seem like I was looking for something for myself," McLaughlin said.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.15
"I didn't ask them for money.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.16
I didn't ask them for anything other than make sure they look into this.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.17

bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.18
McLaughlin said he also spoke with former Penn State president Graham Spanier on the phone within two weeks of allegations being made about former defensive football coach Jerry Sandusky sexually abusing young boys.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.19
Spanier and head football coach Joe Paterno were fired last week in the wake of the accusations, which were first reported on Nov. 5. McLaughlin said he was met with the same "hostility" that he had received from other university officials.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.20
"[Spanier] told me that as far as he was concerned it was hearsay, '[Neisworth] has an impeccable record.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.21
He has never been accused of anything,'" McLaughlin said.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.22
"They were more interested in protecting the school.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.23
They didn't seem to have any interest in protecting children at all."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.24
Neisworth was later charged with multiple counts of child sexual abuse in Cecil County, Md., in 2005.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0790.25
However, McLaughlin claimed that at the time, Penn State officials said an indictment wasn't enough to investigate one of their faculty members.

bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0791.3
I mean, there is something physically wrong with your brain.

If you want to have sleep overs with kids (as in, M.J. did), there is also something wrong with your brain.

All I'm saying is that when thousands of children were being molested in the '60's, the public did not respond to it the way they can and will today.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0897.7
It's my opinion that I fail to see how any adult couldn't do all in his power and beyond it if possible to try to stop ongoing pedophilia of which he was aware.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0897.8
I fail to see what he's got to be confused about.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0897.9
That he can somehow find some way to justify it to himself concerns me not in the least, nor does it garner my empathy or sympathy.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0897.10
Describing a person's possible motives or thinking does not imply empathy or sympathy.

They are relevant because they indicate that during the 1980s, the culture took the issue very seriously.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0898.2
The charges were nonsense, but they do not reduce the conclusion that the culture took the charges seriously.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0898.3
In fact, it was quite the opposite.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0898.4
The charges were taken so seriously because, even though the charges were nonsense, people were so outraged that they wanted to make them stick at any cost.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0898.5
That event, therefore, gives the lie to @Mary_H's claim.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0898.6
Which is the point.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0898.7
I would suggest that the '80's were when making a big deal out of sexual abuse finally became okay for some parts of the population.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0898.8
Obviously, though, even the '80's were too soon for the population of Happy Valley.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0899.3
And again, you haven't provided anything to back this up.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0899.4
You haven't shown it wasn't a code of silence as opposed to tacit acceptance.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0899.5
You've not done anything but make declarations of fact with no evidence whatsoever.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0900.4
What is the difference between a code of silence and tacit acceptance?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0900.5
Do I really need evidence to establish that culture changes over fifty years?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.1
In trying to refute my own claim, I looked for evidence of public sexual abuse scandals before the '80's.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.2
I haven't found anything yet, but I came across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_sex_abuse_cases">this interesting information in Wikipedia</a> :

Third Reich 19331945
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.5
During the Nazi era, false cases of sexual abuse were fabricated to malign the Catholic Church.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.6
The "immorality trials" (Sittlichkeitsprozesse) of Catholic priests in April and May 1937 are the prime examples of this phenomenon.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.7
[40] In these trials, innocent priests and members of religious orders became the target of accusations of luring children and youth into sexual acts.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.8
Staged trials of Franciscan friars held in 1936 did not receive the media attention the National Socialist regime hoped for; and this was not the only problem.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.9
In a case that would eventually be dismissed as baseless the alleged victim, when asked at trial if the offender was in the courtroom, pointed to the president of the court.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.10
[41] Hence, in order to show that the "offences against morality" were a massive problem within the Catholic Church, the regime ordered that individual cases should be accumulated at a more opportune moment.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.11
A large number of cases were brought to trial in the spring of 1937.

Stefan Micheler writes:
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.13
Over the course of eight weeks between April and June, the daily and party newspapers and radio devoted extensive, front-page coverage to the trials...
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.14
The coverage focused on the seduction of children and youth, the exploitation of relationships of dependence, and the abuse of rank and office.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.15
The press ignored cases where investigations were dropped or trials resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence or ill-founded accusations.

In a speech at Berlin's Deutschlandhalle on May 30, 1937, Joseph Goebbels stated in front of 25,000 people that the "criminal aberrations of the Catholic clergy threaten the physical and moral health of our young people."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.18
He declared that the "plague" would be "radically extirpated."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.19
The speech was spurred on by the crowd's repeated cries of "Hang them!
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.20
Massacre them!"

[41] Florence Tamagne writes: "The anti-Catholic campaign continued until 1941.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.22
By 1936, all the Catholic youth organizations had been closed down."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.23
However, she also notes that, of approximately 20,000 German priests, "only 57 were convicted; of 4,000 members of the regular clergy, only 7 were convicted.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.24
Lastly, of 3,000 lay brothers, 170 were convicted, mostly Franciscans."
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.25
[41] According to reports published by SoPaDe, the propaganda nature of the trials was widely recognized by both Catholics and Protestants.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0901.26
Nevertheless, as a result of the trials, children and youth would often avoid socializing with Catholic priests.

bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0902.5
My recollection is that it hasn't, at least in regard to adults and actual children (sub-15 year olds).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.1
Emphasis mine - I didn't mean to imply that people in Paterno's generation actually give a lot of conscious thought to the victims or consider why they are reluctant to talk about sexual abuse.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.2
I can picture Paterno thinking "Geez, that poor kid" when he first heard about this, and then never considering the victim again.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.3
Yeah, although I readily admit I of course don't know this to a certainty, that's my best guess to how this went down as well as far as Paterno's concerned.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.4
There wasn't overt acceptance of this kind of stuff before but I think there was a kind of implicit acceptance.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.5
I grew up in the 70s and it wasn't so much that it was accepted but rather it just wasn't an issue one way or the other.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.6
The McMartin stuff, which was in the 80s, was the first I can remember even hearing about or thinking of the notion of child sexual abuse.

As bad as these scandals are (Catholic Church, PSU) I think in the long run they do broader good in the sense that they make the next scandal less likely to happen and they make people less likely to remain quiet when they hear something or something happens to them.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.8
I think PSU was the perfect storm.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.9
There probably aren't many assistant coaches at top flight football schools that are child molesters but this one just happened to be at a school where the coach was a legend that had been there forever, and not just winning but running a "clean" program in the sense that historically mattered such as making your players go to class and not paying them money under the table.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.10
And yet since he (Paterno) was so old and society had changed so much, he wasn't up to speed on just how bad the actions were.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.11
And the guys running the school, who were more up on things, felt they had to defer to the legend Paterno and/or protect the program that had been built up for so long.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.12
You'd have a hard time writing something like this story.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.13
I read a few times, and maybe one of them was earlier in this thread, that in 2005 or so the PSU President and Athletic Director when to Paterno's house to try to talk him into retiring and he turned them down.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.14
In normal times that may just give your football program some extra down years while it's being run by someone too old to be running it but in this case it happened to also be enabling a serial child molester.

There definitely was a sea change during the 1970s.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.18
Still, putting this forth as if it were relevant to anything in the past 30 years is inane and just shows the power of the myth of Legendary Joe Paterno.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.19
Not having known anything different, it's so weird to me that things used to be this way.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.20
That is, that child sex abuse was so often just swept under the rug.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.21
Particularly because people used to be so much more uptight about sex and how dangerous and corrupting it is.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0931.22
You'd think people who thought non procreative sex was so terrible and awful would be more concerned about child molestors and exposing them, not less.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0932.1
Not as long as I have been alive (I'm 30).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0932.2
Maybe 50 years ago, though, I wouldn't know about that.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0932.3
This did not happen 50 years ago.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0932.4
I do not understand your repeated attempts to rewrite history and make it seem like this is a societal development of the last 5 years, especially considering it requires you to completely ignore the absolute hysteria of the 80s over child sex abuse.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0932.5
When I was a kid, just about every family sitcom had a "very special episode" in which one of the child characters found out a friend was being abused in some way, and then went and told a parent or teacher, who then contacted the authorities.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0932.6
You're misreading me if you think I am trying to rewrite history or even trying to argue with anybody.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0932.7
People in the Penn State system knew about Sandusky's proclivities for decades, but the case didn't get to the Grand Jury until 2009.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0932.8
'Nuff said?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.1
- Many people here and elsewhere continue to suggest Paterno not doing more made him an enabler of child sexual abuse.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.2
This is by and large an incredibly unfair label to stick on him.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.3
For one, had the investigation back in 1998 been handled correctly this would never have become an issue.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.4
So, far more to the truth, ALL those who failed back in 1998 are the true enablers.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.5
Secondly, several people either witnessed or were directly told of Sandusky raping a young boy in the showers in 2000 and they did NOTHING.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.6
They did not stop it, they did not report it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.7
They swallowed their tongues.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.8
They are all far more culpable than Paterno.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.9
What do all these things that other people did or didn't do have to do with judging Paterno's actions?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.10
He can't be a child abuse enabler because other people also had a chance to do something and didn't?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.11
That's must makes all of them enablers, including Paterno.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.12
Another point: With the benefit of hindsight we are outraged by the 40 counts related to sexual abuse and 9 or more victims.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.13
But that's the result of an investigation that went on for over three years.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.14
We assume Paterno had to know a lot since he was everything to Penn State, but how much did he really know?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.15
As far as I know, it was the 1998 and 2002 incidents, nothing more.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.16
Should that be enough?..
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.17
yeah, I think so.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.18
But it's NOT the 40 counts and 9+ victims everyone is judging him by. I think in order to form a final opinion of just how culpable Paterno truly is, we have to first understand exactly what he knew, both in terms of the allegations made against Sandusky and what actions were taken to resolve it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.19
How many times do we hear the phrase "how could they not have seen what was going on" when in fact, they honestly didn't.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.20
(this speaks directly to the accusation of being an enabler, which to me is a conscious action or role.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.21
But if you simply did not see what was going on, for whatever reason, then you can't be an enabler).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.22
I can't speak for anyone else, but my decision is based solely on the fact that, regardless of how the 1998 incidents turned out, Paterno deliberately downplayed the 2002 incident while knowing that Sandusky had been accused before for the same thing by different kids.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.23
I'm judging him on what he did, not how many counts Sandusky was indicted on.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.24
And finally, I have often heard the commentary that this was a cover-up to protect the school or football program, but I still don't understand what this exactly means.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.25
Typically, if you are protecting the school or football program, you are hiding activity taken by the school or football program that benefited the school or the football program.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.26
But when it was first discovered that Sandusky was sexually abusing children, this had nothing to do with the school or the football program per se.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.27
It was entirely about a sexual predator that managed to operate within the confines of the school and it's football program while going undetected.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.28
The school had nothing to gain but everything to lose by hiding it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.29
Exactly how would it have hurt the school or the football program if Sandusky was exposed right from the start?
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.30
And remember, back in 1998 the relationship between Paterno and Sandusky was very strained.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.31
They never really cared for one another to begin with, but it had gotten far worse over the last few years Sandusky was there.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.32
To suggest that Paterno would have known exactly what Sandusky was alleged to have done and opted to protect him, for reasons I can't fathom, seems very unlikely.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.33
So what am I missing??
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.34
Paterno lost his job because of what Sandusky did.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.35
Surely he was intelligent enough to foresee that possibility.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0970.36
I'm not sure it's beyond the pale to suggest that Paterno may have considered his own firing to be a negative turn of events that the football program needed to be protected from.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0971.1
I have participated actively in this thread for a few reasons.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0971.2
One is that it's helped me come to grips with this tragedy that implicates people and an institution that I admire(d).
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0971.3
A big reason, though, has been for accuracy's sake.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0971.4
I know a lot more about Paterno than most people do, and characterizations of him as some evil mastermind valuing a winning football program above all else - morality be damned - are flat wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0971.5
If for no other purpose than for people who don't know anything about the man to get the tragic irony of this case (i.e., that it involves the squeakiest of the squeaky-clean) it's been important to set the record straight.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0971.6
It's easy to just conclude that his response makes him a total low-life; the truth is more complicated: he really is a man of impeccable character who did absolutely the wrong thing when presented with this situation, and he deserves to be punished for it.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0971.7
Vicki Triponey's comments suggest that he did indeed value his football program above many more important things.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0971.8
Power corrupts, and this scandal has shown pretty clearly that Paterno was no exception to that rule.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0971.9
I'm sorry, but I think you're reacting out of emotion because you bought into the myth of Paterno as the squeakiest of the squeaky clean.

He was not some wonderful man who inexplicably did a bad thing.
bolt-eng-DF-201-185522-352056_0971.11
He was a fallible being, like all of us, who did good and bad things.

Better he should be remembered that way than as some phony secular saint.

I don't think alimony needs to keep the lesser earning spouse up in the "lifestyle to which they had become accustomed" indefinitely, but I do think that a lot of times spouses (usually women) put their careers on the back burner to support the breadwinning spouse.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0019.2
They miss out on income and earning potential/career growth/education while boosting those same things for their spouse.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0019.3
If they divorce, I think they deserve at least some money as compensation for what they gave up and to help them get back on their feet.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0019.4
This is extremely well said.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0019.5
Where I bristle at it is in situations where the decision for one spouse to stay home wasn't made together.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0019.6
Like, the wife unilaterally decides to stop working, or one spouse is completely unable to hold a job because s/he is immature, lazy, etc. I'm not sure what percentage of alimony payments go to people like this, but it makes me uncomfortable that it can happen and I judge the hell out of people like that that demand and accept alimony.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0019.7
It's hard for a third party to say in retrospect whether it was a mutual decision or not, but if one spouse has been out of work for many years, it kind of seems like the courts have to assume the other spouse must have been okay with it for the marriage to have lasted so long.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0020.1
How about this situation: 2 people get married as undergrads, graduate with their bachelor degrees, and make the decision that person A will work and support person B + kids while person B gets their graduate degree, then person B will work while person A gets their graduate degree.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0020.2
Person B asks for a divorce 6 months before getting their degree.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0020.3
you JUST described my parents - my mom DID get alimony for a few years (5 or so).
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0021.1
I'm coming from a different perspective but it isn't out of date.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0021.2
I stopped practicing law when we had kids because one of our careers needed to go on the back burner.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0021.3
Since DH and I have been together and I stopped practicing, his income has more than doubled.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0021.4
Because I do 95% of the child rearing/cooking/cleaning he is able to do what he does.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0021.5
I still work part time, but my earning potential is not even close to what it was before I stopped practicing if I ever needed to go back full-time.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0021.6
We made this choice together and if he decides to run off with callista gingrich why should my standard of living suffer?
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0021.7
I can understand why it would be necessary in your situation, but I think it needs to have a defined time limit.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0021.8
My perspective is coming from the fact that I'm divorced and my XH tried to milk me for everything I'm worth, even though he cheated on me.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0021.9
Michigan is a no-fault divorce state, so had we have been married longer or if he was laid off before our divorce, could have been responsible for spousal support.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0021.10
I'm just a really independent and wouldn't need or want anyone supporting me.
bolt-eng-DF-203-185940-353667_0021.11
I would figure it out on my own.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.1
Hi Everyone......
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.2
Have found an open computer at the library so thought it was a good time to let you know how things are.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.3
The fire on Tuesday gutted the pumphouse, a 6'x6'x8' structure.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.4
Hence the name, the well pump was inside and there won't be any water for awhile.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.5
The fire spread to the entryway and pretty much gutted that along with the phone lines.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.6
What is left of the entryway has to come down along with perhaps the outside living room wall and the deck of course.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.7
Somewhere along the line, the fire jumped to the house roof which was very unfortunate.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.8
The fire department had a difficult time extinguishing that portion and roof boards were damaged leaving a hole.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.9
In order to find the real extent of what the fire did, the north wall of the kitchen will need to be removed (inside and out) along with some of the vault down to the studs, and the roof of course.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.10
Due to the age of the home (1890) and the extensive remodeling that has occured before I got there, nothing can be determined from the attic or the roof portion in that particular section unless a tear down occurs.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.11
The house if livable, although without water.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.12
I made a decision to stay in the house and not go to a hotel.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.13
There is some smoke damage and I am finding soot in the weirdest places like behind the top of the toilet tank.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.14
If I can get outside every 4 hours for a breath of fresh air, it's helpful.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.15
The first well pump person came this morning and was of no help.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.16
The second person that came was very helpful and is coming again tomorrow with an estimate.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.17
The adjuster and the contractor are also coming tomorrow and that will all take a couple of hours at least to sort through things.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.18
A structure has to be built first before the pump can be installed.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.19
Was a fitful night for sleep, but it was tempered with the fact that I live in a small community and have people around me that are totally awesome.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.20
From the passerby's Tuesday morning who called 911 and went in the house to rescue any animals at their own peril, to those who lived close and kept me informed and stayed until the rescue people left.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.21
The phone was busy with people calling, sometimes twice
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.23
to make sure that I was OK.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.24
Special thanks have to go out to my assistant Randy, who on the last 10 minutes of my commute was with me via phone the entire time.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.25
I cannot express my gratitude for that action.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.26
The fire was in the same exact location that it was 30 years ago.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0037.27

bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0045.2
Hello everybody,
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0045.3
People started to show up here at 7:30 this morning and it's been quite a flurry of activity.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0045.4
Two contractors, an adjustor, the phone company plus a subrogate investigator.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0045.5
The investigator was called in thinking that the former owners actions had somehow caused the fire with the way the heat tape was being utilized.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0045.6
With that phone call, everything here ground to a halt.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0045.7
Debris could not be removed, the plumber could not commence, nothing could go any further.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0045.8
At 2:30 pm, the investigator did determine that it was the pump motor itself which was the cause, not the former homeowners actions.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0045.9
Since it is so late in the day now, everything has to wait until tomorrow.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0045.10
On Friday, the new pump motor will be put on, and a temporary structure will be built.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0045.11
The entryway will be torn off and debris will be picked up, but far as anything permanent, that is weeks if not months away.
bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3130685_0045.12
Thanks for all your concern.........

As for affairs, well, my Mum had one when I was 16 and left my Dad.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0254.10
I was devastated at the time - called her some names that even now I blush to recall but with the benefit of maturity and some distance I can see that it was the best decision for all concerned.

bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0257.5
I would be more concerned with his short term intentions to be honest,you could spend years listening to excuses and waiting for him to leave.

If you want to be with him you do have to lay your cards on the table,you have to mean it too and be prepared to walk away if he isn't commited to leaving his marriage in the near future.

My husband had a three and a half year affair.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0258.3
He promised her the world, and on the basis of this, she had his baby.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0258.4
He didn't leave me, had no intentions of doing so.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0258.5
She was a convenient physical repository, someone to talk to, someone who thought that the sun shone out of his backside, and he basked in the adulation.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0258.6
When push came to shove, he chose to stay with me.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0258.7
I chose to allow him to do so.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0258.8
I did, however, keep in contact with his mistress, as much to get answers to my myriad of questions as to keep an eye on her.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0258.9
(she was so smitten that she turned down a chance to emigrate to NZ and made a million and one excuses for him when heir child died without him even bothering to visit her ) And, funnily enough, she was shocked when I told her of the affairs he had following the demise of their relationship ; she truly thought that she was the one, rather than a convenience.

bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.3
Bit of background
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.4
Going through a divorce · 3 children
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.5
I had been with my husband for over 20+ years when end of last year, he announced he dont love me know more and was leaving.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.6
he didnt leave that night as he didnt know how to tell the children.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.7
about a week later the phone bill arrived and there was a number i didnt recognised that he had been contacting from the time he got up till the time WE went to bed, for months.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.8
When i confronted him he told me it was a woman from work who was a close friend.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.9
he told the children and left that night.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.10
He moved into his parents and within a few weeks he was sleeping with her.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.11
At first i had the support of his parents but that soon diminished.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.12
As obv they stood by their son.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.13
Roll on too now.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.14
i cant describe to you the hurt and humiliation that you feel.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.15
that everyone knew and was laughing at you, to watch my children crumble before your very eyes, the man they used to look at with such admiration they look at with contempt.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.16
i dont slag him off in front of the children or refuse to allow him contact.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.17
he chooses not to see them unless he can be bothered.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.18
to listen to your kids crying at night as they have been replaced by her children.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.19
Yes he is still with her.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.20
Are they happy i have no clue.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.21
He tells the children he lives with his parents and his parent keep this up he infact stays over every night at her house.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.22
The children do not want to meet her under any circumstances.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.23
so he has to live a lie im not sure if the kids will ever meet her or be told the truth as to where he his living.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.24
We have lost family members that we were very close to how can those trelationships ever be put right.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.25
I try my best to keep going and hold my head up high and keep letting the kids know that they are loved.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.26
but you end up living on your nerves as you are never quite sure whats going to be thrown at you next.

My husband had never been unfaithful before she knew he was married with children as she had met us.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.28
I suspect he has told her he was unhappy etc. Maybe he was BUT we were still intimate right up until he left (do you think he told her that).
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.29
We had plans for the future and were discussing how to make those plans a reality.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.30
So for all you know he could be doing the same to his wife.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.31
I was totally devasted and to some extent still am.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.32
Would i have believed that he was capable of causing so much hurt and devastation.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.33
Never.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.34
He is now not the man i was with for all of those years i dont even recognise him or his actions.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.35
It makes you wonder if the whole of your life has been 1 big lie.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.36
So yes his wife has the right to know i wish someone had told me that he was flirting with someone else whilst making promises to me.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.37
then i wouldnt have felt that he had ripped my heart out of my chest and stamped on it.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0323.38
I would have been prepared for the whole of my life and my kids lives to be turned upside down but most of all i would have had a choice in the outcome.

I think it is actually quite straight forward really.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0435.3
He is either totally sincere, totally confused at what is happening to him, trully totally in love with you, and the only truthful reason why he is still with his wife is because he can't bear not seeing his children regularly any longer.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0435.4
This, unfortunately, although possible, is not the most likely case.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0435.5
However, if it is, he most likely would not be waiting until seeing you again to discuss what you have said to you.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0435.6
He would be calling you, telling you that he has been thinking of what you've said every day, that he understand how you feel and know how totally unfair it is for you to be put in the situation you are in, and that he has decided either to set you free and stop the relationship because there is no way he can take the chance not to have regular contact with his children any longer, or, that he has decided that he couldn't keep expecting you to accept the situation as it is and therefore decided to leave his wife there and then.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0435.7
Or....
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0435.8
he does care very much for you, even probably trully love you, however, not enough to be prepared to leave not just his kids, but maybe the wife who despite what he might say, actually also still love very much, or worse, not leave the comfort that comes with the relationship, or lose out financially through the divorce she will ask for, all the money he worked very hard to earn.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0435.9
However, despite what you told him, he doesn't want to lose what he has with you, and so is most likely to wait until you are meeting again to discuss the conversation, likely to wait until you bring it up again, and likely to give a sob story about how much he loves you, doesn't want to lose you and therefore he has decided to leave his wife, however, he needs to sort out a few things before he does it officially.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0435.10
He will try to keep you hanging on for how long as possible, probably already knowing that the time has come for this arrangement to end, but trying to keep it going and enjoying it for how long as it can last because you start to realise that he trully never intend to leave.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0435.11
One sure thing, you need to separate his feelings for you from the actions he is capable of taking.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0435.12
Even if he does love you as much as you believe he does, it doesn't mean he is trully prepared to leave for many reasons...
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0435.13
even more afraid of any confrontations with his wife than he loves you, even more attached to his financial stability than he loves you, even more concern about his status and what people think of him than he loves you...
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9663137_0435.14
In the end, you are now at the stage where his love his not enough, what you need is action, this means things changing now, when he might decide that a good compromise is just to make promises...

I'm sure your children are worried about you and i'm sure they'd appreciate you telling them how you're feeling, rather than them fretting because they're seeing their Mum upset.

My mum too was my right arm went everywhere together i phoned her every day.

Of course you have the luxury of not having to worry how you going to put food on the table or pay the next electricity bill, but you usually don't get where you are without having worked very hard for it, and the exhaustion that can come with what such a salary entails is not always worth it.

Get them charged.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0037.3
On 29 Dec a few years ago me and my friend were walking up the street to catch a taxi.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0037.4
We had had words with a man in a nightclub earlier, he was from Nigeria, I dont remember exactly what had happened in the nightclub but I think he had come on to my friend and she turned him down and he didnt like it.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0037.5
Anyway he caught up with us as we were walking to the taxi, he ended up arguing with me mainly, he went to punch me, my friend pushed me out of the way, and then he punched her in the face.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0037.6
He broke her jaw in 3 places, a couple of lads were across the street and they chased him but didnt manage to catch him (they were chavs)
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0037.7
We went to hopsital as she was in pain and it was confirmed that she had a broken jaw, we reported it to the police and they took us in for a interview, we were interviewed seperate.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0037.8
They somehow knew who we were talking about, he must have been known to them as they showed us a pic of a man and it was him.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0037.9
So then we went to court, and thankfully one of the chavs had offered to be a witness as well, I was bricking it to stand up in court
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0037.10
But thankfully when he arrived in court too, he saw that all 3 witness'es had turned up he changed his plea to guilty
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0037.11
He got sent to jail for 6 months and the was being deported.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0037.12
So its def worth reporting it
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0037.13
Again, very different circumstances to what happened to the OP's DD. A broken jaw in an unprovoked attack with independent witnesses to give evidence is very different from "bruising" following a spat in a club that's spilled out onto the street.

I am very very suprised by the actions of the police in this case.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0039.3
If a crime is committed surely they are duty-bound to investigate and prosecute, rather than just leaving it up to the victim to decide?
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0039.4
It's up to the POLICE to check cctv - that's their job for heaven's sake.

Remember the hoo-haa about the Jordan rape claim a little while back?
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0039.6
The police questioned her even though she was adamant she didn't want to do anything about it.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0039.7
That's what they are supposed to do - or else surely they are just allowing people to get away with stuff due to witnesses/victins feeling vulnerable?
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0039.8
My friend's OH was set upon by a group of lads outside a pub in the early hours and even though he was drunk and probably behaving provocatively the police were very professional and used cctv evidence to prosecute.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0039.9
His attacker got 6 months and had to pay him compensation.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0039.10
What they'll often do if there's been a melee outside a club and the person who has been assualted refuses to press charges, is charge the protagonists with a public order offence (if they have the CCTV or other solid evidence to back it up) usually section 4, or a more serious section 3 affray if there's a large number of people causing trouble.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0039.11
I'm surprised by your second point though - normally when someone is sent to prison they don't have to pay compensation as well as they would be deemed to have no way to pay it (because they're in prison, obviously).

Both lads went to prison "briefly" but at least they may just think twice before doing it again.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0040.5
Both lads had viewed a fight as part of a normal night out beforehand.

Your daughter is what we call in the trade an unreliable witness.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0041.2
She got thrown out of the club for some reason.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0041.3
I'm sure the club will give the police full details.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0041.4
She was too drunk to give an account of what happened to the police at the time - that's not a good starting point for a prosecution.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0041.5
There are CCTV pictures which may well show (and you have to be prepared for this) things you would rather not see - eg daughter mouthing off.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0041.6
You've only got one side of the story.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0041.7
I suspect that once the police have interviewed club staff, seen the CCTV and interviewed the other parties they'll come up with a less clear-cut picture of what happened.
bolt-eng-DF-225-196010-9672805_0041.8
In fact, your daughter may find herself facing a prosecution for a public order offence.

Jesus was never in the bar and didn't know what had happened in there.
bolt-eng-DF-228-194843-7119146_0205.2
He was inside playing video games and had gone outside to move his car when he encountered the two.
bolt-eng-DF-228-194843-7119146_0205.3
Whatever happened then is what lead up to the shooting.
bolt-eng-DF-228-194843-7119146_0205.4
After shooting he immediately called the police and waited for them.
bolt-eng-DF-228-194843-7119146_0205.5

bolt-eng-DF-231-195133-7292503_0163.4

bolt-eng-DF-231-195133-7292503_0163.5
"So he put out a statement on PA to spike their scoop and make clear that despite his condition, Fraser was fit and healthy.

bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.10
used to, if you had experience since the Jurassic era and had a Master's or Doctorate.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.11
I heard with the exception of CA, AK, HI and NY, it's still like this in the other 46 states.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.12
Now I dunno many teachers who make more than $75-80k/yr. from my old high school due to ed cuts.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.13
But they get a lot of time off, too.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.14
One of my friends is a teacher, and she takes a lot of trips.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.15
So if you've seen why my tirades have gone so much against conservatives during my time here last year, that's why. The $250,000 mark is roughly 1.5%.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.16
I know Savage belongs to this elite 1.5%, but I do not.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.17
I had said in another board that I would make a vow to consistently get to the $250k mark before I died, even if it killed me, so that they have no purpose to call me "lazy" or "entitled".
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.18
I don't direct those tirades at CFers, or CFers in the Tea Party.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.19
I direct them at Tea Partiers I know who are like this and talk show hosts/politicians who subscribe to this way of thinking since my chances of actually saying it to their face are near zero.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.20
So I just hope Savage or Limbaugh slips into CF one day, finds my tirade, and then goes bananas over it.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.21
Rush has a bit of an ego.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.22
So does Hannity.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.23
Sometimes I listen because they're less annoying that the stupid Canadian radio stations that drive me up the wall.

I live in a 1-bedroom apartment.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.25
The other complaint I heard from my parents and other peers from the TP are why don't I get a house.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.26
Simple.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.27
I don't feel like getting one right now.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.28
The market isn't going to go up for at least 3-4 years for houses I feel.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.29
And I want to wait until I can move my g/f to Vegas from Minnesota before we do anything like that.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.30
Yeah, it makes sense in your situation.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.31
I live in a three bedroom house.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.32
It's small, but for me, it makes more sense than renting because I've got a steady job where I'll likely be employed for a while.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.33
I got my house from a guy who used to be a stock broker, then retired from that and started a non-profit to build affordable houses.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.34
I was making $33k/yr at that time.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.35
He advised me to buy a house because he thinks that inflation is going to start hitting.

I LOVE Jerry Doyle.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.38
The comparison between him and the other 3 guys on the KDWN regular lineup (Levin, Savage, Beck) are AMAZING.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.39
I have recommended him to even liberals who just want a different outlook.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.40
He has such an intellectual explanation of everything and I am SO glad that he is a local.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.41
I'd love to meet him and shake his hand for at least TRYING to give an explanation for many of the outlandish remarks, and at many points refuting the more extreme views of the TP.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.42
If you get a chance, you should listen to Dennis Praeger.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.43
When I worked security to put myself through college, I got a chance to listen to his show and I really liked it.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.44
If you have a sarcastic sense of humor you should listen to Suits.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.45
Thanks Panzer.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.46
This was why I felt like leaving CF for a while.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.47
I felt like it was getting too personal with me and other people, and I have conservative friends on here I do respect and wish I could get to know.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.48
A lot of people here seem extremely nice and maybe if we had talked about lighter stuff more and a lot of this stuff less, we wouldn't have so many issues with "Liberals are blah blah blah" or "Conservatives are blah blah blah."
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.49
Liberals are wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.51
I like the no A/C idea though.
bolt-eng-DF-241-201386-14687314_0019.52
One tries.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.1
Certainly there must be a few dissidents here or there, but the majority really do believe everything they are taught.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.2
There is no reason for them not to.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.3
From birth they are conditioned and never hear an alternate version of anything.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.4
Very successful indoctrination.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.5
That indoctrination of the Juche philosophy manifests the isolation and paranoia.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.6
It's a philosophy of self reliance.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.7
One of their favorite mottos is "We have nothing to envy".
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.8
They believe they are the pure race.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.9
The people think South Korea is a hell hole and that the North is a heaven.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.10
It's not as if these people know they are being suppressed or know that it is wrong (besides those in the slave camps perhaps).
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.11
Through their propaganda they wake up each morning thinking "today is when the US attacks".
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.12
They delude themselves into thinking the suppression is simply "what needs to be done" in order to defend themselves.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.13
Despite this brainwash the North Koreans as a people are extremely humble and pleasant.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.14
When I was visiting I was told at all times what to do.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.15
I could not leave my guides side.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.16
He told me who to talk to, what to eat, where to sleep, what to take photos of.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.17
However I did get to talk to quite a few people in impromptu settings.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.18
They are very curious about me and the world, but nothing will stray them from their brainwash.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.19
No no way did I try to argue with them, it would be a waste and very very rude.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.20
A few times I tried to tell them I was American (i figured out the Korean word) and some of the facial expressions were great, most didn't believe me.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.21
Thought I was British.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.22
It was a completely bizarre but fascinating place that is very misunderstood (not to say nothing is wrong).
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.23
Here are my public photos if you are interested.

I even met with a 4 star General at the DMZ!
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0026.25
We talked and he mentioned he wanted peace with the US.

Isn't that the issue lisab pointed out?

It doesn't take a lot of effort to plan a tour that will only show you the rich/patriotic parts of the country.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0027.3
Of course, they showed me what they wanted me to see, no doubt about that.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0027.4
In my mind I often "joked" about what was on the other side of that hill.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0027.5
However Pyongyang and the other few cities I visited are quite large and you can't stage everything.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0028.1
Awesome pictures, Greg.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13463941_0028.2
I'm speechless at the guts that it took to go there.

They didn't finish it in time after all.

Did cannabis suddenly become more dangerous when it was upgraded from class c to class B?
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0031.3
Yes it did become more dangerous.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0031.4
Nationally, skunk smokers are ending up ill in hospital in record numbers, with admissions soaring 73 per cent.

Hospital hotspots for cannabis abuse include Manchester, London, Cheshire and Merseyside.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0031.8
And, as the debate over the drug's dangers continues, figures released by the National Treatment Agency for Substance Abuse (NTA) show that more than 24,500 people are in drug treatment programmes for cannabis  the highest ever.

Why is MDMA class A when it is safer than horse riding?
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0031.11
Because the criteria for classification as a Class A drug have less to do with death rates and more to do with the fact that when it was classified as Class A, it had no medicinal use and was believed to be a hallucinogen like LSD.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0032.1
Yes I am serious.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0032.2
Both are addictive,

You can list the traits, but just because they share the traits, that doesn't mean they share them equally.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.2
That's a pretty basic logical fallacy that would allow you to throw sugar and chocolate into the same category!
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.3
The level of addictiveness, level of mood alteration, and level of damage are just not comparable.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.4
In particular, alcohol is not inherrently chemically addictive.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.5
Certain people are succeptible to alcohol addiction via genetic defect, but that disease does not affect a large part of the population (9% according to the wiki).
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.6
That is stakly different from hard drugs (or even nicotine or caffiene, for that matter), which can cause chemical addiction in virtually everyone who uses them.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.7
Alcohol also has a safe dosage, so use does not automatically imply misuse or any negative consequences at all.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.8
Hard drugs do not have dosage levels where they have limited physiological effects (that, of course, would defeat the purpose for taking them).
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.9
It helps to point out the logical flaw and rediculousness of the claim to push it to it's logical extent.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.10
You are the one who is broadening the definitions and criteria to the point of uselessness in order to include alcohol in the same category as hard drugs.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.11
By broadening it further, chemisttree emphasizes the logical flaw and forces you to (traps you into) address[ing] it.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.12
Ie, now that you acknowledge that broadening the criteria too far results in rediculousness, you should make an attempt to justify why your broadening of the criteria doesn't also result in rediculousness.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.13
Wow only 9% of the population is genetically predispositioned to becoming an alcoholic, I just checked the population of the U.S. and as of July 08 it was 303,524,640 and 9% of that is a bit over 37 million, quite an insignificant number indeed.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.14
One does not have to be an alcoholic to abuse alcohol unfortunately.

bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.17
I am sure that many of them were not alcoholics but that makes little difference.

Every one of those 10 fatals involved alcohol.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.20
In one instance our driver was drunk in 7 it was drunk drivers hittng our trucks and in two instances it was people under the influence using our trucks as a means of suicide.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.21
One by throwing himself under the wheels as the truck pulled away from a cafe and another where a young lady, under the influence, had a fight with her boyfriend, demanded that he stop and let her out.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.22
When he did, she ran out into the freeway and stood in front of our truck.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0035.23
Our driver tried to stop and tried to evade her but she moved back in front of the truck.

I doubt seriously that you can get the same results with coffee or chocolate.

Just a thought but if alcohol is not addictive, why did so many people risk fines and jail to drink it during prohibition when they could have just drank coffee or ate a Hershey Bar.

when you are adicted to it.

However, recreational use is possible.

bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0036.6
The problem with hard drugs is that recreational usage is not really possible.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13466599_0036.7
A serious alcohol adiction is right up there with other hard drugs.

San Francisco is proposing a law that will ban handguns for its residents excluding, of course, the police, military, security and other jobs that require one to own a handgun.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0001.2
I can find no reason for anyone to have a handgun at home or even carry one around.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0001.3
I know this is a hot topic, but thought it would be interesting to see what others' opinions are on the subject.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0001.4
For the general public: · Do you think people should own guns?
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0001.5
Do you think people need to own guns?
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0001.6
Do you think current gun control laws (Federal) are a true form of control?
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0001.7
-- okay obviously I have a bias based on how the question is posed.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0002.1
Banning hand guns just gives criminals more advantage than they already have.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0002.2
I own several guns.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0002.3
I can tell you that since I have owned a handgun I have realized how easy it is to carry one concealed.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0002.4
If criminals knew that most people would cease to carry because it is illegal then doesn't that give them advantages?
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0002.5
The way it is now you NEVER KNOW who is carrying.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0002.6
Doesn't this give the general public an advantage because it is less likely a criminal will try to pull something knowing that he could get a shell in the back of his head because someone could have a gun?
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0002.7
Do you really think gun laws will keep criminals from getting guns?
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0002.8
There are alot more uses for guns than shooting people.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0002.9
If shooting people is the only reason you can think of then YOU are the cold blooded one, not the honest people who choose to own guns and use them responsibly and in some cases actually wear them out.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0002.10
You act as if every gun ever sold has an owner who is just waiting to use it in a murder.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0002.11
I will also tell you that if guns are banned information will pop up everywhere on how to make your own gun.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0002.12
It's really not that hard to make one with some basic metalworking equipment.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0002.13
Guns are too much part of society in the U.S. to change the way people feel about them.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0003.1
To be fair, I should have added a fifth poll choice -- Current Gun Laws need to be revised -- as it is the poll does not consider many aspects of the current gun laws that I find disturbing.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0003.2
For instance, the law requires one to registered and be licensed to own a gun, yet there are no provisions requiring gun owners to update their license when they move or sell their gun.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0003.3
This is a huge loop hole within gun control in my opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0003.4
Another problem is that the turn-around for background checks is only 24 hours -- is that really sufficient time?
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0003.5
With such a powerful item, I think more time should be required.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0003.6
Plus state to state laws differ greatly and I find all sorts of possible dangers that allow criminals to acquire guns too easily.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0030.1
I don't want to "send" my kids to school anyway, but that's irrelevant.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0030.2
Yeah, I would prefer to have my kids in a school where somebody could do something if the school was being taken over.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0030.3
In some places STUDENTS can bring GUNS to school (rifle clubs).
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0030.4
Certainly, but only if you use it incorrectly.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0030.5
Certainly, but again, only if you use these things in ways that were not intended.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0030.6
The spread pattern makes it easier to hit what you are aiming at.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0030.7
The same goes for the fact that its large and has a stock - I don't know if you're a shooter, but for an unskilled shooter, a handgun is extremely difficult to aim.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0030.8
Shotguns also have "stopping power."
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0030.9
I'm not suggesting everyone will be able to go buy a handgun and shoot burglars in the head with 100% accuracy, but that's what shooting ranges are for.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0030.10
If you can't aim a pistol, stay away from them.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0030.11
I've shot them before and didn't find them particularly difficult.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0030.12
Whoa now - "more sophisticated than their military"?
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0030.13
You're suggesting civilians should be allowed to own machine guns, tanks, and rocket launchers?

And this while the country was receiving generous aid: by May of 2001, Washington had delivered 100,000 metric tons of food and the E.U. had spent 200 million euros on relief.

But again we see what little likelihood there is of aid actualy getting to populations in need.
bolt-eng-DF-245-199817-13471816_0030.27
There is every reason to think that these donations have served instead to boost the regime's military arsenal: in 1994, at the height of the famine, North Korea purchased forty submarines from Russia.

The military is so ridiculously powerful compared to the ordinary citizen that nothing is going to happen until weapons of war are captured for a revolt, or a country declares war on North Korea.

The simplest record method is that you get a printed receipt that you can verify matches your intended vote, but without your name on it.
bolt-eng-DF-259-200782-13096251_0187.2
Then you drop that receipt into a box before leaving the polling place.
bolt-eng-DF-259-200782-13096251_0187.3
This would be just like the manual voting cards we used prior to the machines.
bolt-eng-DF-259-200782-13096251_0187.4
If there is any funky number business, then the receipts can be counted by hand.
bolt-eng-DF-259-200782-13096251_0187.5
That's a manual recount.
bolt-eng-DF-259-200782-13096251_0187.6
If you really want to have fun, print the receipts as scantron forms.
bolt-eng-DF-259-200782-13096251_0187.7
Then there is a recountable record that does not have the voter's ID associated, but the voter checks before submitting, that is independent of the electronic record in the machines and any code finagling and whatnot.
bolt-eng-DF-259-200782-13096251_0188.8
I like this idea.
bolt-eng-DF-259-200782-13096251_0189.1

It was taken during the attack in Lahore against the Sri Lankan Cricket Team in February 2009, now see the pictures below, taken during the Mumbai attacks November 2008, the same two terrorists were photographed at both events!

A saffron red thread called a tilak, worn around the wrist is considered to have deep religious significance among Hindus, that's the red bit around his right wrist.
web1-eng-DF-170-181132-1903676_0001.12
So on the one hand since one was wearing a Hindu tilak, it appears certain that the Mumbai attackers were in no way connected to Pakistan at all.
web1-eng-DF-170-181132-1903676_0001.13
On the other, there are reports that at least some of the attackers had stayed at Nariman House, which is an exclusively Jewish hostel in Mumbai prior, which opens up a whole new can of worms so to speak.

The Maryland senator knows a lot about the history of female lawmakers, and she should.

She has made a lot of it herself: the first Democratic woman ever elected to the Senate in her own right; the first woman in the Senate Democratic leadership; and in late 2010 she became the longest-serving woman ever in the Senate.

On October 3, 2005, a Travis County, Texas, Grand Jury indicted Tom DeLay on a felony conspiracy charge to move $190,000 in corporate donations to Republican candidates in the Texas State Legislature in 2002.
web1-eng-DF-183-195685-4581719_0001.3
On October 20, 2005, Tom DeLay turned himself in to the Harris County Sheriff Office, the day after an arrest warrant was issued.
web1-eng-DF-183-195685-4581719_0001.4
He was released after posting a $10,000 bond.
web1-eng-DF-183-195685-4581719_0001.5
On November 24, 2010, DeLay was found guilty by a jury in Austin (Travis County), Texas, of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
web1-eng-DF-183-195685-4581719_0001.6
He was subsequently sentenced to three years in prison and 10 years probation on January 10, 2011.

DeLay's lead attorney has said that he will appeal the convictions.

The Department of Justice seems to be giving the green light to T-Mobile USA in its bid to buy MetroPCS.
web1-eng-DF-183-195726-5326951_0001.5
Today, MetroPCS announced that the DOJ has allowed the waiting period to lapse on the planned merger between the two companies.
web1-eng-DF-183-195726-5326951_0001.6
The waiting period was required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.
web1-eng-DF-183-195726-5326951_0001.7
This indicates that the DOJ doesn't have any objections to the merger.
web1-eng-DF-183-195726-5326951_0001.8
There are still other regulatory approvals the companies must get in order to close the deal.
web1-eng-DF-183-195726-5326951_0001.9
The Federal Communications Commission must approve the transfer of spectrum licenses.
web1-eng-DF-183-195726-5326951_0001.10
There has been some opposition to the merger, including some pushback from labor unions that contend the merger will put jobs in jeopardy.
web1-eng-DF-183-195726-5326951_0001.11
After stating that the merger would create jobs, T-Mobile and MetroPCS recently filed a statement with the FCC admitting that there would be job losses.
web1-eng-DF-183-195726-5326951_0001.12
But the companies said the job losses would be minimal.
web1-eng-DF-183-195726-5326951_0001.13
The companies also need approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment, since T-Mobile is a wholly owned subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, a German telecommunications company.

RIO DE JANEIRO  Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes  Ew, whats that smell?
web1-eng-DF-183-195742-5409283_0001.7
At Ipanema beach in January, the organization Meu Rio staged a protest in an attempt to make it known that thousands of gallons of raw sewage are dumped into the ocean off Rios coast each day.
web1-eng-DF-183-195742-5409283_0001.8
For three months we held protests every weekend to turn an invisible problem into a visible one, Leona Deckelbaum, the campaign coordinator with Meu Rio, said in a recent interview.
web1-eng-DF-183-195742-5409283_0001.9
Only about 34 percent of Rios sewage is treated, and the rest simply washes into the azure waters, giving new meaning to the nautical term poop deck.

Guanabara Bay, the site of several 2016 Olympic sailing events, has 78 times Brazils legally allowed limit of fecal pollution, and 195 times the U.S. limit.
web1-eng-DF-183-195742-5409283_0001.11
In addition to human waste, the bay is also a receptacle for trash from ships and the bay's 15 adjacent communities, as well as toxic runoff from a former landfill.
web1-eng-DF-183-195742-5409283_0001.12
And its not just Guanabarathe ritzy Leblon and Ipanema beach areas are plagued with similar pollution problems.
web1-eng-DF-183-195742-5409283_0001.13
The state environmental agency, INEA, found that Leblon and Ipanema were unfit for swimming for 40 percent of 2011.
web1-eng-DF-183-195742-5409283_0001.14
Botafogo Beach had so much fecal pollution that it did not pass a single INEA test in 2013, according to the BBC.

web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2758745_0001.5
Phoned Amtrak on Wednesday, "we need a consignment number".
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2758745_0001.6
Phoned online company and got it.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2758745_0001.7
Phoned Amtrak "a card was left on Tuesday as you weren't there" (no it wasn't of course), and "we're not allowed to leave it with a neighbour".
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2758745_0001.8
Arranged for another delivery on Saturday.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2758745_0001.9
Arrived home yesterday - it had been delivered next door yesterday, with a card saying this was their first attempt at delivery...
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2758745_0001.10
What a bunch of jokers.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.1
My friend was scammed this christmas and I wouldnt want anyone else to fall prey to these bar*****s
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.2
He answered one of those russian wife emails which are going around at the moment.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.3
When she replied she seemed nice and the photo given was a gorgous young lady.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.4
Ater a few exchanges of emails my friend decided he wanted to meet however there was a catch.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.5
She had no money for the flight.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.6
It would cost £450 + £50 transfer by western union.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.7
Anyway blinded by love or lust he sent the money.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.8
Unfortunately that was not the last he heard from her because she said she will come over christmas.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.9
My friend embarked on a shopping spree.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.10
Pressies and doing up the bedroom to make it their love nest.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.11
He then got an email saying she needed to prove to immigration that she could support herself.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.12
She needed $1500 or £900.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.13
He was dubious but checked with a someone eastern european he was acquainted with, who convinced him it was possible.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.14
Anyway he promptly wired the money over to her.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.15
The day before she was supposed to arrive she got an email.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.16
It said she was on the train after visiting the bank when she was mugged.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.17
She needed more money.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.18
By this time my friend was desperate to meet her.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.19
Without a thought he paid her.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.20
I think you can guess what happened.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.21
Did she show up for Christmas??
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.22
My friend is one of the nicest guys you can meet.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.23
He has been unlucky in love and has 2 small children.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.24
Although sex was probably at the front of his mind I think he genuinely was looking for a companion.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0001.25
He has learnt a valuable less extremely expensively
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0002.1
Too late now, but another variant on advance fee fraud (google for this and/or 419 scam).
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0002.2
Most of them hit one or more of the 7 deadly sins, and there are that many photo's and documents available on t'web these days.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0002.3
He's far from being the only one by the way - these scams rake in several BILLION each year.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0003.1
This is the classic foreighn bride scam - your friend was probably not even communicating with a women at all.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0003.2
Golden Rule is never to send money topeople you don't know and have never met.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0004.1
Remember, Mishka on Neighbours turned up and was a very amazing Russian bride.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0004.2
I'm sure there are good offers out there.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0005.1
im sorry but i have no sympathy at all for him.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0005.2
surely he has read and heard these stories before.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0005.3
how many times did he send money???
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0005.4
id have understood a tad if only once but 3 times, come on, get a grip.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0005.5
These scams happen because people are stupid enough to belive them.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0005.6
dont tell me when you first read the post you first thought wasnt "he hasnt really fallen for that"
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0005.7
tut tut tut, maybe next time he will learn when he gets an email saying he's won the spanish lottery, all he needs to do is send 1000 to release the money!!!!
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0005.8
LOL
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0006.1
There is no way a Russian women can get a VISA to visit the UK on her own simply as a tourist - she would need a UK sponsor, and the VISA would be a fiancee VISA, not a tourist VISA.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0007.1
Someone posted a story very similar to this on the moneysaving marriages forum over xmas.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0007.2
It involved her Dad.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0007.3
Similar thing, she was mugged etc and he had to send more money, but this one did turn up over here.
web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0007.4

You need to check that.

It actually depends on the status of the lady in her own country, but yes she would still need a sponsor.

web1-eng-DF-225-196030-2761483_0010.2
Don't get me wrong - I do feel sorry for the person it happened to - if only for the obvious loneliness which drove a man to the point where all reason flies out of the window but wasn't it a wise woman (or man) who said that God gave Man a brain and a p***s but not enough blood to run both of them at the same time!!!!

Of course, nothing will ever come from these crazy feelings, he's 17 years my senior and married to his soulmate and I'm in love with my boyfriend.
web1-eng-DF-233-195519-1438703_0001.7
It's just wild, but maybe I'm just star-struck.
web1-eng-DF-233-195519-1438703_0001.8
He's the closest thing to a celebrity that I've ever known.
web1-eng-DF-233-195519-1438703_0001.9
He's been on 20/20, MSNBC, CNN, Geraldo...
web1-eng-DF-233-195519-1438703_0001.10
not necessarily famous, but getting there.

anarchist pheramones is all that i can think of to account for how i get caught so much.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.12
all i do is possess drugs!
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.13
i don't steal or bother anybody.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.14
anyway, i recently got out of prison.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.15
(the worst part about going to prison was that they made me comb out my dreads to make sure i wasn't smuggling something in in them.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.16
HA!) so anyway, i'm on parole for a year.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.17
and i have to be in illinois for a year to complete parole.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.18
and i already bought a greyhound ticket to california.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.19
but i'm trying to make myself stay here to complete parole.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.20
because parole is easy.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.21
all i have to do is call them from a land line every week.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.22
and if i'm in another state, and a cop runs my name, it will show up that i'm on parole, so i'll violate and get sent back to prison.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.23
i've already been extradited twice.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.24
it sucks.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.25
so i wanna make myself stay here all year.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.26
it seems impossible.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.27
how do people do it?
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.28
even if i had a place in my name, it would be easy for me to just leave it to go somewhere for a while.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.29
because the same places get boring, and i need to travel.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.30
it's in my blood.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.31
but if i complete parole, i might finally be free to travel without being a fugitive, and then i can just become transient indefinitly, and that's my dream.
web1-eng-DF-233-195605-1308760_0001.32
advice?
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0001.1
Hi, This is what you get for speeding.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0001.2
A spanking.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0001.3
Police sued over alleged paddling of teen for speeding ticket.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0001.4
I think the police went overboard with the spanking of this 16 year old.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0001.5
What do you think of this?
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0001.6

web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0001.7
Thanks, Robert.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0002.1
I would like to see a little background on the cop and the boy.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0002.2
The story seems strangly one sided.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0002.3
It seems like the whole thing is fdrom Mommy's POV.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0002.4
I think she may have just seen a cool opportunity to make a quick 200 grand.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0002.5
On the other hand...
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0002.6
what kind of police dept does this place have?
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0002.7
I would have felt a little strange dishing out that punishment.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0002.8
Sounds like we have a cop who likes to spank teenaged boys.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0003.1
muzikdude, I'm with you on feeling wierd about the cop.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0003.2
I suspect the cop is enjoying the spanking.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0004.1
yeah somethings fishy because fines for speeding tickets are a source of revenue for the town.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0004.2
why'd they give that away and tie up a cops hours in one shot is stupid
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0005.5
Yeah, anybody else catch the pants-down aspect?
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0005.6
This was a sexual assault.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0006.1
That is crazy..
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0008.3
Ewww...
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0008.5
I'm against corporal punishment in general, but this was rather disturbing.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0009.1
First off a 16 year old is more adult than child.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0009.2
Second, there is nothing sexual about paddling a bare bottom unless your into that sort of thing.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0009.3
It was a stupid idea, from a small town cop.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0009.4
Can't say I'm amazed, disturbed or even surprised.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0010.8
Heck yeah!
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0010.9
I think it is hilarious and they should take up the policy.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0010.10
Most kids my age are brash and arrogant and could probably use a paddling.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0011.1
Yeah, at first glance I found the idea to be quite funny.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0011.2
Then I read the article and the mother saying her son, no wait child, was "tramatized".
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0011.3
Yeah, then they called the 16 guy a "child".
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0011.4
Hmm, lets see: consider myself a man, 2 year age difference, *thinks*....
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0011.5
Aha!
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0011.6
I have it!
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0011.7
The guy really is a child becuase he was "tramatized" over a paddling.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0012.1
What I find interesting is that the 16 year old allowed the cop to paddle him, not once, but three times.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.1
I'm sorry, but this is both funny and sick at the same time.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.2
The mother probably agreed so that whatever the child had done would 'go away' and their insurance wouldn't get higher.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.3
The guy, or 'child', probably didn't want to pay the ticket and figured that the 'paddling' would be like the ones his mom/dad probably gave him as a younger child.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.4
Lets face it, parents don't enjoy spanking their kids, as it causes them pain.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.5
I know for a FACT that my mom and dad didn't give me a 'thrashing' as a kid, but I sure didn't want to curse again after getting spanked for saying the word for a person with no father.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.7
The Police is honestly probably a very sick person.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.8
Not once have I EVER heard of a cop giving the people a 'choice' in their ticketing.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.9
He probably saw this as a way to get some of his rocks off, and took the risk.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.10
Now he's gotten introuble for it, and I hope that if his intentions were what I think they were, he gets fired.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.11
There is no need for spanking a 16 year old, let alone even THINKING of trying to do so bare bottom.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.12
~shakes his head~
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.13
If I was this kid, I would never have agreed to it.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.14
Think of the humiliation this boy is going to have have to face in school.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.15
~sigh~.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.16
people always make things harder for themselves.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0013.17
Just pay the ticket and get over it.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0014.3
*chuckles* Auto filter at my board changes that to 'person of illegitimate parentage'.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0014.4
I don't know if the police wanted to do this to 'get his rocks off', but I do know that it was inapropriete.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0014.5
However, I think just about everyone went into fault here: the teenager twice (for speeding AND for agreeing to an alternative punnishment he must have known was illegal), the mother for agreeing to something like this and then sueing over it, and the chief of police for making up such a sick 'program' in the first place.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0014.6
Should the mother sue to get the police chief removed: yes, of course that man should be removed.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0014.7
Should she get even one dollar?
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0014.8
NO!!
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0014.9
She decided to agree when she heard of a program for her 16 year old son that included 15 paddling sessions?
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0014.10
And then there were no alarmbells going off?
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0014.11
But when he came out crying, there were?
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0014.12
I'm sorry...
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0014.13
but no.
web1-eng-DF-241-201379-3780177_0014.15

I'm grateful for this because now I have Medical Insurance, I had started a new job, waited my 3 month period, was SUPER excited about insurance, since I was getting a better insurance than my previous employer, then the insurance company said I had no insurance because I never sent a form in...

Was unreal, I couldn't believe what I was hearing..

web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0001.9
I'm really happy to have insurance, I can get my MRIs done, since I am in Massachusetts now I can go to UMass Hospital which has some of the best Neurologists ( My Neurologist from Connecticut told me this ), get started on medication again..
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0001.11
Today I'm feeling ok..
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0001.12
My job is bothering me a bit, but I'll get over it..
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0001.13
Next week I start working 6 days a week, about 50 hours..
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0001.14
I work for Cingular Wireless and they told me Holiday is the craziest time of the year
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0001.16
This is my first Christmas working for the company so hopefully all will go well...
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0001.17
I know as soon as I get home starting next week I'll most likely just fall
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0001.20
It's going to be hard because I won't see my husband much....
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0001.21
I now have to work on Sundays for the next 7 weeks so I wont be able to go to church or see him...
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0001.22
My only day off will be Monday, and his Wednesday.
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0001.23
Just have to keep alot of prayer
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0001.25
, and keep rejoicing
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0002.1
Well it's Saturday!!!

Here at work until 7....
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0002.3
Snow is everywhere, snowed yeserday until this morning, got a good 4 inches!!!
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0002.4
I can't believe it..
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0002.5
It's almost 2005 already, where has time gone...
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0002.7
I'm looking foward to warm weather already and I have to wait about 5 months to see it!!
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0002.8
lol..
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0002.10
The Lord protected me this morning...
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0002.11
I was driving to work, and hit the brakes too much instead of downshifting and lowering my RPMs, and spun out, I didn't hit anyone thankfully just went into a driveway...
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0002.12
PHEW
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0002.14
What a blessing that was since it's a busy road.
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0002.15
Hallelujah, Hallelujah May everything about me be Hallelujah to my King.

Well it's another Sunday and I'm here at work again!
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.2
Only 5 more Sundays and I'm back to having my Sunday-Monday days off again.
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.4
It's been a crazy week so far, my husband and I are thinking about leaving the crazy weather of Northeast region to move to Florida..
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.5
I know, Florida!!!!
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.6
I have never even been to Florida, lol.
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.7
It's looking pretty positive right now, but he insists that he wants to buy a house, and I want an apartment..
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.8
He's also going to allow me to work part time, and I can go back to college.
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.9
God bless him.
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.10
We told some friends last night, but I only told my auntie about this, no one in our family knows at all.
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.13
I'm very nervous/scared to live in Florida, seeing that I lived in Connecticut all my life until September of this year when I moved to Massachusetts.
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.14
His mom is probably not going to take it too well if we decide to go to Florida, she's already pretty upset that his other 2 brother already been living in New Hampshire with their wives for sometime now, and she thought her youngest was going to stay closeby in Massachusetts.
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.16
Florida will be different if we go...
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.17
It's looking pretty positive of going.
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.18
We just got to finish paying off his debt, and go from there...
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.19
I pray that the Lord will guide us in the right direction.
web1-eng-DF-241-201525-3255639_0003.20
If we were to go to Florida I pray the Lord directs us to a good church.

The "punishment" of Fayhan al Ghamdi for viciously beating, raping and burning his innocent 5 year old daughter who this sick and twisted man suspected of not being a virgin...
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.2
a fifty thousand dollar fine and time served...
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.3
is an offense to God and every decent human being alike.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.4
It is also an extreme hypocrisy that in Saudi Arabia, a man cannot be executed for killing his children or wife, but can face the death penalty for leaving Islam and becoming a Christian (or a member of any other religion).
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.5
The World Muslim Congress came out with a statement decrying both the murder and the "punishment" (if it can be called that).
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.6
While I do not agree with them that the Quran is God's word or that Muhammad is his prophet, everything else they said regarding the case is dead-on, in my opinion.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.7
I agree with them that capital punishment is wrong, albeit not only for the reasons they gave (which I think are good ones) but also because God clearly said in the Bible that those who do not show mercy will not be shown mercy by God.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.8
The Saudi rapist Fayhan al-Ghamdi, got away with murder
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.9
The intention of Sharia law was to serve justice to the parties in conflict, it is human interpretation of God's word to suit their era, it is not a divine law, neither is it God's law as propagated.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.10
However, it is the abuse in administering the Sharia law that is the problem.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.11
Unfortunately, the Sharia law is so distorted that it sounds like a cruel system of law to a woman who gets thrown out on the whim of an idiot by calling Talaq three times, female rape victim, an apostate and the blasphemer.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.12
Those men you have listed, "Imam Hanifa, Imam Shafi, Imam Hanbal, Imam Malik, Imam Ghazali or Imam Madoodi," were great men with a few exceptions for their time.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.13
They defined the Sharia in terms of the norms prevalent at that time.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.14
With all due respect and honor for their work, they did not have the same environment as Prophet Muhammad did or we have, - of working with different tribes and faiths, and as a result their attitudes were "stick it to them".
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.15
This man, Fayhan al-Ghamdi got away paying the blood money.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.16
He should have been locked away, as they say in Urdu "Qaid ba-mushaqqat" prison with hard labor.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.17
What prevents the SOB from repeating it?
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.18
If he has the money to shell out again, he will do it again.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.19
I n the US there are many incidents where a hard core criminal was let out on bail, and he would do go out and do the same.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.20
I am personally against the state killing the criminal deliberately, it denies the criminal from living the life, and prevents him from repenting his mistake....
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.21
and the blood money does not bring justice, compensation should be there to the victims, but that should be a part of whole punishment.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.22
We cannot trade life for money.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.23
Only God's word is beyond question, Prophet's words, if genuine, would be unquestionable.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.24
A lot has been dished out as Prophet's word.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.25
I come across so much non-sense ascribed to him.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.26
He was the ultimate peace maker and rightfully called Rahmatul Aalameen -the mercy to mankind.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.27
Muslims do not uphold that title for him; they are brutal towards those who convert from Islam to other faiths, or blasphemers.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.28
Some Muslims are very insecure in their faith, they think that Prophet will disappear into thin air if someone criticizes him, or not defended.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.29
Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is beyond defending.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.30
Some of the Imams did not have faith in the prophet and resorted to defending him, how wrong are they!
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.31
Be hopeful, things will change for better, the new generation will restore common sense to the religion which is about fairness, justness and respect for God's creation.
web1-eng-DF-241-201555-5375081_0001.32
Islam is about freedom and not compulsion.

web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.1
I know I may be stepping into a minefield here but I have to ask this.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.2
I was listening to NPR on the way to work today and one of their reporters was at a celebration that Huckabee held after winning in Iowa.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.3
The reporter was clearly next to a female who was praying in a loud, almost ranting type of way, asking God to lift up Mike Huckabee, etc etc and asking God to make sure that Huckabee is proud of being a pastor and how we are to select leaders who are spiritual, etc. I would have given anything to see a videotape of it
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.4
The press can do a remarkable job of taking even the most innocuous instance and sometimes just by broadcasting it, make it look really bad.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.5
This was one of those cases.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.6
I asked some fellow Christians about a thesis that was forming in my mind about the possibility of Huckabee being elected.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.7
I specifically asked if we, as Christians, have become so pious that we believe that the only person who can lead this country is an ordained Baptist minister.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.8
I mean, think about that for a second.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.9
The field is wide open, yet why is it that the Christians pile on Mike Huckabee's wagon and openly snub other people, like Mitt Romney?
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.10
It would be wrong of us to issue a call to Mitt Romney to be the pastor of First Baptist church.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.11
Clearly he does not share our doctrine.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.12
But does that mean that we shouldn't support him?
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.13
Or what about Giuliani?
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.14
He has been married and divorced several times.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.15
But I would remind folks that the divorce rate is the same for those of us who are "churched" and those who are unchurched.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.16
Yet it seems like we judge him on his divorces.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.17
Does anybody really believe that if Giuliani gets elected that his wife is going to divorce the powerful person in the country while he is in office?
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.18
Not a chance.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.19
Giuliani's marriage is not going to end in divorce (hopefully ever) but especially not if he gets elected.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.20
Bottom line?
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.21
There is no way that a if a republican gets elected that they will go act in a manner contrary to conservative opinions on abortion, gay marriage, etc. And by the way, there are bigger issues than those.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.22
To do so would be the death knell of the republicans.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.23
I'm not saying that I endorse any of these candidates.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.24
But I do believe that we shouldn't jump on Huckabee's wagon just because he is a pastor.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.25
So if what I said is true about what a republican president will not do, then why the support for Huckabee?
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.26
Are some of us naive?
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.27
Am I the only one who feels that he is using Jesus as a prop in the election (think of his Christmas day ad if you disagree).
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.28
I would sooner walk across hot coals than attend a Huckabee rally and rant and cheer when he speaks of values.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.29
Same thing goes for most rallies by most of today's presidential candidates.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.30
They are using us as props and we need to be resistant of that.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.31
To put it another way, if you had attended a rally for George W Bush back in 2000, would you dare tell anyone now that you were there back then?
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.32
Probably not.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.33
And for the young lady who was probably miked for her prayer, I would respectfully ask that she keep it down.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0001.34
Showboating like that, I believe, only pushes us backward in our ability to spread the Gospel and bring more people to Christ.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0002.1
Wait, what exactly is your question?
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0002.2
Are people naive?
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0002.3
Oohhhhhh yeah.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0002.4
But maybe that isn't your question.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0003.1
My question is why are people jumping on Huckabee's bandwagon.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0003.2
The rest of it was food for thought.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0004.1
Maybe they found someone they can identify with that is in the race that isn't a slick New England republican-poser politician or a beltway insider or a fringe nutjob...
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0005.1
Maybe you are right.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0005.2
My concern is the inordinate level of support he is drawing from Christian evangelicals.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0005.3
He does not have the broad support that Obama has.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0005.4
With Huck, it is very concentrated.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0006.5
It's an election, people vote for they believe is the right guy (or gal)...
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0006.6
he reflects evangelical beliefs, by and large the others are snakey, so who do ya think they're gonna vote for?
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0007.1
More politicians than not are like that.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0007.2
But they are going for him without so much as a glance at his record.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0007.3
Look at all the people he paroled while in Arkansas.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0007.4
I heard it was half the state.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0007.6
Okay, I'm kidding.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0007.7
The guy doesn't have that great of a record.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0007.8
Just because he shares our beliefs doesn't entitle him to the presidency.
web1-eng-DF-241-201689-3603165_0007.9
Separation of church and state exists for a reason and don't think for a second that if he gets in that the lines won't become dangerously blurred.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0001.1
And although I havn't finished it, I can say it is a decent book.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0001.2
Fast Paced.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0001.3
Great Plot.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0001.4
But anyone who buys the theories and "history" of this book needs to do some reading that doesn't come from the section in a Grocery store line next to the M&Ms.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0002.5
You are a crack up!
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0002.6
I haven't read it yet - we keep meaning to.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0002.7
Kinda seems important to have a bit of a feel of things hey.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0003.5
I liked it too, the writing wasn't great but it was a good read.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0003.6
I agree about the theories and history too!
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0003.7
It's straight out of "Holy blood, Holy Grail", did anyone ever read that book?
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0004.4
I havn't.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0004.5

I'm a fan of alternative histories, and this is among the oldest ones in the Christian tradition.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0005.6
To be quite truthful its been around far longer than "Holy Blood, Holy Grail."

In fact Merovich claimed to be descended from Christ according to more than one account.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0005.8
The history of it is utter hogwash (the canon wasn't even voted on at Nicea).

If we don't know the history of our faith, we are liable to believe anything someone tells about it as history.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0008.2
Fortunately, most of us probably know enough about our faith not to fall here.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0008.3
Unfortunately not every Christian Does....
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0008.4
That is what is concerning.

It's more the atheists I'm worried about...
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0010.1
Atheiests think we are all suckers, so if we look overly paranoid about some popular book or movie - it will confirm their suspicions.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0011.1
indeed so Gtsecc.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0011.2
I would add that it is important that we do read the book, and if we can't do that at least watch the movie (it really is a much better book).
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0011.3

You will probably find, like many of us that have read both books, that A&D is actually the better of the two.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0013.5
Part of the reason I am reading it.

What about his book about the digital hacking?
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0014.5
I think it was written before A&D.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0015.3

web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0017.3
Wow, I didn't see that coming.....
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0018.1
Really?
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0018.2
Okay, I'll steer clear of that one, but I'll look at A&D.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0019.1
Cola, now you see why it is sucha good book.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0019.2
I guessed it like three chapters before they told you--but still, that's aways into the book.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0019.3

While we are on the topic of suspense novels, what else do you guys like?
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0020.7
While not necessarily the same type of suspense, Jurrassic Park was awesome.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0020.8
The movie pales in comparison.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0020.9
Most movies are weak compared to the book, but this moreso.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0020.10
That brings up another topic, was the Da Vinci movie any good?
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0020.11
I haven't seen it.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0021.4
Actually, I liked "Digital Fortress".
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0021.5
I found it difficult to put down.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0021.6
I also liked "Deception point".
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0021.7
So I have read all four of his books and enjoyed them.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0021.8
Having read all four, I will admit that the only drawback to Brown's style is that his books seem to have been written on a template.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0021.9
They all follow the same format.
web1-eng-DF-241-201695-3621554_0021.10
You'll understand what I mean after you read 2 or 3 of them.

What makes a council ecumenical in the eyes of the Oriental Orthodox?
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0002.2
Bishops all over the world meet together to deal with faith and pastoral problems.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0002.3
Councils that are admitted by our church are: 1- Council of Nicea: (325 A.D.) that dealt with Arius who denied Christ's divinity.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0002.4
2- Council of Constantinople: (381 A.D.) because of Machdonius who denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0002.5
3- Council of Ephesus: (431 A.D.) because of Nestorius who separated between Christ's divinity and humanity.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0002.6
Copts had an effective role in these councils.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0002.7
also the council judgments must not conflict with the first church fathers teachings as " St. Athanasius & St. Cyril the Great "
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0003.1
Two things:
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0003.2
1. It conveys the right faith.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0003.3
2. Justly accepted by the Catholic Church, all who are of the same faith.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0003.4
(that's what seperates an "ecumenical" council from a "local" council that conveyes true faith).
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0003.5
We as OO's used to think we were the Catholic Church, but today, the fourth and fifth councils held at Ephesus (449 and 475) are not considered ecumenical, since the EO counterparts also held Orthodox faith in their last four councils (or six).
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0003.6
TECHNICALLY, we did have five "ecumenical councils," but in light of the present discussions, we agree to three: Nicea, Constantinople, and Ephesus 431.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0003.7

Two things:
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0005.3
I thought the point of an ecumenical council was to clarify essentialy there is a despute over the right faith and the council "decides" what is.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0005.4
How can this be a condition.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0006.4
Indeed, councils come about because of disputes.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0006.5
I never heard of a council convened for the sake of convening.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0006.6
But you asked how do councils become "ecumenical."
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0006.7
God bless.

Mina
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0007.6
Well yes but My point is that if the right faith is in dispute before the council and in order for the council to be ecumenical it must convey the right faith then there is no point in having an ecumenical council because after the council one side will say that it did have the right faith and the other will say that it didn't and you will be right back where you began.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0007.7
Oh and I have heard of local councils convening for the sake of convening.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0008.2
And that's why different denominations have different opinions on the numbers of ecumenical councils, and what they are.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0008.3
UNLESS, you do not believe that you are the ONLY Church, of which outside Her there is no clear path of salvation.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0008.4
In this case, any council after an "unnecessary" schism is not "accepted by the Catholic Church" (in an ecumenical sense), and thus not "ecumenical."
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0008.5
For example, in light of today's EO-OO discussions, any counci after · Ephesus 431 is not "ecumenical," but are considered no more than local councils that profess Orthodox faith.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0008.6
What did you have in mind in the "qualifications" of an ecumenical council?
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0008.9

Sorry this took so long.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0009.6
So what is an "unnecessary" schism?
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0009.7
I'd say all schism regarding a division in Truth is necessary.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0009.9
Well I mean that when a Catholic says ecumenical council they mean a council that was held in order to confront a dispute and then once it is over everyone should just except that as Truth.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0009.10
(although obviously they don't)
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0009.11
However in the Catholic Church we say it is ecumenical when the Pope says it's ecumenical.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0009.12
So I wondered what makes it ecumenical to an Orthodox person.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0009.13
I had an Idea but it didn't really make any sense to me.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0009.14
So I thought I'd come here and ask.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0009.15
But it seems we have a different Idea of an ecumenical council so I guess what to an OO person is an ecumenical council?
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0010.3
An "unnecessary" schism is a schism that occured as a result of misunderstood intentions of faith, where in actuality, both parties of the schism profess the same Truth, i.e. a schism based on semantics.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0010.6
I disagree.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0010.7
A council does not define Truth, but should uphold that which was already true before.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0010.8
If a council decreed that Arianism is correct, are we to say that Arianism, which used to be false, is all of a sudden true?
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0010.9
There would be no point in calling St. Athanasius "contra mundum," but rather "contra truth."
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0010.14
First, we have to take about Papal beliefs.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0010.15
The Pope is in no authority ALONE to say a council is ecumenical or not.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0010.16
It is a gathering of world Patriarchs together that must profess truth based on the Holy Fathers and previous faith of other councils.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0010.17
The Pope is not the Pope of the world, but only of Rome.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0010.18
He locally effects Rome and its jurisdictions, and is not above other bishops of the world.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0010.20
I think it's more than just a difference in opinion on ecumenical councils.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0010.21
We differ on Papal beliefs as well, which lead to differences in ecumenicity of councils.
web1-eng-DF-241-201698-3671034_0010.22
God bless you.

DUBUQUE, Iowa  No one doubted the Roman Catholic vote would be up for grabs in November, even before Mitt Romney named <a href="http://www.politico.com/p/pages/paul-ryan">Paul Ryan</a> as his running mate.
web1-eng-DF-261-203985-5422656_0001.5
Now, the selection of Ryan, only the second Catholic ever nominated for national office by Republicans, all but guarantees a fierce election-year fight for the affections of Catholic voters  or more specifically, whiteCatholics, who form the bulk of the Catholic vote here in this corner of Iowa and across the Rust Belt.

A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported .
nw.wsj_0003.2
The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later , researchers said .
nw.wsj_0003.3
Lorillard Inc. , the unit of New York - based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 .
nw.wsj_0003.4
Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago , the latest results appear in today 's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem .
nw.wsj_0003.5
A Lorillard spokewoman said , `` This is an old story .
nw.wsj_0003.6
We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .
nw.wsj_0003.7
There is no asbestos in our products now . ''
nw.wsj_0003.8
Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes .
nw.wsj_0003.9
`` We have no useful information on whether users are at risk , '' said James A. Talcott of Boston 's Dana - Farber Cancer Institute .
nw.wsj_0003.10
Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University .
nw.wsj_0003.11
The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in `` very modest amounts '' in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956 .
nw.wsj_0003.12
From 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said .
nw.wsj_0003.13
Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number .
nw.wsj_0003.14
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos - related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer .
nw.wsj_0003.15
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected , the researchers said .
nw.wsj_0003.16
`` The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos - related diseases , '' said Dr. Talcott .
nw.wsj_0003.17
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton , Mass. , paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries , he said .
nw.wsj_0003.18
The plant , which is owned by Hollingsworth & Vose Co. , was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters .
nw.wsj_0003.19
The finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings , Dr. Talcott said .
nw.wsj_0003.20
The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle - like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles , according to Brooke T. Mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine .
nw.wsj_0003.21
More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body , Dr. Mossman explained .
nw.wsj_0003.22
In July , the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos .
nw.wsj_0003.23
By 1997 , almost all remaining uses of cancer - causing asbestos will be outlawed .
nw.wsj_0003.24
About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s .
nw.wsj_0003.25
Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used .
nw.wsj_0003.26
Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters .
nw.wsj_0003.27
Workers described `` clouds of blue dust '' that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area .
nw.wsj_0003.28
`` There 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos - related diseases , '' said Darrell Phillips , vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose .
nw.wsj_0003.29
`` But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago .
nw.wsj_0003.30

The average seven - day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC 's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45 % from 8.47 % for the week ended Tuesday .
nw.wsj_0004.3
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year .
nw.wsj_0004.4
Average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days , the longest since early August , according to Donoghue 's .
nw.wsj_0004.5
Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period .
nw.wsj_0004.6
Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner .
nw.wsj_0004.7
The average maturity for funds open only to institutions , considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely , reached a high point for the year -- 33 days .
nw.wsj_0004.8
Nevertheless , said Brenda Malizia Negus , editor of Money Fund Report , yields `` may blip up again before they blip down '' because of recent rises in short - term interest rates .
nw.wsj_0004.9
The yield on six - month Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction , for example , rose to 8.04 % from 7.90 % .
nw.wsj_0004.10
Despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds .
nw.wsj_0004.11
Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $ 1.5 billion during the latest week , to $ 352.7 billion .
nw.wsj_0004.12
Typically , money - fund yields beat comparable short - term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates .
nw.wsj_0004.13
The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9 % .
nw.wsj_0004.14
Dreyfus World - Wide Dollar , the top - yielding fund , had a seven - day compound yield of 9.37 % during the latest week , down from 9.45 % a week earlier .
nw.wsj_0004.15
It invests heavily in dollar - denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees , which boosts its yield .
nw.wsj_0004.16
The average seven - day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12 % , down from 8.14 % .
nw.wsj_0004.17
The 30 - day simple yield fell to an average 8.19 % from 8.22 % ; the 30 - day compound yield slid to an average 8.53 % from 8.56 % .

It employs 2,700 people and has annual revenue of about $ 370 million .

The federal government suspended sales of U.S. savings bonds because Congress has n't lifted the ceiling on government debt .
nw.wsj_0008.2
Until Congress acts , the government has n't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind , the Treasury said .
nw.wsj_0008.3
The government 's borrowing authority dropped at midnight Tuesday to $ 2.80 trillion from $ 2.87 trillion .
nw.wsj_0008.4
Legislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital - gains taxes .
nw.wsj_0008.5
The House has voted to raise the ceiling to $ 3.1 trillion , but the Senate is n't expected to act until next week at the earliest .
nw.wsj_0008.6
The Treasury said the U.S. will default on Nov. 9 if Congress does n't act by then .

When it 's time for their biannual powwow , the nation 's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like Boca Raton and Hot Springs .

The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting .
nw.wsj_0010.4
And the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners .
nw.wsj_0010.5
The idea , of course : to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt is n't so rusty after all , that it 's a good place for a company to expand .

On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag , along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory .
nw.wsj_0010.7
For starters , the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist - comedian Victor Borge .
nw.wsj_0010.8
Champagne and dessert followed .

The next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway , unimpeded by traffic or red lights .

The governor could n't make it , so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests .
nw.wsj_0010.11
A buffet breakfast was held in the museum , where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors .
nw.wsj_0010.12
Then , in the guests ' honor , the speedway hauled out four drivers , crews and even the official Indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10 - lap exhibition race .
nw.wsj_0010.13
After the race , Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers .

No dummies , the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor 's name or two .

South Korea registered a trade deficit of $ 101 million in October , reflecting the country 's economic sluggishness , according to government figures released Wednesday .
nw.wsj_0011.2
Preliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October , the fifth monthly setback this year , casting a cloud on South Korea 's export - oriented economy .
nw.wsj_0011.3
Exports in October stood at $ 5.29 billion , a mere 0.7 % increase from a year earlier , while imports increased sharply to $ 5.39 billion , up 20 % from last October .
nw.wsj_0011.4
South Korea 's economic boom , which began in 1986 , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports .
nw.wsj_0011.5
Government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion .
nw.wsj_0011.6
Despite the gloomy forecast , South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $ 71 million so far this year .
nw.wsj_0011.7
From January to October , the nation 's accumulated exports increased 4 % from the same period last year to $ 50.45 billion .

The new ad plan from Newsweek , a unit of the Washington Post Co. , is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years .
nw.wsj_0012.3
Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek , Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , and Mortimer B. Zuckerman 's U.S. News & World Report .

Route 288 , the circumferential highway running around the south - western quadrant of the Richmond New Urban Region , opened in late 2004 .
wb.eng_0003.5
Already it is changing development patterns for the worse and causing localized traffic congestion around its exits .
wb.eng_0003.6
The Richmond Times - Dispatch tells the tale today about the impact on the Huguenot Trail in Powhatan County .
wb.eng_0003.7
Traffic has more than doubled in one section of Huguenot Trail since 288 opened , reports Will Jones .
wb.eng_0003.8
Speeding and accidents have surged as well :
wb.eng_0003.9
17 accidents have been reported near the intersection of Winterfield Road so far this year , up from 12 for all of 2004 .
wb.eng_0003.10
Dale Totten , resident engineer for the Virginia Department of Transportation , noted that VDOT would four - lane the road for about $ 13 million if it had more money .
wb.eng_0003.11
Of course , VDOT has no more money for road construction in the Richmond region .
wb.eng_0003.12
One reason is that VDOT , at the behest of local politicians and boosters , spent all its friggin' money on 288 !
wb.eng_0003.13
Where 's Homer Simpson when you need him ?
wb.eng_0003.14
This is a major `` D'oh! '' moment .
wb.eng_0003.15
As we predicted , Route 288 is generating residential development in scarcely populated areas all around its exits , overtaxing the local country roads .
wb.eng_0003.16
While the limited access highway might provide limited traffic relief for people driving back and forth between Chesterfield and Goochland counties , other people are making choices about where they live and work ,
wb.eng_0003.17
and they are creating traffic congestion in new places .
wb.eng_0003.18
The only thing that surprises me is how rapidly this is happening .
wb.eng_0003.19
Even I thought there might be a lag of three or four years .
wb.eng_0003.20
If Route 288 has already created a $ 13 million road - construction in just this one exist , think of the liability it has created for all of its exits !
wb.eng_0003.21
Here 's another prodiction :
wb.eng_0003.22
After a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of mega-commercial projects at major 288 intersections , the need for new road improvements will soar .
wb.eng_0003.23
Before the end of the decade , we may well see the unfunded liability zoom well past the original $ 400 million it took to build the original highway .
wb.eng_0003.24
To the brainiacs who thought Route 288 was such a great idea :
wb.eng_0003.25
Thanks for nothing .
wb.eng_0003.26
I think we could have spent the $ 400 million better elsewhere .
wb.eng_0003.27
I do n't think you can blame 288 for creating those people .
wb.eng_0003.28
If there enough of them to create new traffic congestion in new places , then what is the alternative ?
wb.eng_0003.29
Additional traffic congestion in old places ?

Now you understand how people like TMT in Fairfax feel .
wb.eng_0003.31
I 'd usually take the pro-road position -
wb.eng_0003.32
but with the glaring needs in other parts of the state , 288 was definitely excess ...
wb.eng_0003.33
You have a city , Richmond , that has virtually no traffic .
wb.eng_0003.34
The rush hour is 30 minutes long ...
wb.eng_0003.35

wb.eng_0003.42
If you get out ahead of the need you are accused of causing sprawl .

TMT : I do n't understand your point .
wb.eng_0003.56
when was the last time you were stuck in traffic that you were n't on your way to or from some sort of business ?
wb.eng_0003.57
It seems to me that the whole point of roads is to facilitate the public interest in getting to and from private businesses .
wb.eng_0003.58
Then , of course there is the sunday drive , the trip to grandma 's , and the soccer games , but still , the overwhelming need is to support business .
wb.eng_0003.59
Since our road expenditures nowhere near match the increase in business or state domestic product , it is no wonder we suffer congestion problems .
wb.eng_0003.60
If we recognize that roads primaarily benefit businesses then we should do two things :
wb.eng_0003.61
let business pay for more of our transportation bill , ( which they will pass to us , of course ) and incentivize them to locate where they put the least stress on the system , even if that means more overall travel .
wb.eng_0003.62
Why is it so hard to understand ?
wb.eng_0003.63
The solution is functional human settlement patterns and a balance between transport system capacity and land use generated travel deman .

All else is spin .

TMT said `` In Virginia , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest . ''

I think they are so tightly intertwined that they are virtually one and the same .
wb.eng_0003.69
Obviously there are local problems because this cookie dough is lumpy ,
wb.eng_0003.70
but in the aggregate if we demonize business long enough we will eventually find out we all work for the Devil .

I do n't see there is any point in claiming as `` a solution '' a balance that is dynamic and ever changing in nature .
wb.eng_0003.72
Even you see rail to Dulles as a positive because Dulles is a job center that promotes bi-directional demand on the rail .
wb.eng_0003.73
I agree .
wb.eng_0003.74
In fact that may be sufficient reason to build it , all by itself .
wb.eng_0003.75
All I 'm saying is that the exact same logic should apply to roads :
wb.eng_0003.76
they should have destinations at both ends in order that we get maximum use out of our investment :
wb.eng_0003.77
we need more places in order to get closer to the balance you say we need .

It 's a 55 mph zone - 75 to 100 cars in `` a morning '' - over how much time ?
wb.eng_0003.83
The Huguenot Trail road widening was already planned , due to the heavy demands of development on the Chesterfield side , the new schools , and a whole bunch of existing developments that were zoned years ago and at that time funneled through Robious Road .
wb.eng_0003.84
288 , for those of us that actually use it , is wonderful - instead of Powhatan and Western Chesterfield being bottlenecked by lack of roads ,
wb.eng_0003.85
we can actually get some commercial development and have the ability to work closer to where we live .

The Nashville Flood In The Words Of Someone Who Lived Through It
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.2
One of my friends is an insurance adjuster in Nashville.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.3
She's seen all the damage that took place a couple of weeks ago in Nashville and here in Clarksville it's the same only in a smaller scale.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.4
The press damn near ignored what happened here.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.5
And so did Obama.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.6
Not much help is getting here and now everyone is bonding together....saying "Fuck you Mr. President...we don't need your GD help!!!"
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.7
I was given permission to post these private emails from my friend.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.8
I hope they give you an idea of the magnitude of the damage and what little FEMA has done so far.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.9
I talked to my neighbors Saturday, they are on vacation in Germany and they had NO IDEA how bad it was because of the lack of media attention.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.10
When I started going into detail, she stopped me and said, she just couldn't comprehend it.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.11
I told her, "I know!
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.12
This is what we've been dealing with, but the people outside of Tennessee don't have a clue"
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.13
It's just hard…..I've cried with customers and talked with them, and listened to their stories.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.14
Our State Farm adjusters are trying to find ways to pay these claims, but
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.15
It's just not happening.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.16
I had one adjuster call me yesterday, at the point of tears because he had to tell one of our customers, who just lost her husband in February, that she didn't have any coverage.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.17
We're also hearing the stories about these water mitigation companies charging outlandish prices for their services.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.18
We depend on these companies, and for them to do that, is ridiculous.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.19
It's just a sad situation all around.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.20
These days seem like they go on forever.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.21
I know that I am so tired, but I cannot imagine how tired and exhausted the people that have lost their homes, cars, loved ones are.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.22
They don't have the comfort of "their bed" to go to for rest.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.23
They don't have the familiar surroundings of the homes that they have created.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.24
They are sorting through the sludge and the mud to recover any part of their former life.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.25
The life that they had less than 2 weeks ago.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.26
My heart breaks for these people.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.27
We keep hearing the stories from all over, about how out of state relatives are unconcerned because they don't know what the devastation was in our area.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.28
Our people aren't sitting on roof tops screaming for help, so they aren't on the news.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.29
Our people are out helping themselves and others in need.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.30
If the world only knew what was going on here…..it might make the rest of the world a better place.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.31
I haven't been able to get out and volunteer, but at least I ordered 2 of the WE ARE NASHVILLE t-shirts.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.32
I plan to wear it as soon as it comes in.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.33
I know that money is going into the fund to help out.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.34
Sorry, I went on and on…..but I learned a lot of that from you
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.35

I think in all the flood got about 15 minutes of nation wide coverage.

Its all about the squeaky wheel.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.110
There are no political motives to show the floods in Nashville.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.111
There aren't people there trying to up their stakes in life by boohooing their poor existence and condition in life
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.112
True.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.113
This flood was almost as bad as New Orleans....but all we get it silence.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.114
I hope your and yours are alright.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.115
I do have a question though.
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.116
As seen in NO, did you all have the looting or was it a bit more civilized?
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.117
Are you all having a mass exodus or are you all trying to do your best and clean up?
ENG_DF_000170_20100514_C000209GX_0001.118
I am curious as its been widely spread that behavior as you saw in NO is "how things are done" so to speak.

Now Gas Shortage?
ENG_DF_000170_20110809_C000203J0_0001.3
I want to share my knowledge with all that how is possible regarding Gas shortage is going to become yet another weapon to destroy this city ( Karachi ).
ENG_DF_000170_20110809_C000203J0_0001.4
Perhaps Gas shortage designed to destroy the economic and livelihood.
ENG_DF_000170_20110809_C000203J0_0001.5
Working as anti elements to destroy our country economy.
ENG_DF_000170_20110809_C000203J0_0001.6
One can't steal GAS that reasons shortage is not possible but ELECTRICITY is commonly stealing by consumers by Ill-legal connection ( khunda Connections ) in this regard KESC higher management always remain silent and never interested to catch those who are using ill-legal connection making Millions Rupees of revenue losses on return their black sheep staff get some benefits but on other hand KESC faces huge losses.
ENG_DF_000170_20110809_C000203J0_0001.7
In short our country Pakistan have full of resources and blessing from God but still after 63 years we always look ahead to WB ( World Bank ) IMF or USA or Europe Countries to get grant or aid, but never sincere or interested to use own country people talent but hiring foreign consultant and paying their desire fees which totally axing our country economy.

Just wonder if this is going to be one of those years where tornado outbreaks approach record levels.

We usually don't get tornado watches until later in March also.
ENG_DF_000170_20120302_C000205QT_0001.46
It is early to get these type of storms but I am not sure it is indicative of global warming or a precursor to a record year of tornadoes.

We're about 40 miles sw of Atlanta.

So far, almost thiry people confirmed dead.

One of two water treatment plants off line.

This was 1 mile from where my parents live and where I spent half my childhood.
ENG_DF_000203_20120415_C0001ONSN_0001.4
Some houses, farm buildings, and sheds are gone my my parents' street.

Their house was untouched; thank God.
ENG_DF_000203_20120415_C0001ONSN_0001.6
They are still without power as far as I know (19 hours).

Parts of the hospital are brand new - still under construction, really.
ENG_DF_000203_20120415_C0001ONSN_0001.10
The roof was blown off or damaged, I'm not sure, so there is flooding in the building, which was causing electrical issues.

No reported major injuries or deaths.
ENG_DF_000203_20120415_C0001ONSN_0001.13
There is an assisted living apartment complex, nursing home, and hospice house right by the hospital as well.

5.4 magnitude quake near LA a drill for the 'Big One'

LOS ANGELES — Despite shaking a large swath of Southern California, a magnitude-5.4 earthquake was not the "Big One" that scientists have long feared.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.10
Its been 21 years since a 'quake approaching this size has hit the LA area.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.12
Always a good idea to prepare for a natural disaster.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.13
In Colorado where I live its a good idea to have a survival kit in your car in case a blizzard forces you to spend the night on the side of the road.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.14
In Alaska we used to have tsunami warnings every time there was a sizeable earthquake out in the Pacific.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.15
One warning was considered serious enough that they advised the ships to leave the harbor and head for deep water.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.16
As for the residents of the town we headed up the hills My mom took us up 7th avenue to the LDS Church parking lot which is about 800 ft above sea level.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.17
We probably would have been fine staying in our own house because they recorded only a two-inch rise in sea level from average.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.18
BUT as with many things its probably 'better safe than sorry'.

ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.21
Still, it rattled nerves, causing people to vow to step up their emergency preparations.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.23
And it wasn't that big a 'quake at all.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.24
21 years?
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.26
Doubtful.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.27
And "the big one" - I laugh every time I see that phrase.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.28
21 years?
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.29
Since a 5.4??
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.30
Doubtful...
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.31
Exactly.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.33
As strongly as it was felt, Tuesday's quake was far less powerful than the deadly magnitude-6.7 Northridge earthquake that toppled bridges and buildings in 1994.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.34
That was the last damaging temblor in Southern California, though not the biggest.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.35
A 7.1 quake struck the desert in 1999.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.36
Exactly.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.37
I don't know what they're calling "in the area", but the Northridge quake was only 40 miles away from Chino Hills.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.38
The recent quake was a nothing.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.39
Cause for going to the internet to see how big and how close, nothing more.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.40
One person in the office happened to be driving and was not sure if it was a quake or the big truck next to her.
ENG_DF_000241_20080730_C0001N5XN_0001.41

ENG_DF_000288_20110110_C0001ODGI_0001.16
Those two creeks that run though that town and meet near the CBD are normally dry I think, and are little more than large gutters really in places.
ENG_DF_000288_20110110_C0001ODGI_0001.17
No way could they hold that kind of water.
ENG_DF_000288_20110110_C0001ODGI_0001.18
Some of the pics taken from a highrise in the Toowoomba CBD show that one of those creeks was at least a quarter mile wide in the middle of the CBD.

The priorities for assistance continue to be food and shelter.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST1_0001.8
The Government and the Shelter Cluster have adopted a strategy to provide emergency and transitional shelter to the highest number of those in need before the start of the rainy season.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST1_0001.9
This will include distribution of a range of shelter material, including tents, plastic sheeting, fastening fixtures and rope.

According to WHO/PAHO, medical teams are reporting a shift in the types of cases they are receiving.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST1_0001.12
There is a decrease in trauma cases and an increase in mental health needs.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST1_0001.13
Several medical teams report a growing caseload of diarrhea in the last few days.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST1_0001.14
There have been reports of tetanus, but previously reported cases of the measles were confirmed as chicken pox.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST1_0001.15
WHO is working to overcome challenges related to the cold chain and the distribution of vaccines for targeted vaccination campaigns where there are high concentrations of people in resettlement areas.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST1_0001.16
As of 28 January, the Government reported that more than 341,000 persons have departed Port-au-Prince for locations outside the capital.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST1_0001.17
This represents an increase of approximately 80,000 people from the previously reported figure of 260,000 as of 27 January, but this may largely be based on better reporting rather than new movements.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST1_0001.18
Over a third of the total – some 133,000 individuals – have arrived in Ar tibonite department.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST1_0001.19

Following light repairs to Port-au-Prince’s south port, an in-depth assessment has found more serious damage.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST2_0001.8
The port has been declared unsafe for incoming ships, so landing crafts are being used to offload them, but with very limited capacity and these should be coordinated in advance.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST2_0001.9
Ships are being diverted to intermediate holding.

ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST2_0001.12
A proposal is underway to allocate 50 percent of flights to humanitarian cargo and 50 percent to bilateral flights and flights supporting the Government of Haiti.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST2_0001.13
A bottleneck is being caused by goods arriving without clear consignees, addresses and packing lists.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST2_0001.14
There is also an issue of prioritized flights not being cancelled in time, resulting in disruptive ‘no-shows’.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST2_0001.15
The cluster reports that 50 trucks are available in Haiti including M6 and long-haul vehicles for inter-agency cargo transport.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST2_0001.16
While the cluster can still assist with urgent requests for fuel on an ad hoc basis, fuel is now available in town and organizations should have no problem securing supplies.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST2_0001.17
UNHAS has so far transported passengers from 86 organizations, including UN agencies, NGOs, governments and media institutions from Santo Domingo to Port-au-Prince.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST2_0001.18

So far, 6,080 tarpaulins, 1,948 tents, 400 shelter boxes (includes tents), 800 shelter kits and 3,345 plastic sheets have been distributed by cluster partners.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST3_0001.8
Agencies participating in the distribution include Acted, ARC, ARC relief, AVSI, Catholic Relief services, IOM, Islamic Relief and the Red Cross Movement.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST3_0001.9
In addition, current stock/pipeline information accounts for 66,610 tarpaulins, 47,284 tents, 100 shelter boxes and 44,852 plastic sheets.

Tent distributions to several existing makeshift settlement sites such as Champs de Mars, Place Boyer and Place Saint Pierre are not feasible due to the high density of the population in these areas.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST3_0001.11
Shelter needs will have to be covered exclusively through the provision of plastic sheeting.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST3_0001.12
An initial mapping of ‘who is doing what where’ has been carried out in order to establish a distribution plan.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST3_0001.13
The cluster is populating an NFI Tracking Matrix to compile stock, pipeline and distribution information from partners.

Three planned settlements have been finalized for sites in Parc St Claire in Delmas 33, Parc Colofaire in Delmas 33, and Tabarre 48 Carradeux Street.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST4_0001.8
The Civil Protection Department also began to set up 230 family tents at a site located in front of the airport.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST4_0001.9
The site at Tabarre is almost complete and the first families are expected to arrive in the coming says.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST4_0001.10
It will accommodate over 3,000 people.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST4_0001.11
According to IOM, partners are setting up 350 ten-person tents, as well as finalizing work on latrines, showers, and electricity for the settlement.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST4_0001.12
The main constraint for efficient site planning remains insufficient sharing of information between partners.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST4_0001.13
The Civil Protection Department will launch a radio campaign to request community leaders to provide data on displacement of populations in their communities.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST4_0001.14
This information will allow CCCM partners to identify focal points to manage camps and shelter sites.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST4_0001.15

A total of 585,733 people have been reached with food by WFP and its partners since the start of the response.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST5_0001.8
This is an increase of 127,000 people over the past two days.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST5_0001.9
Despite significant logistical challenges, WFP food distributions continue to reach the most severely affected people.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST5_0001.10
WFP has been channeling food support through orphanages and hospitals in order to target some of the most vulnerable groups.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST5_0001.11
WFP plans to increase coverage to include an additional 370 orphanages, in partnership with UNICEF.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST5_0001.12
WFP is also extending its emergency operation for an additional six months in order to continue to assist vulnerable Haitians and to support essential rehabilitation and stabilization measures.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST5_0001.13
In the longer term, a gradual transition from general food distributions to food- and cash-for-work activities is planned, as relief gives way to recovery.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST5_0001.14
A large number of bilateral partners and NGOs are also providing food assistance.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST5_0001.15
A centralized tracking needs to be established to avoid double counting reported deliveries.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST5_0001.16
In order to gain a full picture of food assistance and to accurately reflect all efforts, partners are encouraged to report their activities to the food cluster coordinator.

The suspected cases of measles were later confirmed as chicken pox.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST6_0001.9
The risk of a measles outbreak will depend upon the reintroduction of the measles virus into the population.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST6_0001.10
PAHO/WHO is insisting that all aid workers going to Haiti should be vaccinated against both measles and rubella to prevent anyone from bringing measles or rubella into the country.

UNICEF estimates that 50,000 non-breastfed infants need nutritional support.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST8_0001.10
There is currently capacity to reach out to 1,200 of them.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST8_0001.11
The main constraint is the lack of partners.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST8_0001.12
Because of the high numbers of orphans and mothers who are not able to breastfeed, there is a need for infant formula, but it should be provided in a controlled way.
ENG_NA_020001_20161020_G0023FST8_0001.13
A sub-cluster has been activated in Port-au-Prince to oversee all aspects of infant feeding and to ensure coordination.

Doctors struggle to save Rwanda's children by Luke Odhiambo
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.2
NAIROBI, May 25 (AFP)
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.3
Doctors and relief workers in Kigali are toiling day and night against overwhelming odds to save the lives of children and women encamped in squalid settlements dotted around Rwanda's blood-drenched capital.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.4
"There are four Red Cross doctors in Kigali and a Ghanaian army doctor with the UN who is performing 300 operations a day on the wounded," Roger Carter of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said Wednesday.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.5
Carter told reporters on his return from Kigali that the capture of Kigali airport and a nearby army base by rebels Sunday had hindered food distribution to about 12,500 desperate and hungry displaced people in 11 makeshift camps.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.6
Relief workers can no longer cross the front line from rebel-held areas to government territory for fear of getting caught in crossfire, and can now reach only about 3,000 people, he said.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.7
"The government has switched off water supplies to areas not under their control and that's made conditions even worse," Carter said.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.8
He said 45 percent of Kigali's displaced people were children and 35 percent women.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.9
Most have been wounded by shrapnel during artillery duels between the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and the army.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.10
About 1,500 people, mostly Hutus, are cowering in a hangar at the airport, fearing reprisals by the mainly Tutsi rebels for the slaughter of Tutsis by Hutu militias.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.11
But the reprisals have not come, Carter said.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.12
Up to half a million Rwandans, mostly minority Tutsis and Hutu opposition supporters, have been hacked, clubbed, burned or shot to death since the April 6 death of president Juvenal Habyarimana in a suspected rocket attack on his plane unleashed frenzied ethnic slaughter.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.13
Thousands of Hutus are fleeing Kigali before an expected rebel takeover which they fear will usher in retaliation for the deaths of up to half a million people, mostly Tutsis and Hutu opposition supporters, in a six-week bloodbath, relief officials said.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.14
"There is a general food shortage in Kigali, as currently UNICEF is using only one C-130 aircraft to bring in supplies," Carter said.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.15
He said he was hoping more aircraft would be made available, but all relief flights were suspended Wednesday after a bullet hole was found in a UN plane on its return to Nairobi from Kigali, UN officials said.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.16
"There is going to be serious malnutrition in the city in the next 10 to 12 days," Carter said.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.17
It has already been 10 days since UNICEF last distributed food to the displaced people's camps, he added.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.18
Carter estimated that 50,000 to 70,000 civilians remained in Kigali with another 200,000 in surrounding areas.
ENG_NW_000050_19940525_B000003DZ_0001.19
UNICEF plans to start vaccinating children in the rebel-held north on Thursday to prevent the spread of epidemics, Carter said.

Death toll in Chinese factory collapse rises to five
ENG_NW_000050_19940605_B0000068N_0001.2
BEIJING, June 5 (AFP)
ENG_NW_000050_19940605_B0000068N_0001.3
The death toll from the collapse of an illegally built factory in southern China has risen to five, as three more bodies were pulled out of the rubble, a local official said Sunday.
ENG_NW_000050_19940605_B0000068N_0001.4
The official said by telephone that 63 people remained in hospital after the collapse early Saturday morning of the dormitory at the Hong Kong-owned Hip Shing Plastic Toy Factory near the Shenzhen economic zone.
ENG_NW_000050_19940605_B0000068N_0001.5
But the official was unable to give details of their condition.
ENG_NW_000050_19940605_B0000068N_0001.6
China's official news agency, Xinhua, said Saturday that nine of the 63 people injured were in serious condition.
ENG_NW_000050_19940605_B0000068N_0001.7
The official denied reports that about 130 people may still be trapped in the rubble of the multi-storey dormitory, saying that between 60 to 70 had been in the building at the time of its collapse.
ENG_NW_000050_19940605_B0000068N_0001.8
Hong Kong newspapers Sunday quoted local workers as saying that the building housed about 200 workers from the factory, in Longgang, about 20 kilometres (12.5 miles) northeast of Shenzhen.
ENG_NW_000050_19940605_B0000068N_0001.9
One official said Saturday the workers were mostly women from the countryside, who had been sleeping when the building collapsed at 7:30 a.m. (2330 GMT).
ENG_NW_000050_19940605_B0000068N_0001.10
The Hong Kong owner of the factory, Wong Cheng-ying, "is helping with the investigations," another Shenzhen official said Sunday, declining to give further details.
ENG_NW_000050_19940605_B0000068N_0001.11
The first official said that according to initial investigations, "the cause of the accident was shoddy work and use of poor material in the illegal construction of the building."
ENG_NW_000050_19940605_B0000068N_0001.12
Officials said that three of the building's four stories had already been completed, while the top floor was still under construction.
ENG_NW_000050_19940605_B0000068N_0001.13
They said rescue operations were continuing, with as many as 1,600 people involved in digging through the rubble.

Death toll hits 253 in Colombia landslides
ENG_NW_000050_19940608_B000007EH_0001.2
BOGOTA, June 8 (AFP)
ENG_NW_000050_19940608_B000007EH_0001.3
The death toll rose to 253 in a series of mudslides in southwestern Colombia triggered by an earthquake earlier this week, the Office of Disaster Prevention and Relief said Wednesday.
ENG_NW_000050_19940608_B000007EH_0001.4
Officials said 116 persons were injured, 71 mission and some 3,000 homeless in a casualty toll still incomplete.
ENG_NW_000050_19940608_B000007EH_0001.5
Rain, fog and muddy ground hampered rescue workers Wednesday, as thousands were forced to spend a second night outside.
ENG_NW_000050_19940608_B000007EH_0001.6
The torrents of mud, rock and debris that tore down the Nevado del Huila volcano cut roads and downed bridges to make land access impossible to the four destroyed villages and three hard hit hamlets.
ENG_NW_000050_19940608_B000007EH_0001.7
The weather conditions, combined with difficulty in telling mud from solid ground, hampered army helicopters traveling back and forth to affected areas to land.
ENG_NW_000050_19940608_B000007EH_0001.8
But officials said 100 survivors were airlifted out late Wednesday.
ENG_NW_000050_19940608_B000007EH_0001.9
"The area is completely destroyed.
ENG_NW_000050_19940608_B000007EH_0001.10
The bridges, the roads, the homes are destroyed.
ENG_NW_000050_19940608_B000007EH_0001.11
Entire villages are gone," said President Cesar Gaviria in a trembling voice in the provincial capital Neiva.
ENG_NW_000050_19940608_B000007EH_0001.12
The Colombian president urged international assistance for the victims of an earthquake that measured 6.0 on the open-ended Richter scale and shook loose tons of mud, boulders and debris that engulfed Toez, Irlanda and at least five other Andean towns.
ENG_NW_000050_19940608_B000007EH_0001.13
More than 800 aftershocks have been recorded since the quake, including several strong temblors Wednesday.
ENG_NW_000050_19940608_B000007EH_0001.14
In a radio message, Gaviria told villagers that rescue workers would begin building temporary camps soon to house those who lost their homes to the Paez River.
ENG_NW_000050_19940608_B000007EH_0001.15
The US Geological Survey said Monday's temblor was the strongest in Colombia since a May 24, 1957 earthquake that measured 6.8 on the open-ended Richer scale.

New outbreak of disease feared among Rwandan refugees by Michel Cariou
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.2
GOMA, Zaire, Sept 9 (AFP)
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.3
Relief officials Friday said they fear new and fatal epidemics will spread among Rwandan refugees with the arrival of the rainy season, as the World Health Organization appealed for further international aid.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.4
Relief officials in Goma said although the mortality rate in Rwandan refugee camps has stabilized following a ruthless cholera epidemic, there were fears of an outbreak of malaria and pneumonia with the rainy season now beginning.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.5
A series of rain storms have already hit the region leaving the refugees soaked and vulnerable to illness.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.6
The rainy season in the region, which typically begins in mid- September and lasts for about a month, brings with it an outbreak of pneumonia, bronchitis and malaria every year.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.7
Relief officials said they have already detected an increase in the number of malaria cases since the end of August, several of them of the fatal cerebral malaria type
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.8
They said many of the refugees, their bodies weakened by their harrowing experience of fleeing Rwanda and the poor conditions in the camps, have neither the strength nor the natural immunity to survive malaria.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.9
Rwanda is located at high altitude and the virus cannot survive beyond 1,700 meters (5,600 feet), meaning that Rwandans coming to lower lying Zaire are unused to the malaria disease.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.10
But despite the warnings, relief officials said they are much better set up to face a disease outbreak than they were at the beginning of the refugee exodus in April.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.11
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said the mortality rate among the 800,000 refugees housed in three camps in the Goma region was now about 300 a day.

"For us to be able to say that the situation is under control, we need to go down to a daily death rate of one out of 10,000," said Claire Bourgeois, a UNHCR medical coordinator in Goma.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.13
She added that the situation was much improved from July when between 30 and 40 refugees out of 10,000 were dying daily.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.14
She said about 60 non-governmental organizations were currenlty operating in Zaire, in addition to UN bodies.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.15
"All the programs are not yet set up but the medical means are satisfactory," Bourgeois said.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.16
"Whatever happens it can't be worse than the cholera epidemic which was unusually brutal."
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.17
The World Health Organization, meanwhile, appealed for international aid to provide sanitary assistance to Rwanda's neighbors who were overwhelmed by the two million refugees that fled inter-ethnic flighting in Rwanda last April.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.18
The world body, currently holding its annual Regional Committee for Africa summit in Brazzaville, also pledged to restore Rwanda's shattered sanitary system, an official for the group said.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.19
"The international community must mobilize in order to help Rwanda restore its health system to alleviate the suffering of the population and encourage the return of refugees," the official said.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.20
He added that the organisation the summit also denounced African countries for providing little humanitarian assistance to Rwanda.
ENG_NW_000050_19940909_B00000X8M_0001.21
He said Gabon and Zambia are the only African nations to have provided food and relief aid.

Plague spreads in western Indian state
ENG_NW_000050_19940920_B0000105E_0001.2
NEW DELHI, Sept 20 (AFP)
ENG_NW_000050_19940920_B0000105E_0001.3
An outbreak of bubonic plague has spread in the western Indian state of Maharashtra with the number of victims rising to 64, newspapers said Tuesday.
ENG_NW_000050_19940920_B0000105E_0001.4
Twenty-eight more cases of the rodent-borne disease have been detected over the past few days in the districts of Latur and Beed, experts from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) were quoted as saying by dailies.
ENG_NW_000050_19940920_B0000105E_0001.5
The disease, which has been virtually eradicated from the face of the earth, has claimed one life, according to press reports.
ENG_NW_000050_19940920_B0000105E_0001.6
The outbreak of plague has occurred in two districts of Maharashtra state hit by a devastating earthquake a year ago.
ENG_NW_000050_19940920_B0000105E_0001.7
The September 30 quake left some 10,000 people dead and about 200,000 people homeless.
ENG_NW_000050_19940920_B0000105E_0001.8
Health authorities have launched a house-to-house survey to collect blood samples and the government has been trying to reassure jittery residents.
ENG_NW_000050_19940920_B0000105E_0001.9
A government source said the epidemic had been caused by a sharp rise in the rat population in the area caused by the conversion of damaged homes into granaries.
ENG_NW_000050_19940920_B0000105E_0001.10
The outbreak of plague in India, the first in 18 years, is seen by critics as an indicator of declining health services in villages.
ENG_NW_000050_19940920_B0000105E_0001.11
"First it was malaria, then cholera and now it is plague.
ENG_NW_000050_19940920_B0000105E_0001.12
Isn't this a clear indication that our primary health services are breaking down," Mira Shiva, Director of the Voluntary Health Association of India told The Pioneer.
ENG_NW_000050_19940920_B0000105E_0001.13
"Why does the government act after the onslaught of an epidemic.
ENG_NW_000050_19940920_B0000105E_0001.14
Why aren't they ashamed that in an age when we are launching satellites into space, we have yet to conquer a medieval disease like plague."

13 dead, thousands of homes buried in steaming mudflow
ENG_NW_000050_19940923_B000010YX_0001.2
SAN FERNANDO, Philippines, Sept 23 (AFP)
ENG_NW_000050_19940923_B000010YX_0001.3
A steaming three-meter (10-foot) deep river of volcanic mud swept through two towns north of Manila, killing 13 people, injuring five and burying thousands of homes, relief officials said Friday.
ENG_NW_000050_19940923_B000010YX_0001.4
Regional relief officer Lucia Gutierrez said the mudflow from Mount Pinatubo, triggered by heavy rains Thursday, killed nine residents in Bacolor town while four in Porac died when their home was buried by the mud.
ENG_NW_000050_19940923_B000010YX_0001.5
At least seven persons were reported missing when the mudflow destroyed a bridge linking three towns, stranding thousands of commuters since early Thursday, Gutierrez added.
ENG_NW_000050_19940923_B000010YX_0001.6
Police leading rescue operations said the five injured suffered third- degree burns from the hot mud.
ENG_NW_000050_19940923_B000010YX_0001.7
The area is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Pinatubo, which erupted in 1991 covering vast areas with volcanic ash.
ENG_NW_000050_19940923_B000010YX_0001.8
Hot ash continues to cascade down the volcano's sides and during heavy rains turns into steaming mudflows which have buried whole towns.
ENG_NW_000050_19940923_B000010YX_0001.9
Experts estimate that these will continue until 1998.

Heatwave toll nears 500, inferno hits India's trade
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.2
NEW DELHI, June 17 (AFP)
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.3
A blistering heatwave sweeping India has left around 470 people dead and disrupted businesses in some of the country's busiest trade centres, officials said Saturday.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.4
The Press Trust of India reported 78 more deaths Saturday in Uttar Pradesh, taking the heat-related toll in the overcrowded northern state to 283.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.5
Unofficial reports said more people could have perished, since many casualties go unreported in the country's hundreds of thousands of villages.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.6
Officials said residents of Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh suffered under a hot sun with the mercury remaining constant at 48.5 degrees Celsius (119.3 Fahrenheit) for the third straight day Saturday.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.7
Health authorities in Uttar Pradesh asked people Saturday not to move out in the open and deployed additional personnel at hospitals to treat dozens of sunstroke victims.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.8
Heat deaths have occurred everywhere, in trains, offices, markets, airports and banks, prompting people to remain away from the unforgiving sun burning the country's parched Gangetic plains.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.9
Brokers from stock exchanges in New Delhi and Bombay reported low volumes of trading saying the heatwave has pushed many of their senior colleagues to take vacations.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.10
"Top brokers will return only after July 10 when the monsoon arrives," said Surjeet Kalia, a stock broker.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.11
The Bombay Stock Exchange accounts for 70 percent of all transactions in India.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.12
The New Delhi bourse, with 4,000 listed companies, is the country's second largest.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.13
Government offices have begun reporting low attendance, while private businesses said the heatwave was affecting work.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.14
Wholesale markets of perishable goods reported similar problems because of the searing heat.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.15
"By the time we take delivery of green vegetables they dry up," a New Delhi vendor said.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.16
The Indian capital, baking under a 16-day spell of unforgiving heat, suffered the year's second hottest day on Friday when temperatures soared to 45.6 degrees Celsius (114.08 Fahrenheit).
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.17
The highest toll after Uttar Pradesh occured in the desert state of Rajasthan with 76 fatalities, followed by 22 deaths in Orissa.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.18
Scores of heat-related deaths have also occurred in Bihar, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Haryana.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.19
The temperature Saturday zoomed to 45.3 degrees Celsius (113.54 Fahrenheit) in Jammu, the winter capital of Himalayan Kashmir, and weary travellers complained of the suffocating heat.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.20
Meanwhile, lashing monsoon rains in the tea-rich districts of West Bengal and in three adjoining northeastern states flooded large areas, forcing more than 200,000 people to abandon their homes, PTI said.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.21
Soldiers were deployed for relief operations in the affected districts of Coochbehar, Alipurduar and Jalpaiguri in Bengal where several houses and vast tracts of farmland were under water.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.22
In neighbouring Assam, several rivers including the Brahmaputra were in spate, affecting rail and communication links, officials said, reporting at least two cases of drowning.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.23
Flash floods in Meghalaya state, bordering Assam, washed away a 75-metre (245-foot) long bridge and several houses.
ENG_NW_000050_19950617_B00003ALB_0001.24
They also triggered landslides, officials said.

MONROVIA, April 21 (AFP)
ENG_NW_000050_19960421_B00006FFM_0001.3
Aid workers treated 2,030 people, 18 of whom died, at a military field hospital, since the outbreak of factional fighting in central Monrovia two weeks ago, according to figures released on Sunday.
ENG_NW_000050_19960421_B00006FFM_0001.4
More than 25,000 people have taken refuge in the hospital, according to the same set of figures from the Greystone clinic.
ENG_NW_000050_19960421_B00006FFM_0001.5
Of those treated between April 8 and 20, 1,032 people had bullet wounds, 576 had been injured by rocket attacks, 47 suffered from cholera, 372 from diarrhoea and three from measles.
ENG_NW_000050_19960421_B00006FFM_0001.6

Locust swarms invade Mauritania capital
ENG_NW_000050_20040804_B0000NQ4V_0001.2
NOUAKCHOTT, Aug 4 (AFP)
ENG_NW_000050_20040804_B0000NQ4V_0001.3
Swarms of the dreaded locusts on Wednesday invaded Nouakchott, darkening the skies over the northwest African capital of Mauritania before swooping down to devour everything arable in sight.
ENG_NW_000050_20040804_B0000NQ4V_0001.4
Orchards of fruit and nut trees were the preferred targets of the locusts, which have attained plague status across north and west Africa this year, spreading across 6.5 million hectares (16 million acres) of agricultural land in the Maghreb nations of north Africa and the Sahel region to the south.
ENG_NW_000050_20040804_B0000NQ4V_0001.5
The arrival of the tenacious winged insect in Nouakchott was preordained as they have already swept across the agricultural and pastoral zones in the interior of the massive country, which is larger than France and Spain combined.
ENG_NW_000050_20040804_B0000NQ4V_0001.6
Mauritania has appealed for international aid to combat the scourge.
ENG_NW_000050_20040804_B0000NQ4V_0001.7
Ministers from Algeria, Chad, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Senegal and Tunisia met last month to discuss regional efforts to deal with the locust problem, which the UN Food and Agriculture Organization has warned will destroy entire fields of maize, cassava and other staple regional crops.
ENG_NW_000050_20040804_B0000NQ4V_0001.8
One tonne of locusts -- a very small portion of an average swarm -- eat as much food in one day as 2,500 people.

But the sense of urgency for this meeting matches the rage felt by both Israelis and Palestinians after yesterday's violence.

Young Palestinians prayed outside and some young men were asked and beaten by Israeli police which may help make clear why arranging a summit is so difficult.
NW_ABC_ENG_0001_2000_1013.5
And why the political leaders will have such a hard time keeping the streets -- getting the streets calm.

On the streets of Gaza today, talk of summits and peace was the last thing many Palestinians wanted to hear.

What Israel did yesterday has turned anger here to fury.
NW_ABC_ENG_0001_2000_1013.14
It is war, Palestinians say, and Mr. Arafat has no business talking peace.
NW_ABC_ENG_0001_2000_1013.15
You want a war?
NW_ABC_ENG_0001_2000_1013.16
Yes.

Why?

I hope.
NW_ABC_ENG_0001_2000_1013.19
Why?
NW_ABC_ENG_0001_2000_1013.20
Because no peace.

After all this, no peace.

Two months after the submarine "Kursk" went down with 118 men on board, divers have managed to get inside.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.3
They found five bodies so far.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.4
And today, they found a note, written after a pair of explosions ripped through the hull and sent the "Kursk" into the depths of the Barents see.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.5
Here's ABC's bob woodruff.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.6
The note was discovered by divers inside one compartment of the submarine, on the body of 27-year-old lieutenant captain Dmitry Kolesnikov, photographed here on board the "Kursk" three years ago.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.7
"I am writing blindly," he wrote apparently in darkness.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.8
"None of us can get to the surface."
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.9
Russian officials believe the note was written at least two hours after the sub began to sink.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.10
"All the crew from the sixth, seventh and eighth compartments went over to the ninth."
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.11
Kolesnikov wrote, "There are 23 people here.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.12
We made this decision as a result of the accident."
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.13
The note contains no new evidence about what sank the "Kursk," whether it was an internal explosion or a collision.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.14
But it does contradict the official Russian version that was given to family members, that all 118 men had died instantly.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.15
Today, the chief of Russia's navy was forced to admit to the families he was wrong, that some of the crew not only survived, according to Kolesnikov's note,
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.16
Two or three tried to get out through the escape hatch.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.17
But it may have been flooded.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.18
Today, Kolesnikov's widow could not hold back her tears.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.19
"It's horribly painful, it's awful," she said.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.20
"I had a feeling that he didn't die immediately, and it turned out my feeling was right."
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.21
She also says her husband had a premonition.
NW_ABC_ENG_0002_2000_1026.22

Kids on the street now speak openly about feeling a sense of rage or wanting to strike out, a nothing-to-lose mentality with no traditional sense of shame for failure.

Jails and reform schools for young Japanese are filled to capacity.
NW_ABC_ENG_0003_2000_1128.13
ABC News was allowed a rare visit to a reform school here we were not allowed to speak with or identify the young offenders, but counselor Kenji Ohtsuru says many of these kids are loners with no self-esteem.
NW_ABC_ENG_0003_2000_1128.14
The school tries to provide the attention they never received at home or school, a mix of education, discipline and chores, with time for team sports to emphasize group responsibility.

Sociologists here say these schools are a good start, but they fear Japan's juvenile crime crisis may only be just beginning.

INNSBRUCK, Austria, April 26
NW_AFP_ENG_0005_2002_0426.3
Rescue workers were battling Friday to locate six hikers reported missing and thought to be buried in snow in the Austrian Alps, after an avalanche left another of the group dead, police said.

Fifteen people were killed and more than 30 wounded Wednesday as a suicide bomber blew himself up on a student bus in the northern town of Haifa, the first bombing in Israel in exactly two months.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.2
Several hours later, dozens of Israeli tanks advanced into the northern Gaza Strip backed by helicopters which fired at least three rockets in the Jabaliya area, Palestinian security sources said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.3
Palestinian medical sources said 60-year-old Mohammed al-Biyari was killed in his home near Jabaliya refugee camp by the rocket fire and another wounded.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.4
A second rocket landed in farmlands and the other hit a house inside the refugee camp, but without causing further casualties, Palestinian security sources said.

Two 13-year-old children were among those killed in the Haifa bus bombing, Israeli public radio said, adding that most of the victims were youngsters.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.6
The army said two soldiers were also among the dead.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.7
The bus was ripped to shreds while travelling between a residential area and Haifa university.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.8
Of the 33 injured still in hospital late Wednesday, two were in intensive care and six others in serious condition, the radio said.

Israel's night-time raid in Gaza involving around 40 tanks and armoured vehicles came after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon convened his security cabinet to discuss a response to the bomb attack.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.10
Israeli media said the retaliation was unlikely to be on a scale that would risk disrupting US preparations for war on Iraq.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.11
The Palestinian suicide bomber on the Haifa bus came from the southern West Bank town of Hebron, public radio said, naming him as 20-year-old Mahmoud Hamadan Salim Qawasmi.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.12
Apart from his ID card, also found in the wreckage were the remains of a letter allegedly outlining his plan to carry out a suicide attack and praising the September 2001 destruction of the World Trade Centre in New York, it said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.13
Israeli police were not immediately available for comment, but Palestinian sources in Hebron said Mahmoud Qawasmi was a 21-year-old student with links to the Islamic radical group Hamas.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.14
Israeli forces moved into Hebron's Al-Sheikh district where his family lived and arrested Qawasmi's brother and father after the bombing, they said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.15
Without claiming responsibility, Hamas and another hardline group, Islamic Jihad, said the blast was revenge for a string of bloody Israeli army raids into the Gaza Strip in recent weeks.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.16
But the Palestinian Authority condemned the attack, saying it would divert international sympathy away from the far higher Palestinian civilian death toll.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.17
"We condemn all attacks against civilians including today's attack in Haifa," said information minister Yasser Abed Rabbo.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.18
The Palestinian leadership said the attack would serve as "a pretext for Israel's government and occupation army to step up its deadly campaign which caused the deaths of 77 Palestinians in February".
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.19
It was the first bomb attack inside Israel since January 5, and came just days after the hawkish Sharon appointed the most right-wing government in Israel's history on a pledge to get tough on security.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.20
In the January attack, two Palestinian suicide bombers blew themselves up in central Tel Aviv, killing 23 other people.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.21
Israeli government spokesman Avi Pazner called the latest deadly blast a "very grave attack" and said the Jewish state would take "vigorous action against the terrorist organisations".
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.22
He told AFP that Israeli intelligence had been dealing with at least 40 tip-offs of impending attacks when the Haifa bus was blown up.
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.23
US President George W. Bush condemned the "attack on innocents in Israel," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, adding that "his message to the terrorists is: Their efforts will not be succcessful.

"He will continue to pursue the path to peace in the Middle East."
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.25
EU foreign policy supremo Javier Solana likewise slammed the attack, although he also took a jab at Israel, saying, "There have been too many civilians killed in the last weeks and the last days."
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.26
In London, a spokesman for the British prime minister said Tony Blair "condemns absolutely what has happened".
NW_AFP_ENG_0006_2003_0305.27
The spokesman added that he "would obviously call on all sides to do what they can to break the cycle of violence, because it is only through engagement that we can realise the vision everyone wants to see.

"There needs to be dialogue in order for this to be resolved."

The bus attack came just two days after Israeli forces staged a bloody raid into a refugee camp in central Gaza targeting a founding member of Hamas, which has spearheaded suicide bombings against the Jewish state.

Hamas vowed to continue its attacks, while the Palestinian Authority accused Israel of trying to disrupt top-level Palestinian meetings to discuss reforms of Arafat's administration.

"We have warned against the marginalisation of the United Nations ... and we see this aggression today plunging the world into a tunnel where one cannot see the end," he said in a statement.

The war in Iraq could last months and require considerable US military reinforcements to assure a victory, the Washington Post reported Thursday, quoting senior US military officials.
NW_AFP_ENG_0008_2003_0327.6
Sandstorms, dangerously long supply lines and a recalcitrant enemy "has led to a broad reassessment by some top generals of US military expectations and timelines," the Post reports.
NW_AFP_ENG_0008_2003_0327.7
"Tell me how this ends," one senior officer asked the Post.
NW_AFP_ENG_0008_2003_0327.8
Most US army commanders believe it is critical to pause the breakneck advance towards Baghdad to secure the supply lines and make sure weapons are operable and troops resupplied after days of powerful sandstorms and damage inflicted by Iraqi attacks, the Post reports.
NW_AFP_ENG_0008_2003_0327.9
The Post also quoted Central Intelligence Agency and Pentagon intelligence analysts complaining that Bush officials largely ignored their warning that Iraqi irregular forces would use guerrilla tactics and offer significant resistance.
NW_AFP_ENG_0008_2003_0327.10
Publicly US officials have insisted that the war is going according to plan, and the most advanced US forces are currently some 100 kilometers (60 miles) outside of Baghdad.

Talks were to focus on how to run a post-Saddam Iraq, with Washington resisting a large United Nations role.
NW_AFP_ENG_0008_2003_0327.15
Blair faces an uphill battle to win Bush over to giving the UN oversight of a post-Saddam administration, as Washington officials are still angry at Germany, Russia, and especially France, over the failure to secure UN Security Council approval for military action.

Bush gave a new, stronger warning that the war could become drawn out.
NW_AFP_ENG_0008_2003_0327.19
"As they approach Baghdad, our fighting units are facing the most desperate elements of a doomed regime," Bush told cheering military personnel Wednesday at the Florida headquarters of Central Command, which is running the campaign.
NW_AFP_ENG_0008_2003_0327.20
"We cannot predict the final day of the Iraqi regime, but I can assure you -- and I assure the long-suffering people of Iraq -- there will be a day of reckoning for the Iraqi regime, and that day is drawing near," he said.

At the last minute, Bush withdrew a phrase in his speech saying the campaign was "ahead of schedule."
NW_AFP_ENG_0008_2003_0327.22
A senior administration official said the president had decided to be cautious.
NW_AFP_ENG_0008_2003_0327.23
Bush pointedly paid tribute to the 48-nation "coalition of the willing" -- particularly Britain -- that is publicly backing the campaign.
NW_AFP_ENG_0008_2003_0327.24
Separately, US Secretary of State Colin Powell emphasized US determination to pursue the military campaign despite the diplomatic pressure Washington faces at the United Nations.
NW_AFP_ENG_0008_2003_0327.25
"We are interested in concluding this conflict, not having a pause right now or stopping right now, but concluding this as quickly as possible so we can get on with the rebuilding of Iraq and putting in place a better system of governance," Powell said in an interview with the Al-Jazeera Arab television network.
NW_AFP_ENG_0008_2003_0327.26
Powell, the most moderate member of the Bush cabinet, said he fully agreed with the president's policy on Iraq and had no plans to leave.

NW_AFP_ENG_0014_2003_0502.3
The Times said Vivendi Universal was negotiating to sell its flagship theme parks to New York investment firm Blackstone Group as a the first step toward dismantling its entertainment empire.

Vivendi Universal officials in the United States were not immediately available for comment on Friday.
NW_AFP_ENG_0014_2003_0502.5
Under the reported plans, Blackstone Group would buy Vivendi's theme park division, including Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal Orlando in Florida and Universal's ownership interests in parks in Spain and Japan, a source close to the negotiations told the paper.
NW_AFP_ENG_0014_2003_0502.6
Blackstone already holds a 50 percent stake in the two parks that make up Universal Orlando.
NW_AFP_ENG_0014_2003_0502.7
Vivendi earlier this week confirmed months of press speculation that it planned to shed its entertainment assets by the end of the year, including its famed Universal movie studio and television assets.
NW_AFP_ENG_0014_2003_0502.8
Chief executive Jean-Rene Fourtou told shareholders at the group's annual general meeting Tuesday that the sale of Vivendi Universal Entertainment was a major goal for 2003, and that negotiations were already under way.
NW_AFP_ENG_0014_2003_0502.9
However, Fourtou said he had not yet received any firm offer for its giant US music business, Universal Music Group, and had taken no final decision over its future.

Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom on Wednesday stressed Qatar's role in the Middle East peace process during talks with his Qatari counterpart Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr al-Thani in Paris.
NW_AFP_ENG_0015_2003_0514.2
Shalom told a joint press conference that the tiny Gulf state's strong relationship with the recently appointed Palestinian prime minister, Mahmud Abbas, could be a boost for peace.
NW_AFP_ENG_0015_2003_0514.3
"We discussed the Middle East peace process.
NW_AFP_ENG_0015_2003_0514.4
Over an hour of talks, we asserted the will of both parties (Israel and the Arab world) to do everything to return to the negotiating table," Shalom said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0015_2003_0514.5
"Qatar is a very important country on this issue.
NW_AFP_ENG_0015_2003_0514.6
I know the special relationship that the Qatari foreign minister has with Abu Mazen," he said, using Abbas's alternative name.

The meeting was Shalom's first encounter with an Arab counterpart since he took office as Israel's foreign minister on February 27.

Qatar has economic links with Israel without maintaining diplomatic relations, in the face of criticism from other Arab countries.

Afterwards Shalom was to fly on to London for talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw.

A provincial chief from India's main opposition Congress party has told an election rally that India is suffering nature's "curse" because both the president and prime minister are bachelors, a report said Saturday.
NW_AFP_ENG_0017_2003_0607.2
The Times of India newspaper quoted Digvijay Singh, chief minister of the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, as saying that Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and President Abdul Kalam had offended the Hindu rain God Varuna by remaining bachelors.
NW_AFP_ENG_0017_2003_0607.3
"The country is being ruled by a bachelor president and an unmarried prime minister.
NW_AFP_ENG_0017_2003_0607.4
This according to the Hindu shastras (books) is very inauspicious and that is the reason there is a widespread heatwave and drought," said Singh.
NW_AFP_ENG_0017_2003_0607.5
"Not just Prime Minister Vajpayee but President Kalam's bachelor status is making the country dry, arid and infertile," he added.

The general secretary of Vajpayee's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, Pramod Mahajan, retorted that Singh's statement was "beneath contempt."

The skeleton of a second baby has been found at a rural Wisconsin home where a 22-year-old woman's dead infant was discovered in a blue plastic container June 8, officials said Monday.
NW_AFP_ENG_0018_2003_0616.2
Kristin Scott, the mother, told police she gave birth secretly to both babies at her parents' home in Byrds Creek, Richland County, one of unknown sex in April 2001 and the other, a fullterm girl, January 14.
NW_AFP_ENG_0018_2003_0616.3
Police arrested her in Abilene, Texas, Saturday where she had moved with a friend June 2.
NW_AFP_ENG_0018_2003_0616.4
She is being held on 50,000 dollars bail on a charge of first-degree reckless homicide and hiding a corpse in the death of the infant born in January.
NW_AFP_ENG_0018_2003_0616.5
Scott told police she did not tend to the baby, and it died after 30 minutes.
NW_AFP_ENG_0018_2003_0616.6
She said the baby had to die, according to the criminal complaint.
NW_AFP_ENG_0018_2003_0616.7
The woman's parents, William and Nancy Scott, found the decomposing body of the first baby in her closet after they went looking for the source of a foul odor in their house.

Palestinian security forces returned Monday to the positions they held in the Gaza Strip before the outbreak of the 33-month Palestinian uprising as Israel removed all major checkpoints in the coastal territory, a Palestinian security source said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.2
Police officers took up their positions across the Gaza Strip, enjoying a freedom of movement they have not known since the intifada exploded in September 2000, the source said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.3
"Palestinian police have taken over all the posts and positions they held before September 28, 2000.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.4
It is the first time they have had freedom of movement with cars and weapons since the start of the intifada," the source said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.5
The move marked a huge step forward in carrying out the US-backed Middle East "roadmap", which aims to end the months of bloodshed and create a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.6
Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the northern town of Beit Hanoun late Sunday, police took up positions there and in the neighbouring town of Beit Lahiya, he said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.7
They also deployed along the border with Israel.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.8
The handover is a credibility test for the Palestinian Authority, which must show it means business when it comes to reining in hardline groups plotting attacks on the Jewish state.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.9
In another first in the almost three-year intifada, the Israeli army allowed Palestinians free circulation on the trans-Gaza highway as troops abandoned three major checkpoints across the coastal territory.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.10
Traffic was flowing freely through the Netzarim junction, just south of Gaza City, the Kissufim junction by Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, and the Guest House junction just south of Deir al-Balah after the army withdrew.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.11
The three military checkpoints on the highway, which runs the entire length of the Gaza Strip, had transformed the trip from north to south, ordinarily a 30-minute ride, into a grinding two or three-hour ordeal and came to symbolise the horrors of occupation.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.12
"Israel has implemented most of the agreement except for a few issues," the source said, pointing out that Israel had still not removed two military observation posts at the Kissufim junction and the Guest House junction.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.13
Although there was free movement along the trans-Gaza highway, several other roads remained temporarily closed, he said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.14
The Karni-Netzarim road, which runs east-to-west across the route, was still closed as was the section of the highway passing close by Kfar Darom settlement, just south of the Guest House junction, he said, adding both were likely to be opened in the coming weeks.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.15
Another road, leading from the southern border town of Rafah to Khan Yunis, would be opened within 10 days, he said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.16
Adressing Palestinian complaints, an Israeli military source confirmed troops had installed a gate at the Netzarim crossing and at the southern Guest House junction but said that they were only there for when Jewish settlers needed to use the road.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.17
A ban on Palestinian men under the age of 35 being allowed to move freely was still in force but that was expected to be lifted later on Monday or early Tuesday.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.18
The army also handed over control of Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt to the Palestinians, security sources said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.19
Six Palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the Palestinian section of the border crossing, which had been taken over by Israeli troops shortly after the start of the uprising.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.20
Under the 1993 Oslo accords, which granted a measure of autonomy to the Palestinians, the Rafah border crossing with Egypt was to be jointly managed by both Israel and the Palestinians, although Israel had final control over the zone.
NW_AFP_ENG_0019_2003_0630.21
Although the crossing has, in principle, been open for movement between the two territories -- while being frequently closed by Israeli for reasons rarely explained -- the Palestinian section has been manned by Israel for more than two years.

The floods had also affected central Samastipur and northern Madhubani districts, where villages were under threat, the official said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0020_2004_0619.8
He said heavy rains in mountainous Nepal had caused floods in the state.
NW_AFP_ENG_0020_2004_0619.9
More than 150 people drowned or were washed away in floods in Bihar last year that also damaged property worth millions of rupees including standing crops, according to the state's disaster management department.

Both disasters followed days of monsoon rains.

Environmentalists pointed the finger at massive logging and land conversion for farming on Java, one of the world's most densely populated islands, and called on the government to take action.

NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.3
About 200 people were believed killed and 1,500 others were missing in the central Philippines on Friday when a landslide buried an entire village, the Red Cross said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.4
Eyewitnesses said only a few houses were left standing after the landslide hit the village of Guinsaugon in the south of the Philippine island of Leyte.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.5
"There are about 1,500 missing, 200 dead," Richard Gordon, the head of the Philippine Red Cross, said in a radio interview.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.6
The first footage from the devastated village showed a sea of mud covering what had been lush green valley farmland.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.7
Only a few sheets of tin roofing and the occasional coconut tree could be seen.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.8
Tiny groups of mud-spattered survivors were also shown, walking through the muck, apparently stunned by the scope of the destruction.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.9
In a televised address to the nation, President Gloria Arroyo said rescue teams were rushing to the area from "air, land and sea" to cope with the catastrophe.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.10
"I have ordered the Coast Guard and our entire naval force in the (central Philippines) region to the area," she said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.11
"Naval ships will be used as floating hospitals and command centres for relief and rescue."
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.12
Leyte Governor Rosette Lerias said the latest census indicated there were 375 houses with 3,000 people living in Guinsaugon before the landslide.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.13
She described the village as totally flattened.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.14
"It was like mud running down the mountain and it covered the village in seconds," she said, quoting survivors.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.15
Experts blamed deforestation for the tragedy, which came after days of rainfall that was five times higher than usual.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.16
Lerias said that many Guinsaugon residents had been evacuated after landslides earlier in the week had killed more than 20 people on Leyte, but that many had returned Friday because the rains had stopped and the sun had come out.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.17
A mild 2.6-magnitude earthquake which struck before the landslide may also have helped set off the wall of mud that crashed down on the village, said Rene Solidum, head of the government vulcanology office.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.18
"The area could have really been ready for a landslide because of the amount of rainfall and if there was a minor earthquake, it might have hastened it," Solidum said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.19
Army Colonel Nestor Sadirin, head of a rescue task force, said 16 dead bodies had been recovered so far and 100 people rescued.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.20
Leyte Congressman Roger Mercado said in a radio interview that the village had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 and expressed fears that as many as 2,000 people had been buried.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.21
Lerias called for more rescuers to come to the site to help look for bodies as heavy earth moving equipment could not work in the mud, which officials said was more than six metres (yards) deep in many areas.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.22
Volunteer rescue teams from the country's mining companies, skilled in digging through the earth to rescue people, were also going to the area, said President Arroyo said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.23
Gordon said the Red Cross said was trying to dispatch sniffer dogs to hunt for survivors.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.24
Military helicopters were able to reach the area despite heavy clouds but the flights ceased after nightfall because the aircraft did not have night-flying capabilities.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.25
Lerias said a smaller landslide later in the afternoon caused no damage but left many of the rescuers worried about a possible new disaster.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.26
Relief groups called for drinking water, food, blankets and body bags to be brought to the scene.
NW_AFP_ENG_0024_2006_0217.27
Provincial board member Eva Dumol said in a radio interview that heavy equipment that was already in the area to clear up earlier landslides was being sent to the Guinasaugon area.

NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.3
Muddy waters receded in Bangladesh and other parts of South Asia on Saturday but disease and hunger stalked millions of people hit by the worst monsoon flooding in decades.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.4
The inundation has been linked to at least 2,200 deaths in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan, the United Nations said in a statement, as illness loomed over a vast number of people.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.5
Diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera and typhoid threatened the millions affected by the deluge who still lack safe drinking water, medicine and hygienic food.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.6
"Even in the worst floods in 1998, we did not have as many patients.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.7
It's like a war," said Ramzan Ali, the manager of Bangladesh's biggest hospital for diarrhoea sufferers in Dhaka, the country's capital.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.8
"We have put up tents in the parking lot and open spaces to set up makeshift wards," Ali said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.9
Some 1,000 patients were admitted with diarrhoea on Friday, Ali said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.10
More than 70,000 people have been hospitalised with water-borne diseases, said Aisha Akhter, the head of the Bangladesh government's health control room.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.11
More than half of those patients had diarrhoea amid an acute shortage of clean water, the official added.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.12
Nearly 10 million people have been affected in low-lying Bangladesh but five of its 38 districts hit by the inundation were now "flood-free" and water was receding elsewhere, government spokesman Aminul Islam said.

UN Emergency Relief Coordinator John Holmes announced in a statement that the world body would provide up to 20 million dollars for relief operations in South Asia.

In India's eastern state of Bihar, one of the worst hit, most rivers were flowing below danger levels.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.16
The torrential rains had affected nearly 15 million people in 7,255 villages, officials said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.17
The situation was also better in the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Orissa, where water levels were falling, officials said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.18
"While the flood situation is improving it will take six to seven days for it to normalize and that also if there are no fresh rains in this period," said Uttar Pradesh relief commissioner Umesh Sinha.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.19
Indian Air Force helicopters and army motor boats had ferried relief supplies to affected people, officials said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.20
"Fortunately, we haven't had heavy rains in the past few days," said Marzio Babille, the country head of the United Nations Children's Fund.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.21
But many were still at risk from disease, he added.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.22
"The situation is improving," Babille told the Press Trust of India, but "we are very worried about the outbreak of diseases like malaria, cholera, diarrhoea and measles.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.23
People in remotest areas faced serious food shortages, raising concerns about malnutrition too.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.24
"Under-nutrition and malnutrition threaten the lives of such people most, and in our assessment, they would be major factors in increase in morbidity in the coming days," he said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0025_2007_0811.25
The subcontinent's annual monsoon rains from June to September are crucial for farming, which remains key to the South Asian economy, but the heavy downpours can also bring death and destruction.

"We foresee a 90 percent loss in vegetable growth which will have a grim impact on per capita nutritional intake," warned B.C. Chowdhury, the chief researcher at Bihar's Agriculture University.

Skier killed in NZ avalanche

WELLINGTON, Aug 14, 2009
NW_AFP_ENG_0026_2009_0814.3
A guide with a ski party was killed by an avalanche on Friday in New Zealand's South Island in the second such accident in the area in the past month, police and the guiding company said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0026_2009_0814.4
The man killed was a guide with a party of four skiers taken into the Ragged Ranges area west of the city of Christchurch, the Alpine Guides company said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0026_2009_0814.5
The guide had been inspecting the ski runs when he was caught by the avalanche late in the afternoon, Alpine Guides managing director Bryan Carter told the New Zealand Press Association.
NW_AFP_ENG_0026_2009_0814.6
"He was subsequently located and dug out by other guides," Carter said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0026_2009_0814.7
"He was unconscious and despite treatment... over the next two hours, I understand, unfortunately he didn't survive."
NW_AFP_ENG_0026_2009_0814.8
An earlier police report said another skier in the party had been seriously injured but Carter said he understood none of the four clients were caught in the avalanche.
NW_AFP_ENG_0026_2009_0814.9
"One of them has a twisted back or a bit of a back injury, but nothing serious," he added.
NW_AFP_ENG_0026_2009_0814.10
Fog in the area had caused problems during the rescue, in which the other skiers had been taken out of the area to safety.
NW_AFP_ENG_0026_2009_0814.11
Last month a 60-year-old Australian tourist was killed when he and another skier was buried in an avalanche which also occurred in the Ragged Range, near the town of Methven.

Australian state adopts 'code red' wildfire warning
NW_AFP_ENG_0027_2009_0831.2
Melbourne, Aug 31, 2009
NW_AFP_ENG_0027_2009_0831.3
Australian state authorities said Monday they would introduce a new "code red" warning for extreme wildfires like those that killed 173 people earlier this year.
NW_AFP_ENG_0027_2009_0831.4
Victoria Premier John Brumby said the so-called "Black Saturday" fires that swept across the state on February 7 were unlike the regular bushfires seen in Australia and needed their own warning category.
NW_AFP_ENG_0027_2009_0831.5
He said a code red fire warning meant residents should immediately evacuate before the deadly flames bore down on their homes.
NW_AFP_ENG_0027_2009_0831.6
"Looking forward there's going to be a greater emphasis on going early, so you would make it very clear that this is a very bad day which is coming up and if you're going, you make sure you're going early," he told reporters.
NW_AFP_ENG_0027_2009_0831.7
"So you could have something that says: low, medium, high, extreme, code red, and a code red would be a day like a February 7, those most extreme days."
NW_AFP_ENG_0027_2009_0831.8
Entire towns and more than 2,000 homes were destroyed in February's firestorm, killing 173 people in Australia's worst natural disaster of modern times.
NW_AFP_ENG_0027_2009_0831.9
The new warning system comes amid renewed fears about the fire threat in the upcoming southern hemisphere summer, with blazes already flaring in New South Wales state more than a month before the official fire season normally starts.
NW_AFP_ENG_0027_2009_0831.10
Authorities said a fire that forced evacuations over the weekend near Dolphin Point, about 230 kilometres (143 miles) south of Sydney, was still raging in bushland but was no longer threatening homes.

SYDNEY, Nov 17, 2009
NW_AFP_ENG_0028_2009_1117.3
Australian officials issued their first ever "catastrophic" wildfire evacuation warning Tuesday, as a parching heatwave intensified over the country's south.
NW_AFP_ENG_0028_2009_1117.4
Created in the wake of February's devastating Black Saturday firestorm, which killed 173 people, the new warning urges residents to flee due to conditions being at their most extreme.
NW_AFP_ENG_0028_2009_1117.5
It replaced a "stay or go" policy allowing homeowners to remain and fight extremely risky blazes, which came under heavy criticism after the February disaster.
NW_AFP_ENG_0028_2009_1117.6
Catastrophic or Code Red conditions were declared for the first time in South Australia state Tuesday, where the temperature was forecast to top 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) following an earlier record-breaking heatwave.
NW_AFP_ENG_0028_2009_1117.7
"In the next couple of days we are going to see high temperatures, very low humidity and very strong winds," said fire service chief Euan Ferguson.
NW_AFP_ENG_0028_2009_1117.8
"This is the first real test for the summer."
NW_AFP_ENG_0028_2009_1117.9
Code Red conditions are considered on a par with those experienced ahead of the Black Saturday fires, which in Victoria state razed entire towns and more than 2,000 homes, Australia's worst natural disaster of modern times. Residents cannot be forcibly evacuated but are strongly advised to leave their property on a Code Red day, which signifies a high risk of death or injury and destruction.
NW_AFP_ENG_0028_2009_1117.10
"To ensure your survival you should leave tonight or early tomorrow morning, well before a fire starts," the fire service said in its official warning.
NW_AFP_ENG_0028_2009_1117.11
South Australia sweltered through a record-breaking eight days of extreme temperatures last week, leaving bushland and pastoral areas tinder-dry and vulnerable to fast-moving and uncontrollable flames.
NW_AFP_ENG_0028_2009_1117.12
It was the state's first-ever November heatwave, and Ferguson said he had never seen so much combustible material so early in the southern hemisphere summer.

Some 2,000 firefighters tackled the fires in New South Wales, where a large blaze was burning dangerously close to farming properties in the state's northwest.

"A fire is burning in very high fire-danger conditions, and is currently between two and six hours away from properties," the Rural Fire Service (RFS) said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0029_2009_1210.6
"Under these conditions fires can be difficult to control and flames may burn from the ground to the tree-tops."
NW_AFP_ENG_0029_2009_1210.7
It urged residents of Bundarra and Barraba towns to be ready to evacuate, warning that "fires will be uncontrollable, unpredictable and fast moving".

New South Wales and neighbouring Queensland, which was also fighting several fires, suffered sweltering conditions on Thursday with temperatures approaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).

"Really we have got so many fires ... any number of them may pose a risk," said RFS assistant commissioner Rob Rogers.
NW_AFP_ENG_0029_2009_1210.10
The RFS later said conditions were expected to ease on Friday from around 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), giving some relief to firefighters.

"We've got a lot of fire crews working to contain the fire and protect isolated rural properties in the area," Clark said, adding that a change in wind direction was expected later.
NW_AFP_ENG_0031_2009_1217.8
"That may cause some further challenging conditions for us.
NW_AFP_ENG_0031_2009_1217.9
It will whip up the wind and that can also fan the fire in a new direction," he said.

More than 80 wildfires were burning in New South Wales with about a dozen out of control, fire officials said.

Wildfires have destroyed 10 homes and hundreds of livestock in eastern Australia, officials said Friday, as residents recounted the trauma of facing the infernos.
NW_AFP_ENG_0032_2009_1218.4
Blistering heat and windy conditions fanned 100 fires across New South Wales on Thursday, including one in Sydney, and left 1,000 sheep and 200 cattle dead in their wake, the Rural Fire Service said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0032_2009_1218.5
"We had terrible fire conditions -- hot, windy, everything else like that," said Lindsay Perrin, whose home narrowly escaped the flames in Michelago south of the national capital Canberra.
NW_AFP_ENG_0032_2009_1218.6
"We're up a hill from what was the fire front, so it just ran, it just flew up.

"It's a much better day today."

Fire authorities are most concerned about the Michelago fire because it has now entered rugged mountain country, making it more difficult to access, McDonald said.

Climate change to triple Australia fire danger: report
NW_AFP_ENG_0035_2010_0128.2
SYDNEY, Jan 28, 2010
NW_AFP_ENG_0035_2010_0128.3
Climate change could more than triple the risk of catastrophic wildfires in parts of Australia, a top environmental group warned Thursday, almost a year since savage firestorms that killed 173 people.
NW_AFP_ENG_0035_2010_0128.4
Greenpeace warned that, without a new climate treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol, the frequency of severe fire danger in drought-parched southeastern Australia would grow threefold by 2050.
NW_AFP_ENG_0035_2010_0128.5
"Catastrophic" conditions similar to those ahead of February's so-called "Black Saturday" wildfires which killed 173 people in towns around Melbourne would occur once every three years, instead of once in every 33.
NW_AFP_ENG_0035_2010_0128.6
"The frequency of catastrophic fire danger could increase more than tenfold in Melbourne, and the number of total fire ban days could triple in Sydney, Adelaide and Canberra by 2050," according to a Greenpeace report entitled "Future Risk."
NW_AFP_ENG_0035_2010_0128.7
If targets for emission cuts proposed by world leaders at December's Copenhagen summit were adopted in a new global treaty, southeastern Australia would still face at least a doubling of severe fire risk, Greenpeace said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0035_2010_0128.8
"If we do nothing to address climate change we are knowingly placing more lives and property at risk," said Greenpeace CEO Linda Selvey.
NW_AFP_ENG_0035_2010_0128.9
According to the report temperatures in Australia had warmed an average 0.9 degrees Celsius (33.6 F) since 1950, with the greatest intensification of heat in the country's east, which was accompanied by markedly declining rainfall.
NW_AFP_ENG_0035_2010_0128.10
"Hotter, drier weather is a recipe for bushfire disaster in regions of Australia home to the majority of the population," it said, adding that the changing climate had "noticeably" prolonged the annual fire season.
NW_AFP_ENG_0035_2010_0128.11
The February 7 Black Saturday fires were the worst natural disaster in Australia's modern history, with one expert likening their intensity to the energy produced by 1,500 Hiroshima atomic bombs.

Quake destroyed up to 50 percent of Haiti GDP: president
NW_AFP_ENG_0038_2010_0225.2
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Feb 25, 2010
NW_AFP_ENG_0038_2010_0225.3
The earthquake that ravaged Haiti last month destroyed up to 50 percent of the Caribbean nation's gross domestic product, Haitian President Rene Preval said Thursday.
NW_AFP_ENG_0038_2010_0225.4
"This earthquake... led to the deaths of 200,000 to 300,000 people and destroyed from 35 to 50 percent of the GDP," Preval said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0038_2010_0225.5
He spoke after meeting Brazil counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva at a UN- Brazilian military base in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, which was devastated by the January 12 earthquake.
NW_AFP_ENG_0038_2010_0225.6
"What is important now is to strengthen the Haitian government," said Lula, adding a personal entreaty to the Haitian people: "at this moment of pain, at this moment of desperation, we must lift our heads up."
NW_AFP_ENG_0038_2010_0225.7
Lula called on the international community to cancel Haiti's debt, and officials from the two governments signed agreements to aid Haitian farmers and schools, which were hard hit in the quake.
NW_AFP_ENG_0038_2010_0225.8
According to the United Nations, estimates show 5,000 schools were damaged or destroyed in Haiti, which was already the poorest country in the Americas before catastrophe struck.
NW_AFP_ENG_0038_2010_0225.9
Lula referred to a recent South American summit's pledge of 300 million dollars in aid for Haiti, highlighting an agreement to create a 100 million dollar fund to help the Haitian government with immediate needs.

He also attended a Brazilian military ceremony at the base where he met Preval.

Brazil, which heads a UN force here, saw 18 of its peacekeepers killed in the 7.0-magnitude quake.
NW_AFP_ENG_0038_2010_0225.13
Two Brazilian civilians were also killed: the deputy UN head of the peacekeeping mission, Luis Carlos da Costa, and a high-profile children's rights campaigner, Zilda Arns.
NW_AFP_ENG_0038_2010_0225.14
Following the quake last month, Brazil decided to double its UN force in Haiti to 2,600 as well as authorize 205 million dollars in aid for the country.
NW_AFP_ENG_0038_2010_0225.15
The Haitian government's death toll for the quake is more than 222,500, though bodies are believed to remain buried under the mounds of rubble throughout Port- au-Prince.

Inquiry slams 'systemic failings' in killer Australia fires
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.2
SYDNEY, July 31, 2010
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.3
An official inquiry into Australian wildfires which killed 173 people Saturday found there were "systemic failings" of leadership and chaos had plagued the emergency response.
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.4
Australia's worst ever natural disaster, the so-called "Black Saturday" fires in February 2009 reduced entire towns to ash, razing 2,133 homes.
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.5
Many of those who perished died trying to save their homes, and Saturday's report recommended a shakeup of firefighting agencies and changes to the "stay or go" policy -- under which residents can choose to defend their properties and authorities cannot forcibly evacuate them.
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.6
The Royal Commission report said the policy's "central tenets ... remain sound" but there needed to be a greater emphasis on early evacuation being the safest option, and a recognition that some fires were simply not defendable.
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.7
"The rigours of mounting a defence in the face of fires such as those on Black Saturday caught many by surprise," the commission said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.8
Nearly half of those who died were classed as "vulnerable", the report said, because they were aged under 12 or over 70, or because they were suffering from some illness or disability.
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.9
The commission found that the response "faltered because of confusion about responsibilities and accountabilities and some important deficiencies of leadership."
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.10
No single agency took charge of the emergency and the chain of command was unclear, with leadership "wanting", particularly from the then-police commissioner Christine Nixon, who went out to dinner as the disaster reached its peak, the inquiry said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.11
"When considered collectively, the problems illustrate systemic failings," it said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.12
Widespread problems with radios and telephones made it difficult to track the response and at times "conditions were chaotic on the fireground", it said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.13
Warnings to communities were too vague and there was inadequate evacuation or provision of shelters and refuges for those in the fire's path.
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.14
The report recommended urgent upgrade of ageing electricity infrastructure in fire-prone areas, with one-third of the most dangerous blazes directly caused by fallen power lines or other electricity assets.
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.15
"The seriousness of the risk and the need to protect human life are imperatives (authorities) cannot ignore," it said.
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.16
It also called for the government to buy out and resettle people living in unacceptably high-risk areas and ban building there, as well as requiring buildings in fire areas to adhere to stricter standards.
NW_AFP_ENG_0040_2010_0731.17
Backburning -- deliberately burning off areas of bush to reduce fuel for wildfires -- should also be ramped up to five percent of public land every year, the Commission said, from the current level of 1.7 percent.

I wish I could have been at a Pub, or wherever these people convene, to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this morning (emphasis added): Britain's gun laws are aimed at the wrong target, curbing and criminalising legal ownership while failing to tackle huge rises in shooting offences over the past few years, according to an international firearms legislation expert.
NW_AGV_ENG_0041_2004_1101.2
Prof Gary Mauser said that Britain was making the same mistake as Canada and Australia in focusing on legal owners - a section of the law-abiding community where gun crimes, such as the Dunblane massacre, were aberrations.
NW_AGV_ENG_0041_2004_1101.3
The Home Office and police chiefs should instead tackle the possession of guns in criminal hands, said Prof Mauser, a member of the independent Fraser Institute in Canada.
NW_AGV_ENG_0041_2004_1101.4
He has given evidence to select committees of the House of Commons and the Canadian Senate and predicted the escalation of gun crime on Britain's streets.
NW_AGV_ENG_0041_2004_1101.5
His warning comes as gun crime incidents are averaging about 29 a day in England and Wales, more than twice the level of when the Labour Government came to power in 1997 .
NW_AGV_ENG_0041_2004_1101.6
In the past two years, there have been cases of schoolchildren and a baby, killed or injured by guns.

"I believe that factors of political correctness are at work," he said.
NW_AGV_ENG_0041_2004_1101.8
"Police crackdowns, Home Office initiatives and over-regulation of legally held weapons create froth and they may even fool the police themselves into believing they are doing something about gun crime."
NW_AGV_ENG_0041_2004_1101.9
Prof Mauser added: "The sad truth is that while the police officers are inspecting farmers' gun cabinets to see if they comply with regulations somewhere in the UK, someone, who has not filled in a firearms certificate form, will be smuggling a gun into the country or selling one to an inner city youth."
NW_AGV_ENG_0041_2004_1101.10

Shouts of approval and applause arose from the estimated 2,300 soldiers who had assembled to see Rumsfeld.
NW_AGV_ENG_0042_2004_1208.6
"We do not have proper armored vehicles to carry with us north," Wilson, 31, of Nashville, Tenn., concluded after asking again.
NW_AGV_ENG_0042_2004_1208.7
Wilson, an airplane mechanic whose unit, the 278th Regimental Combat Team of the Tennessee Army National Guard, is about to drive north into Iraq for a one-year tour of duty, put his finger on a problem that has bedeviled the Pentagon for more than a year.
NW_AGV_ENG_0042_2004_1208.8
Rarely, though, is it put so bluntly in a public forum.
NW_AGV_ENG_0042_2004_1208.9
Rumsfeld said the Army was sparing no expense or effort to acquire as many Humvees and other vehicles with extra armor as it can.
NW_AGV_ENG_0042_2004_1208.10
What is more, he said, armor is not the savior some think it is.
NW_AGV_ENG_0042_2004_1208.11
"You can have all the armor in the world on a tank and a tank can (still) be blown up," he said.

From the Associated Press : City residents will vote next year on a proposed weapons ban that would deny handguns to everyone except law enforcement officers, members of the military and security guards.
NW_AGV_ENG_0043_2004_1215.2
If passed next November, residents would have 90 days to give up firearms they keep in their homes or businesses.
NW_AGV_ENG_0043_2004_1215.3
The proposal was immediately dismissed as illegal by a gun owners group.
NW_AGV_ENG_0043_2004_1215.4
Firearms would be allowed only for police officers, security guards, members of the military, and anyone else "actually employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or her employment," according to the measure.
NW_AGV_ENG_0043_2004_1215.5
Gun Owners of California, a Sacramento-based lobbying group, quickly called the ban illegal.
NW_AGV_ENG_0043_2004_1215.6
Sam Paredes, the group's executive director, said state law bars local governments from usurping the state's authority to regulate firearms.
NW_AGV_ENG_0043_2004_1215.7
"The amazing thing is they are going to turn San Francisco into ground zero for every criminal who wants to profit at their chosen profession," Paredes said.
NW_AGV_ENG_0043_2004_1215.8
Washington, D.C., is the only major American city that currently bans handgun possession by private citizens.
NW_AGV_ENG_0043_2004_1215.9
Andrew Arulanandam, director of public affairs for the National Rifle Association, said San Francisco would be remiss to use that city as a model.
NW_AGV_ENG_0043_2004_1215.10
"If gun control worked, Washington, D.C., would be the beacon.
NW_AGV_ENG_0043_2004_1215.11
However, it's the murder capital of the United States," he said.
NW_AGV_ENG_0043_2004_1215.12
If approved, the weapons ban would take effect in January 2006.

Quote of the day: "Firearms would be allowed only for police officers, security guards, members of the military, and anyone else actually employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or her employment."

Bobbie Jo Stinnett, 23, was found Thursday in a pool of blood inside her small white home in Skidmore, a town in northwest Missouri.
NW_AGV_ENG_0044_2004_1218.5
Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant, had earlier been talking with her mother on the phone, and hung up saying a woman she had chatted with online had just arrived at her door, authorities said.
NW_AGV_ENG_0044_2004_1218.6
U.S. Attorney Todd Graves said Montgomery contacted Stinnett through an online message board, and authorities zeroed in on her using computer forensics.
NW_AGV_ENG_0044_2004_1218.7
Montgomery was seeking to buy a dog from Stinnett, who raised rat terriers, he said.
NW_AGV_ENG_0044_2004_1218.8
According to the criminal complaint, Montgomery traveled about 40 miles to Topeka, Kan., on Thursday to go shopping.
NW_AGV_ENG_0044_2004_1218.9
Her husband received a call from her saying she had gone into labor and given birth.
NW_AGV_ENG_0044_2004_1218.10
The next day, authorities say, Montgomery confessed that she strangled Stinnett from behind, cut her open, removed the baby and cut her umbilical cord.

I don't understand how we can call this fetus-thing that was ripped from a mother's womb a "child" or "girl" in a society that sanctions partial-birth abortion.

If you can't charge someone for killing a fetus via abortion during the eighth month, then surely you can't make a big deal about a woman who kidnapped a fetus that survived the knifing.

Feminists have a reason to celebrate today as an appeals court just threw out the convictions of their martyr, Andrea Yates, by ruling that one of the prosecutor's expert witnesses gave false testimony at her trial.
NW_AGV_ENG_0045_2005_0106.2
Yates, in case you have forgotten, is the women from Texas who heinously drowned her five kids, aged 6 months to 7 years, one by one, in her bathtub.
NW_AGV_ENG_0045_2005_0106.3
Liberal feminist organizations rushed to Yates' defense, most notably the National Organization for Women, which provided money for her defense fund and held candlelight vigils.
NW_AGV_ENG_0045_2005_0106.4
No such ceremonies were held for her five dead children.
NW_AGV_ENG_0045_2005_0106.5
In 2002 a jury sentenced Yates to life in prison for the deaths of three of her children.
NW_AGV_ENG_0045_2005_0106.6
She was not tried in the deaths of the other two.
NW_AGV_ENG_0045_2005_0106.7

The blood red nation of China is trying to curb the effects of a devastating 20-year-old policy that outlawed women from having more than one child.
NW_AGV_ENG_0046_2005_0107.2
As a result, only about 100 girls are born for every 119 boys, because couples traditionally favor males.
NW_AGV_ENG_0046_2005_0107.3
Beijing has set a goal of reversing the imbalance by 2010, and to do this they will outlaw the selective abortion of female fetuses to correct an imbalance in the ratio of boys to girls.
NW_AGV_ENG_0046_2005_0107.4
So now by killing the males they can hopefully narrow the gender gap.

What a country!
NW_AGV_ENG_0046_2005_0107.6
From Reuters : Sex-selective abortion is already banned but technologies such as ultrasound have made it easier to know a baby's gender in advance, increasing the chances for aborting girls.

Despite a desire to curb the sex imbalance and a relaxation in recent years that allows rural families to have two children if the first is a girl, China has shown no sign of abandoning the one-child policy and cracks down on those who advocate against it.

NW_AGV_ENG_0049_2005_0213.2
The gunman began shooting inside the Hudson Valley Mall shortly after 3 p.m. in Kingston, nearly 90 miles north of New York City.
NW_AGV_ENG_0049_2005_0213.3
The 24-year-old gunman went into a Best Buy store and started firing.

When he ran out of ammunition, he was captured by mall employees, police said.

From the St. Pete Times : Some Florida legislators want to give people the right to shoot an attacker in a public place.
NW_AGV_ENG_0050_2005_0224.2
A House committee voted Wednesday to allow people to shoot to kill in self-defense if they are attacked "in any other place where he or she has a right to be."

State law defines deadly force as that which is likely to cause "death or great bodily harm," such as firing a gun at a person or a vehicle.
NW_AGV_ENG_0050_2005_0224.5
Florida courts consider deadly force a last resort and have held that a person being attacked has the "duty to use every reasonable means to avoid the danger, including retreat, prior to using deadly force."
NW_AGV_ENG_0050_2005_0224.6
But this legislation says a person who is under attack in a public place "has no duty to retreat."
NW_AGV_ENG_0050_2005_0224.7
"Law-abiding people should not be told that if they are attacked, they should turn around and run," NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer told lawmakers.

"This bill gives back rights that have been eroded and taken away by a judicial system that at times appears to give preferential treatment to criminals."

Baxley held up a stack of more than 800 e-mails from Floridians who he said have written him to support the bill.
NW_AGV_ENG_0050_2005_0224.10
He said 62 House members, a majority, have endorsed his bill, and supporters include Attorney General Charlie Crist and groups representing Florida sheriffs, police chiefs and police officers.

Rep. Jeff Kottkamp, R-Cape Coral, said the bill reminded him of a sign he saw on a constituent's house while campaigning door-to-door.

Slobodan Milosevic's wife will go on trial next week on charges of mismanaging state property during the former president's rule, a court said Thursday.
NW_APW_ENG_0051_2003_0306.2
Mirjana Markovic, the power behind the scenes during Milosevic's 13-year reign, is accused of illegally providing their grandson's nanny with a state-owned luxury apartment in Belgrade in 2000.
NW_APW_ENG_0051_2003_0306.3
The Belgrade district court said that Markovic will be tried along with 10 other Milosevic-era officials who face similar charges of ``inappropriate use of state property'' that carry a sentence of up to five years in jail.

The charismatic leader of Turkey's governing party was named prime minister Tuesday, a step that probably boosts chances that the United States will get permission to deploy troops in the country along Iraq's northern border.
NW_APW_ENG_0052_2003_0311.2
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who favors the deployment, hinted that he will reshuffle the Cabinet, but gave no indication if he would purge officials who opposed letting in the troops as analysts have suggested he might do.
NW_APW_ENG_0052_2003_0311.3
Erdogan is extremely popular in Turkey and is likely be one of the few leaders with enough clout to unite his party and gain public support for allowing in the U.S. troops.

Turks overwhelmingly oppose a war -- by 94 percent, according to some polls.

Earlier this month, the Turkish parliament shocked the United States by rejecting the deployment by just four votes.

Also in Washington, Turkish Ambassador Farouk Logoglu told The Associated Press that the U.S. and Turkish militaries were holding informal discussions on the use of Turkish airspace.
NW_APW_ENG_0052_2003_0311.12
The troop-basing resolution would allow the United States to use Turkish airspace.
NW_APW_ENG_0052_2003_0311.13
If the resolution is not passed, Washington would likely want to use the airspace for strikes against Iraq and for airlifting troops to northern Iraq.
NW_APW_ENG_0052_2003_0311.14
Refusing access to the troop deployment would mean Turkey would lose a US$15 billion U.S. aid package that Washington has offered to help cushion the country's economy if there is war.

Tensions over the basing agreement spilled over into parliament Tuesday when opposition deputy Ufuk Ozkan shouted ``You are all American lackeys!'' at members of Erdogan's party, the Anatolia news agency reported.

U.S. and British troops were moving on the strategic southern port city of Basra Saturday after a massive aerial assault pounded Baghdad at dawn.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.2
Thousands of beleaguered Iraqi soldiers in the south surrendered in the face of the major push.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.3
The battle for Basra, an oil hub of some 1.3 million people, was underway by midday, with coalition troops trying to surround Iraqi positions and force a surrender.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.4
U.S. aircraft bombed Iraqi tanks holding bridges close to the city.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.5
Iraqi forces responded with artillery fire.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.6
Earlier Saturday, Baghdad was again targeted, one day after a massive U.S. aerial bombardment in which more than 300 Tomahawk cruise missiles rained down on the capital.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.7
The nine-story Security Headquarters in the Iraqi capital took a direct hit, strewing bricks, masonry and glass across the street in the al-Salhiya neighborhood of central Baghdad.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.8
As coalition troops advanced, an entire Iraqi army division gave itself up, U.S. military officials said.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.9
The division -- the 51st Infantry Division, with 8,000 men and as many as 200 tanks, a key unit in the defense of Basra -- was the largest defection in a day when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's forces showed signs of crumbling.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.10
Allied successes were marred by the collision of two Royal Navy helicopters over the Persian Gulf in which all six British crew members and one American were killed.

Saturday morning, American Marines and British troops rumbled along the main road from the Kuwaiti border to Basra, Highway 80, nicknamed the ``Highway of Death'' during the 1991 Gulf War, when U.S. airstrikes wiped out an Iraqi military convoy along it.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.12
American units advancing west of Basra have already secured the Rumeila oil field, whose daily output of 1.3 million barrels makes it Iraq's most productive.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.13
Until Basra, U.S. and British troops had encountered little resistance, even when they seized nearby Umm Qasr, and moved to secure key oil fields.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.14
Iraqis mostly fought back with small arms, pistols, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.15
Regular Iraqi forces had withdrawn from Basra but elements of Saddam's security forces are continuing to resist, British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said Saturday.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.16
Other units moved into airfield complexes in western Iraq believed to have Scud missiles capable of reaching Israel, and possibly weapons of mass destruction.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.17
Early Saturday, more units were waiting in Kuwait to smash through any Iraqi resistance.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.18
Hundreds of tanks, armored personnel carriers, Humvees and trucks were lined up in parallel columns waiting in single-file to cross the Iraqi-Kuwait border.

After weeks of delay, Turkey relented and agreed to let combat aircraft fly over its territory.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.21
At the same time, however, Turkey sent 1,000 troops into northern Iraq, and the government said it would send more to prevent Iraqi Kurds from creating an independent state.

In an address Saturday, Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf told Iraqis that fighting had been ``fierce.''
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.28
He said most of those captured by allied forces were civilians, not soldiers.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.29
He claimed Iraqi troops had destroyed five tanks.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.30
He said more than 200 Iraqis had been injured, including women, children and other civilians who were being treated at five hospitals in Baghdad.

Iraqi Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan, speaking on Iraqi Radio, was quoted by the British Broadcasting Corp.'s monitoring service as accusing Britain and the United States of working to ``eliminate'' the state of Iraq.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.34
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Ramadan said, ``It is also regrettable and deplorable that the (U.N.) General Secretariat has not issued any statement or reaction that condemns or deplores this aggression.''

Despite the heavy bombing, which the U.S. Central Command said targeted military command and control installations, the Iraqi regime gave no sign of quitting.
NW_APW_ENG_0053_2003_0322.36
Bombers have also hit targets in the northern cities of Mosul, Kirkuk and Tikrit, Saddam's hometown.

U.S. intelligence officials said the Iraqi command and control system was in disarray, and U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said, ``The regime is starting to lose control of their country.''
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.1
Kurdish militiamen and U.S. special operations troops linked up with more than 1,000 U.S. Army paratroopers Thursday to secure the area around a strategic air strip, as the first large coalition ground force in northern Iraq began opening another front against Saddam Hussein's regime.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.2
The Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade , including elite Army Rangers, jumped out of low-flying C-17 transport planes under cover of darkness Wednesday and secured a snow-dusted airfield, which will be used to bring in supplies and support personnel.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.3
The airdrop -- one of the biggest paratroop drops in decades -- was a dramatic entry for ground troops into a region where only small groups of U.S. special forces have been operating.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.4
Coalition airstrikes have been hitting Iraqi military forces and other strategic targets in the north.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.5
``This tightens the noose against Saddam's forces battling coalition forces to the south,'' Brig. Gen. James Parker, commander of U.S. forces in the north.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.6
``And it may also serve as a warning to Turkish forces.''
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.7
Giving cover for the deployment, U.S. warplanes struck Iraqi ground troops and bunkers in northern Iraq.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.8
Three waves of combat planes from the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt hit ``ground troops, command and control bunkers, artillery positions and ... a surface to air missile battery,'' said Lt. John Oliveira, the ship's public affair officer.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.9
Around dawn Thursday, strikes resumed, with a massive explosion just outside the Kurdish zone close to the village of Kalak.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.10
Warplanes pounded forward Iraqi positions in the hills overlooking Chamchamal, 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of the key oil city of Kirkuk.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.11
Later Thursday, Kurdish troops in Chamchamal advanced their positions between government-controlled and rebel-controlled areas, taking over a Iraqi check point on their front with no fighting at this point, witnesses said.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.12
Early Thursday, Kurdish fighters closed off a highway and roads near the airstrip where troops were said to be arriving, outside the town of Bashur, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of the Kurd-controlled city of Irbil and 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of the Turkish border.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.13
From the highway, dusted from a recent snow, a flashing light from the airstrip's control tower was visible in the distance, and three helicopters could be seen landing, flying with nearly all their lights extinguished.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.14
Future airlifts into the area will include supplies and support personnel for the 173rd's fighters, defense officials said.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.15
The airfield's 6,700-foot (2,042-meter) runway is long enough to land C-17s and other U.S. military cargo planes.

Lt. Col. Thomas Collins, a spokesman for the U.S. Army's Southern European Task Force, refused to say whether the paratroopers deployed directly from Italy into Iraq or had taken a different route.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.17
The matter immediately sparked controversy in Italy, where there is a strong anti-war movement.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.18
The country's parliament voted this month to allow U.S.-led coalition forces to use Italian air space and military bases -- but not for directs attacks on Iraq.

Pentagon officials have said for weeks they would have U.S. forces in northern Iraq to open another front against Saddam's forces.

The vast majority of the coalition ground troops in Iraq are moving toward Baghdad from the south after entering from Kuwait.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.21
Pentagon officials had hoped to have the Army's 4th Infantry Division invade Iraq from the north, but Turkey balked at allowing up to 62,000 U.S. troops on its soil to prepare for that option.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.22
The use of the 173rd shows the military has shifted to a smaller, lighter force.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.23
Military officials say they would have liked to have secured key oil fields around the northern cities of Mosul and Kirkuk -- and perhaps the cities themselves -- by now.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.24
Though no hostilities were expected during the deployment, the 173rd decided to parachute in rather then ferry troops in by plane so that a significant combat force could mass almost immediately to protect itself, officers said, according to a U.S. reporter traveling with the 173rd.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.25
``Kirkuk is key.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.26
The Iraqi's want it, the Kurds want it, the Turks want it and various other ethnic groups also want it,'' Maj. Mike Hastings said.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.27
``What this drop means is that we can secure it until we are relieved by other forces.''
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.28
Besides Mosul and Kirkuk, another key target in northern Iraq is Tikrit, Saddam's hometown and the tribal center for most of his inner circle.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.29
Most of the Adnan Division of the Republican Guard relocated from the Mosul area to the Tikrit area shortly before the war began.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.30
Another key mission for the 173rd could be to keep order in northern Iraq, which is controlled by two semi-autonomous Kurdish factions but also includes several splinter groups and a base for the al-Qaida-linked Ansar al-Islam.
NW_APW_ENG_0054_2003_0327.31

Former Danish international Stig Toefting dropped his appeal of an assault conviction and will serve a four-month jail sentence, Denmark's TV2 reported Monday.

Neither Toefting or Nemeth were immediately available for comment.

Earlier this month, Toefting said English Premier League club Bolton let him go so he could prepare for the appeal.
NW_APW_ENG_0055_2003_0331.8
It was unclear whether Toefting would return to Bolton after serving his sentence.
NW_APW_ENG_0055_2003_0331.9
The club said it wasn't aware of Toefting's decision to drop his appeal.

Toefting transferred to Bolton in February 2002 from German club Hamburg.

For the first time in the war, large parts of Baghdad lost electricity.

At one stage, it appeared that U.S. forces had taken control of the airport, ``and then it got more confusing with continued fighting, Myers said Thursday night.
NW_APW_ENG_0056_2003_0403.14
Capture of the airport would give American and British troops a facility for airlifting equipment and troops to Baghdad.

Iraqi officials, however, remained defiant, saying Iraq's forces would never surrender to American forces: ``They will be burnt,'' said Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf.

In central Baghdad, a Reuters cameraman and a cameraman for Spain's Telecinco died when an American tank fired on the Palestine Hotel.

U.S. Central Command said it fired on the TV office and the hotel after U.S. forces came under ``significant'' fire from those buildings.

Associated Press photographer Jerome Delay said he watched from the top floor of the hotel as American tanks took up positions on the bridge.

It was not clear whether any Iraqi leader had been killed in the airstrike targeting Saddam in an upscale Baghdad neighborhood.

``There will be a vital role for the U.N. in the reconstruction of Iraq,'' Blair said.

Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Mohammed Al-Douri, the first Iraqi official to concede defeat in the U.S.-led war, met privately with Secretary-General Kofi Annan, but refused to talk about rumors that he was planning to leave New York.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.2
``I am sorry,'' he said.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.3
``No Answer.''
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.4
``No comment at all.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.5
This is my last word to you,'' he told hordes of journalists who chased him Thursday at his New York residence and U.N. headquarters seeking comment on his talks with the secretary-general, his future and the war.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.6
Asked who should govern Iraq, Al-Douri said: ``I have nothing to do with that.''
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.7
Annan also declined to comment on Thursday's meeting with Al-Douri.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.8
With the fall of Baghdad Wednesday, Al-Douri declared ``the game is over'' and expressed hope that the Iraqi people will now be able to live in peace.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.9
He said he had not been in touch with Baghdad.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.10
Beside meeting with Annan, Al-Douri spent several hours during the late morning and afternoon meeting with ambassadors and diplomats in the Delegate's Lounge.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.11
``I wished him good luck but I don't know what he said to the secretary-general and what will be his next steps,'' said Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa, who talked with Al-Douri before his own meeting with Annan.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.12
In an interview with The Associated Press Wednesday night, Al-Douri said he will continue to work at the United Nations and had no intention of defecting.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.13
``Defecting from who?'' he asked.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.14
``I think the government has already defected.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.15
There is no more Iraqi government to be defected from.''
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.16
Annan said early Thursday -- before meeting Al-Douri -- that in talks with the envoy Monday, ``he didn't ask for an asylum or protection ... (and) he didn't ask me for help with his status.''
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.17
``We did talk about what happens, depending on the evolution of things on the ground,'' Annan said.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.18
The ambassador had vehemently defended his country for months as the United States and its allies sought U.N. backing for war on Iraq.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.19
Privately, many U.N. diplomats see him as a respectable colleague.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.20
``I sympathize with his need to create a new life for himself,'' said Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.21
Al-Douri taught international law at Baghdad University for over 30 years before becoming a diplomat in 1999, first at the United Nations in Geneva and since early 2001 at U.N. headquarters in New York.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.22
He said in the AP interview he would love to return to teaching but for now he plans to remain at the United Nations.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.23
``Things will be crystalized one day,'' he said.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.24
``What I worried about is that things are settled in the country ... so in the future the Iraqi people will live in peace without sanctions, without wars, without suffering.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.25
This is my message.''
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.26
Separately, lawyers who claim that Iraq helped plan the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people asked a judge at a federal court in New York to force Al-Douri to testify in the case and hold the envoy in contempt, saying they worry that he would flee the country.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.27
But U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Al-Douri still has diplomatic immunity as Iraq's ambassador.
NW_APW_ENG_0059_2003_0410.28
Under U.N. rules, a new Iraqi government would have to ask to represent the country, which the General Assembly would then consider.

Larry Klayman, chairman of Judicial Watch, which represent 14 survivors and victims' relatives who have filed a $1.5 billion federal lawsuit against Iraq in Washington, said his organization had served a subpoena on Al-Douri twice, on March 26 and March 28, but said he has not responded.

Both are geographically sprawling with massive multiethnic populations.

Both are struggling to preserve national unity as they fight separatism and build democracy after the collapse of decades of authoritarian rule.

Both are resource-rich, but face huge economic problems made worse by endemic corruption.

Close ties between Moscow and Jakarta are not unprecedented.

Indonesia relied on Soviet military assistance in the 1950s under Megawati's father and founding President Sukarno, but these were severed after the anti-communist Gen. Suharto seized power in 1965.

In 1991, however, the U.S. Congress banned this after Indonesian troops killed hundreds of civilians in East Timor.
NW_APW_ENG_0060_2003_0412.22
In 1999, East Timor became free, but only after Indonesian forces laid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro-independence referendum.
NW_APW_ENG_0060_2003_0412.23
The shocking level of destruction prompted U.S. lawmakers to expand the ban to cover almost all military ties with Indonesia.
NW_APW_ENG_0060_2003_0412.24
Since then some in the Bush administration -- particularly Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, a former ambassador to Jakarta and a prime architect of the Iraq war -- have pushed for the ban to be repealed.
NW_APW_ENG_0060_2003_0412.25
So far, U.S. lawmakers have reinstated only a limited officer training program.

Currently, Indonesia uses short-range Rapier missiles purchased 30 years ago to protect its vital oil and natural gas fields in Sumatra, Borneo and Papua from air attack.

``Replenishing them has been a big problem,'' Sudarsono said.
NW_APW_ENG_0060_2003_0412.33
Air defense commanders want to augment the Rapiers with Russia's impressive long-range S-300 missiles, or shorter-range systems such as the SA-15 Gauntlet or shoulder-fired Igla.

The Air Force is reportedly considering purchasing several squadrons of Sukhoi Su-27 interceptors, considered the world's premier dogfighters.

Previously, Indonesian Air Force commanders preferred Western jets that were compatible with the U.S.-made F-16 fighter-bombers already in the Indonesian inventory.

But neighboring Malaysia's success in integrating Russian MiG-29s and American F/A-18 Hornets persuaded them otherwise, Sudarsono said.

If Megawati does stiff-arm the United States on the weapons issue, it is unlikely relations with Washington will be permanently damaged.

Whatever happens, Indonesia, a mainly Muslim but politically secular state, is natural ally in the struggle against terrorism and religious militancy.

What could be more worrying for Washington is Russia's economic ambitions.

``Iraq needs an Iraqi interim government.

U.S. officials hope more Iraqis join the process and stressed that this was just the first of many such meetings in Iraq.

A national conference is planned to select the interim administration, perhaps within weeks, a senior U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
NW_APW_ENG_0061_2003_0415.20
The interim administration could begin handing power back to Iraqi officials within three to six months, but forming a government will take longer, said Maj. Gen. Tim Cross, the top British member of Garner's team.
NW_APW_ENG_0061_2003_0415.21
``One has to go through the process of building from the bottom up, allowing the leadership to establish itself, and then the election process to go through and so forth,'' Cross said.

``That full electoral process may well take longer.''

Garner's Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance is charged with coordinating humanitarian assistance, rebuilding infrastructure shattered by years of war and U.N. sanctions, and gradually handing back power to Iraqis leading a democratically elected government.

Iraqi exile Hatem Mukhliss quoted President John F. Kennedy's exhortation, ``Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country,'' and called on Iraqis to write a constitution, establish a legal system and consider what role the army should play.

He asked coalition representatives to address problems of security, electricity and water in Iraq and help rebuild destroyed and looted hospitals.

``Saddam reduced the country to such a state that it was necessary for people to sell off personal possessions,'' Mukhliss said.
NW_APW_ENG_0061_2003_0415.30
``Now it's time to take our country back.''

There are already tensions between the United States and some Iraqi factions.

Kurdish groups appear unwilling to compromise on their demand to expand the border of their autonomous area to include the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and Kurdish parts of the city of Mosul.
NW_APW_ENG_0061_2003_0415.33
That could pose a problem for the United States, because Turkey worries that Kurdish control of Kirkuk could lead to aspirations for independence and in turn encourage separatist Kurds in Turkey.

Iraqi opposition leaders fear the United States is trying to force Ahmed Chalabi, head of the London-based umbrella Iraqi National Congress, on them as leader of a new Iraqi administration.
NW_APW_ENG_0061_2003_0415.35
Chalabi was the first top Iraqi opposition leader to be airlifted by the U.S. military into southern Iraq as the fighting wound down, and he and other top members of his group plan to meet soon in Baghdad.
NW_APW_ENG_0061_2003_0415.36
U.S. officials said Chalabi was brought in because he offered forces to the coalition.
NW_APW_ENG_0061_2003_0415.37
Neither Chalabi nor many other leaders of anti-Saddam groups attended Tuesday's meeting, but they sent delegates.
NW_APW_ENG_0061_2003_0415.38
Iraqis protesting the conference said it did not represent their interests.
NW_APW_ENG_0061_2003_0415.39
The protesters held banners written in English and Arabic saying the ``Hawza,'' or the Shiite religious seminary in Najaf, represents them.
NW_APW_ENG_0061_2003_0415.40
Even some of those at the meeting said they did not want Garner leading the interim administration.
NW_APW_ENG_0061_2003_0415.41
``We will press for any Iraqi civilian administration regardless of what the Americans say.
NW_APW_ENG_0061_2003_0415.42
An administration by Garner is not acceptable,'' said Mowaffak al-Rubaie, an Iraqi physician and opposition activist.

He said American officials have outlined what Garner's administration would look like: Each ministry would be headed by an American, either military or civilian.
NW_APW_ENG_0061_2003_0415.44
Each minister would have two American deputies and eight American advisers, plus four Iraqi advisers from inside the country and four Iraqi exiles.

The lawyer for a Russian military journalist convicted of treason filed an appeal Wednesday in an effort to overturn the guilty verdict against his client, who was released on parole earlier this year, news agencies reported.
NW_APW_ENG_0062_2003_0416.2
Grigory Pasko's lawyer Genri Reznik filed the appeal with Russian Supreme Court, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies reported.
NW_APW_ENG_0062_2003_0416.3
He asked the court to invalidate the verdict and throw out the criminal case against Pasko, they said.
NW_APW_ENG_0062_2003_0416.4
Pasko was sentenced to four years in prison in December 2001 for illegally attending a meeting of top military commanders and taking notes there.
NW_APW_ENG_0062_2003_0416.5
A military court said he intended to pass the notes to Japanese media with which he had worked.
NW_APW_ENG_0062_2003_0416.6
Pasko, whose sentence included time served, was released in January for good behavior after serving more than two-thirds of the sentence.
NW_APW_ENG_0062_2003_0416.7
He has maintained his innocence, saying the military was punishing him for exposing environmental abuses by the Russian navy, including the dumping of radioactive waste into the sea.
NW_APW_ENG_0062_2003_0416.8
Reznik said an initial appeal he lodged the day Pasko was freed never reached the presidium of the Supreme Court, according to Interfax.
NW_APW_ENG_0062_2003_0416.9
The lawyer said the court's military board had refused to launch proceedings on the appeal.
NW_APW_ENG_0062_2003_0416.10
Reznik said he addressed the new appeal directly to Supreme Court Chairman Vyacheslav Lebedev and asked that it not be considered by military judges ``because the military justice system has adopted a biased attitude against Pasko,'' Interfax reported.

The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia said Tuesday that the U.S. government won't be involved in choosing subcontractors for American companies named to help rebuild Iraq.
NW_APW_ENG_0063_2003_0422.2
``The way it works is that there have been an initial set of contracts let to US companies, since it's U.S. money.
NW_APW_ENG_0063_2003_0422.3
Those companies can subcontract to any company they want,'' Elizabeth Jones said.
NW_APW_ENG_0063_2003_0422.4
She made the statements after a meeting with the speaker of the Portuguese parliament, Joao Mota Amaral.
NW_APW_ENG_0063_2003_0422.5
``The U.S. government has done what it is going to do: it has opened up the process to international companies.
NW_APW_ENG_0063_2003_0422.6
We can't direct commerce,'' Jones said.
NW_APW_ENG_0063_2003_0422.7
``Once it's a commercial proposition, then international bidding processes come into effect.''

Rudolph Giuliani will wed his companion, Judith Nathan, on May 24 in the ex-mayor's old home, Gracie Mansion.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.2
The news was announced Thursday by Giuliani spokeswoman Sunny Mindel.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.3
His successor, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, will perform the ceremony.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.4
Giuliani, 58, proposed to Nathan, a former nurse, during a November business trip to Paris -- five months after he finalized his divorce from Donna Hanover after 20 years of marriage.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.5
In interviews last year, Giuliani said Nathan gave him ``tremendous emotional support'' through his treatment for prostate cancer and as he led the city during the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.6
``We were close already,'' Giuliani said.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.7
``And then we went through hell together.''
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.8
Giuliani and Nathan began appearing in public together in May 2000.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.9
Soon after, he announced that he and Hanover were moving toward legal separation.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.10
During the legal proceedings leading up to the divorce, a judge ruled that Nathan could not visit Gracie Mansion, the official mayoral residence, as long as Giuliani's children lived there.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.11
Giuliani and Hanover have two teenage children, Andrew and Caroline.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.12
The divorce settlement called for Giuliani to pay Hanover more than $6.8 million.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.13
Hanover, 53, is host of a syndicated television show, ``Famous Homes and Hideaways.''

Last month, she and her fiance -- an old high school sweetheart -- invited the press along as they went shopping for wedding bands, saying they are planning a wedding in the New York City area this summer.

Giuliani's first marriage to his second cousin, Regina Peruggi, lasted about 14 years.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.16
It was annulled by the Catholic Church because the couple had not obtained a church dispensation required when second cousins marry.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.17
Nathan divorced wallpaper salesman Bruce Nathan in 1992.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.18
They have a teenage daughter.

The Giuliani-Nathan nuptials will be a first for Bloomberg, who is making an exception from his policy of not performing weddings, said Bloomberg spokesman Ed Skyler.
NW_APW_ENG_0064_2003_0424.20
Giuliani regularly officiated at weddings while in office.

``The mayor is honored by their request,'' Skyler said.

The United States and Britain are preparing a resolution that would give the United Nations a role in humanitarian relief but not peacekeeping in Iraq, a senior official in U.S. President George W. Bush's administration said Friday.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.2
Separately, the United States has decided to divide the military and humanitarian relief mission in Iraq into three parts under American, British and Polish command, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.3
Six European countries have agreed to contribute troops to the British and Polish sectors to create an international stability force, the official said.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.4
The draft resolution would limit the U.N. role to helping with refugees and displaced people, reconstruction and humanitarian assistance, the official said.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.5
The United States and Britain agree on all but a few of the fine details of the resolution, the official said, though there is no timetable on when it would be introduced.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.6
U.N. officials are already in Iraq providing humanitarian relief.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.7
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said this week that the body has no interest in policing a postwar Iraq, although it could contribute to the political resuscitation of the country.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.8
``Take the question of security.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.9
I don't think the U.N. would want to take on that,'' Annan said.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.10
``There has been a suggestion that the U.N. wanted to take over the whole Iraq and run it, which was also not the case.''
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.11
What the United Nations could contribute beyond humanitarian assistance was ``political facilitation,'' Annan said.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.12
The proposed draft resolution would probably face resistance from other U.N. Security Council members who have favored a U.N.-convened conference of the kind that helped establish Afghanistan's post-Taliban government.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.13
U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld discussed the resolution with Prime Minister Tony Blair and Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon on Friday as Rumsfeld returned from a tour of Iraq, Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf region.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.14
Rumsfeld said afterward he hoped the U.N. would play a role but did not publicly discuss the draft resolution outlining that role.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.15
Hoon, who joined Rumsfeld in a news conference at Heathrow airport, also did not mention the draft resolution.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.16
``We are right to be optimistic about the way forward'' in Iraq, Hoon said.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.17
International stability forces will be sent to Iraq as soon as possible, the U.S. official said, though it was unclear when that would be.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.18
Those troops will work to restore and maintain order and supervise humanitarian projects such as the restoration of water and electricity and delivery of food and medical aid.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.19
The six nations contributing troops are Italy, Spain, Ukraine, Denmark, the Netherlands and Bulgaria, the official said.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.20
Representatives of those countries will meet with British officials May 7 and Polish officials May 22 to determine what forces each country will contribute and whether they will be put under British or Polish command.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.21
The U.S. part of the stability force will be comprised of American troops.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.22
While that portion is likely to consist of a military division -- about 20,000 -- the troop strength of the other two sectors has yet to be determined, the official said.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.23
The international stabilization force would be under the U.S. war commander, Gen. Tommy Franks.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.24
At least initially, the coalition stability forces will augment rather than replace the 135,000 American troops inside Iraq, the official said.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.25
The stability forces will focus on providing security and humanitarian relief while other U.S. troops focus on rooting out leftover members of Saddam Hussein's government and other armed elements in Iraq.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.26
Rumsfeld said, however, that the more troops other countries contribute to the stability effort, the fewer U.S. troops will be needed inside Iraq.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.27
Planning for both the U.N. resolution and the international security force left out France, Germany and Russia, three U.S. allies that vehemently opposed the war in Iraq.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.28
Some of the NATO members who agreed to send troops may want NATO authorization for that action, the official said.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.29
Requests for such authorization will be routed through the alliance's defense planning committee, which does not include France, the official said.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.30
The outlines for the international stability force were decided at a conference Hoon hosted Wednesday with representatives from 16 countries, mostly NATO members.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.31
Other countries including the Philippines, South Korea, Qatar and Australia agreed to send other help such as field hospitals, engineers, explosive ordnance disposal teams or nuclear, biological and chemical weapons experts.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.32
The U.S., British and Polish sectors will be drawn to take into account ethnic, religious, tribal and political factions within Iraq, the official said.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.33
For example, although ethnic Kurds are the majority in large parts of northern Iraq, there are also large numbers of Kurds within Baghdad.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.34
Some Arab countries also want to play a role in the stability operation in Iraq but are reluctant to send troops because of political, religious and ethnic considerations, the official said.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.35
Countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council have offered to donate money for the effort.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.36
Rumsfeld also met Friday with King Abdullah of Jordan, an American ally in the Middle East.
NW_APW_ENG_0065_2003_0502.37
Defense officials say Jordan provided key help in the Iraq war, acting as a staging area for U.S. special operations raids into western Iraq to prevent missiles from being fired at Jordan or Israel.

Rumsfeld did not say what the two discussed.

North Korea's military may have fired a laser at a U.S. helicopter in March, a U.S. official said Tuesday, as the communist state ditched its last legal obligation to keep itself free of nuclear weapons.
NW_APW_ENG_0067_2003_0513.2
The aircraft's censors detected the unknown type of laser while it was flying near the heavily fortified frontier that divides the two Koreas, the U.S. military official said on condition of anonymity.

No one was injured and no equipment was damaged in the incident.
NW_APW_ENG_0067_2003_0513.4
North Korea said Tuesday that a 1992 agreement with South Korea not to deploy nuclear arms on the Korean Peninsula was nullified, accusing the United States of derailing the deal.
NW_APW_ENG_0067_2003_0513.5
``The inter-Korean declaration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was thus reduced to a dead document due to the U.S. vicious hostile policy to stifle the DPRK with nukes,'' said the North's official news agency, KCNA.
NW_APW_ENG_0067_2003_0513.6
DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name.
NW_APW_ENG_0067_2003_0513.7
The announcement came as U.S. President George W. Bush and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun were about to meet Wednesday in Washington to discuss North Korea's nuclear programs.

The accord was the last remaining legal obligation under which North Korea was banned from developing atomic arms.

A U.S. military official in Seoul, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday North Korea is believed to have exported US$580 million worth of missiles to Iran, Pakistan, Libya, Syria, Egypt, Yemen and the United Arab Emirates in 2001.

North Korea accuses the United States of planning to attack the communist country, which Bush has branded part of an ``axis of evil'' along with Iran and Iraq.
NW_APW_ENG_0067_2003_0513.13
It also revived its claim that the U.S. military keeps many nuclear weapons in South Korea, turning the country into ``the biggest nuclear advance base in the Far East.''
NW_APW_ENG_0067_2003_0513.14
Washington says it wants to use dialogue to resolve the nuclear crisis, although U.S. officials have not ruled out a military option.
NW_APW_ENG_0067_2003_0513.15
North Korea ``keenly felt that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would only remain as a daydream unless the U.S. drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK,'' KCNA said.
NW_APW_ENG_0067_2003_0513.16
It said the U.S. invasion of Iraq taught it that ``a war can be averted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation can be protected only when a country has ... a strong military deterrent force capable of decisively repelling any attack to be made by any types of sophisticated weapons.''
NW_APW_ENG_0067_2003_0513.17
In New York, South Korean President Roh said he will never condone North Korea's nuclear development, but Seoul and Washington agree the nuclear standoff with the North must be solved peacefully ``by all means.''
NW_APW_ENG_0067_2003_0513.18
``It is incumbent upon Pyongyang to give up its nuclear project and come forward as a responsible member of the international community,'' he said.
NW_APW_ENG_0067_2003_0513.19
``When the North takes this route, the Republic of Korea and the international community will extend the necessary support and cooperation.''
NW_APW_ENG_0067_2003_0513.20
Julianne Lee, a Roh spokeswoman, said the North Korean statement might be a negotiating ploy in the wake of talks last month with U.S. officials in Beijing.
NW_APW_ENG_0067_2003_0513.21
During the talks in Beijing, U.S. officials said North Korea claimed it already possesses nuclear weapons, and that it had reprocessed 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods -- a move that could yield several atomic bombs within months.

The shootings -- which the Israeli army said came in response to attacks by Palestinians throwing stones and molotov cocktails -- came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon declared that Israel's occupation in the West Bank must end, stunning both dovish opponents and hardline allies.

Military sources said the Israeli army had established roadblocks at the entrance to Beit Hanoun to prevent Palestinians militants from leaving the area.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.23
The sources said shots had been fired in the air when vehicles tried to skirt the roadblocks.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.24
The violence erupted after Sharon endured withering criticism Monday from members of his own Likud Party over his Cabinet's acceptance of the U.S.-backed ``road map'' peace plan.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.25
Sharon indicated a 180-degree turnaround after decades of warning that an Israeli withdrawal from even small parts of the West Bank could endanger Israel's existence.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.26
Skeptics, however, wondered whether Sharon's conversion was a shrewd effort to deflect U.S. pressure in the hopes the road map would fail before Israel had to make tough concessions.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.27
``To keep 3.5 million people under occupation is bad for us and them,'' Sharon said in remarks broadcast on Israel Radio.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.28
The term ``occupation'' is anathema to the Israeli right, which believes Israel has a legitimate claim to the West Bank and Gaza Strip for religious and security reasons.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.29
Palestinians and their dovish Israeli allies routinely use the word ``occupation'' when demanding that Israel leave the West Bank and Gaza and dismantle Jewish settlements.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.30
Palestinians claim all of the West Bank and Gaza for a state.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.31
On Sunday, Sharon's Cabinet conditionally approved the ``road map,'' a three-phase plan that begins with a halt to violence and envisages a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 2005.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.32
Sharon told party critics he was committed to finding a political solution to the conflict, including an Israeli withdrawal from West Bank population centers.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.33
``This can't continue endlessly.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.34
Do you want to remain forever in Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus?'' he asked.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.35
Likud lawmakers charged that the road map was slanted in favor of the Palestinians and endangers Israel.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.36
In his remarks Monday, Sharon left himself an out.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.37
``What will happen if Palestinian terror continues?
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.38
Nothing.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.39
Nothing will happen.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.40
The Palestinians will get nothing,'' he said.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.41
Critics have said Sharon's long-held condition that all violence must stop before peace moves is unrealistic and guarantees failure of any peace initiative, including the road map, thus releasing him from the necessity of following through on his remarks.
NW_APW_ENG_0069_2003_0527.42
Liberal lawmaker Yossi Sarid argued Sharon was trying to keep his intentions murky to persuade the U.S. government that he was committed to the plan, while his hawkish allies could assume he was just making a tactical move to end U.S. pressure.

Indian call center sets up hot line for Hurricane Rita victims

GANDHINAGAR, India
NW_APW_ENG_0074_2005_0929.3
Until last week, Madhavi Patel came to work each evening at a call center in western India, put on her headset and an American accent and spent the night taking calls from Americans about their credit cards.
NW_APW_ENG_0074_2005_0929.4
Then, Hurricane Rita happened.
NW_APW_ENG_0074_2005_0929.5
The call center, run by Effective Teleservices of Lufkin, Texas, set up a hot line for victims of the hurricane, and 23-three-old Patel and more than 240 of her colleagues began long days and nights fielding thousands of calls from frantic and scared people affected by the storm half a world away.
NW_APW_ENG_0074_2005_0929.6
Employees at the call center in Gandhinagar, capital of India's western Gujarat state, provide Texas residents with information about relief operations, where to get food and gasoline and find shelter, said Jim Iyoob, the center's director and a one-time resident of Texas.
NW_APW_ENG_0074_2005_0929.7
"We have been handling on an average 20 to 25 calls every hour," Iyoob, an American, told The Associated Press this week, adding that some employees manning the hot line hadn't gone home in days.
NW_APW_ENG_0074_2005_0929.8
One call came from a couple that had driven with their children for about 100 kilometers (60 miles) to flee the hurricane, but ran out of gasoline and were stuck for six hours.
NW_APW_ENG_0074_2005_0929.9
The hot line directed them to a gas station 1 1/2 kilometers (about a mile) away, Iyoob said.
NW_APW_ENG_0074_2005_0929.10
The couple later called back to say thanks, he said.

Hundreds of Western companies have in recent years cut costs by farming out software development, engineering design and call center work to countries where workers are paid considerably less than their counterparts in the United States and Europe.
NW_APW_ENG_0074_2005_0929.12
India is the undisputed king of the business with more than 40 percent of the outsourced work _ sowing resentment among critics in the United States and Western Europe who feel that jobs that could have gone to fellow citizens have been taken by underpaid Indians.
NW_APW_ENG_0074_2005_0929.13
The hot line could earn public relations points for Indian call centers, but Patel said the idea of helping others was more important.
NW_APW_ENG_0074_2005_0929.14
"We have taken up the responsibility to save people's lives but we are not here to see our names printed in newspapers," she said. Iyoob, a board member of Effective Teleservices, said employees were given two hours of training before the hot line was opened.
NW_APW_ENG_0074_2005_0929.15
"Years back, I used to live in Texas and never thought that being in Gujarat in India, I would be able to give it something in return," he said. Iyoob said a friend, a retired Texas judge, called him last week and asked him to start the hot line in India, because the company's two call centers in Texas had been temporarily shut down.
NW_APW_ENG_0074_2005_0929.16
Authorities then publicized the telephone number, Iyoob said.
NW_APW_ENG_0074_2005_0929.17
Effective Teleservices is bearing all costs of the hot line, he said. Iyoob said he could not give names of callers or transcripts of conversations as it was against call centers' policy.

Arindam Mukhopadhyay, 22, said he spent his entire weekend at the 500-seat call center and was glad to help those in need.

"It was an absolute team effort and I am happy that I was part of it," Mukhopadhyay said.

A change in weather allowed rescuers to step up their search for several French and Nepalese mountaineers, believed dead after they were swept away by an avalanche on a Himalayan peak last month, rescuers said Thursday.
NW_APW_ENG_0075_2005_1103.4
Four French rescuers, 25 Nepalese sherpas and two rescue dogs from France have been combing the slopes of Mount Kang Guru in northwestern Nepal where the seven French and 11 Nepalese climbers were buried by a wall of snow on Oct. 19.
NW_APW_ENG_0075_2005_1103.5
So far only the bodies of two French climbers have been recovered, and rescuers said that some of the bodies may stay hidden until the snow clears in the spring.
NW_APW_ENG_0075_2005_1103.6
"It is like searching for needles in a hay stack.
NW_APW_ENG_0075_2005_1103.7
We have a lot of ground to cover," said Koenig Serge, a rescue expert who flew in from France to help with the search.
NW_APW_ENG_0075_2005_1103.8
Bad weather had delayed the initial search operation and the first rescue team only reached the base camp of the 6,981-meter-(22,900-foot-) high peak by helicopter four days after the avalanche.
NW_APW_ENG_0075_2005_1103.9
Snow scattered by the avalanche had also made it dangerous for the rescuers to move around.
NW_APW_ENG_0075_2005_1103.10
Serge said rescuers were focusing their search in an area where the dogs had picked up a scent late Wednesday, when the weather cleared and the snow began to settle.
NW_APW_ENG_0075_2005_1103.11
The rescuers have camped at Meta, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of the Nepalese capital, Katmandu, and plan to continue their search for few more days, he said.

Hundreds of firefighters battled wildfires across southeastern Australia on Wednesday as high temperatures and strong winds fanned grass and forest fires into infernos.
NW_APW_ENG_0076_2006_1122.4
No houses were destroyed, though fires came within a few hundred yards (meters) of homes, the fire service said.
NW_APW_ENG_0076_2006_1122.5
One man died when he accidentally set fire to dry grass Tuesday while tending a beehive with a smoke machine and became entangled in a fence, but his death was not related to the wildfires, New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner Phil Koperberg said.
NW_APW_ENG_0076_2006_1122.6
Scores of fires were burning across the states of NSW, Victoria and South Australia as hot dry weather made conditions conducive for brush fires, a common annual occurrence in Australia between November and February.
NW_APW_ENG_0076_2006_1122.7
In the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, temperatures reached above 36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees Fahrenheit) and winds gusted at 100 kph (62 mph), fanning fires in thickly wooded but uninhabited gorges.
NW_APW_ENG_0076_2006_1122.8
A weather change late Wednesday brought cooler temperatures but continuing blustery winds.
NW_APW_ENG_0076_2006_1122.9
At the height of the danger Wednesday, more than 200 firefighters were deployed to reinforce hundreds already spread throughout the Blue Mountains while helicopters dumped payloads of water on the fires.
NW_APW_ENG_0076_2006_1122.10
NSW Rural Fire Service spokeswoman Rebel Talbot said flames at one site flared so high they jumped up a cliff face about 20 meters (65 feet) high.
NW_APW_ENG_0076_2006_1122.11
The fires burned mostly in areas inaccessible to fire trucks, leaving firefighters to take containment measures and setting up to protect homes, but unable to battle the fires head-on.
NW_APW_ENG_0076_2006_1122.12
Weather forecasters said the hot conditions would continue until next week, and Koperberg said the situation would remain dangerous.
NW_APW_ENG_0076_2006_1122.13
"The next two to three weeks are going to be fairly intensive in terms of attempting to contain these fires," he said.

Fifty people who were missing after a tornado hit this Texas Panhandle town have been located and appear to be safe, an official said Monday.

Moore County Judge Rowdy Rhoades said the 50 residents likely evacuated after hearing tornado sirens.

Critics say India negligent in preparing for floods
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.2
NEW DELHI 2007-08-08 14:45:13 UTC
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.3
Each year, the monsoon clouds roll across South Asia and the killer floods follow.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.4
With this year's flooding especially calamitous in India -- more than a 1,200 people have been killed and millions forced from their homes -- experts are blaming the government for failing to strengthen embankments, build needed dams and come up with evacuation plans.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.5
They point to neighboring Bangladesh, where years of preparations helped reduce the scope of this year's suffering.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.6
After devastating floods in 1998 killed 2,379 people and left three quarters of Bangladesh, including the capital, Dhaka, under water, officials took action.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.7
Flood walls were built around Dhaka and a network of mud embankments erected to protect villages.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.8
A permanent flood warning center was set up to issue regular bulletins informing people about the water level in the rivers.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.9
This year's flooding still killed 192 people in Bangladesh.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.10
But experts say it could have been worse, noting that a new pilot system to help forecast floods gave thousands of people time to evacuate.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.11
"Our goal is that long-range flood forecasts, for the first time, will consistently reach many rural individuals in Bangladesh who are in jeopardy of losing their homes, businesses, and possibly their lives," said Thomas Hopson, a scientist with the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research, which helped devise the system.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.12
No such system exists in India, where a broad swath of fertile land stretching along the southern edge of the Himalayas was inundated, displacing an 19 million people in this country of 1.1 billion.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.13
With the waters finally receding, the recriminations are rising.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.14
"This calamity is the result of the state government's callousness and the extensive damage shows criminal neglect on its part," said Rabri Devi, the head of the opposition in Bihar, an eastern state that was hardest hit in large part because it was the least prepared.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.15
"Had the money been properly utilized, embankments in north Bihar would not have fallen like a pack of cards," she said.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.16
While her criticism may be politically motivated, evidence of neglect is rampant in this state notorious for its lack of basic infrastructure, corruption and poverty.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.17
"The magnitude of these floods shows how important it is for governments and the international community to be prepared when disasters strike," said Ashvin Dayal, head of Oxfam in South Asia.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.18
Officials agreed, saying that not enough embankments have been built to prevent rivers flooding; wells were not protected, allowing water sources to be contaminated, and no evacuation plans were in place.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.19
"There is a flurry of activities during floods and once the flood waters recede the department goes into deep slumber," said a senior official in the Bihar water resource management department, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.20
Similar situations exist in other Indian states affected by the floods.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.21
Federal Home Minister Shivraj Patil said the state governments were doing the best they could.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.22
"Tasks like these are always formidable.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.23
Whatever the state governments are doing is according to the circumstances.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.24
The more that is done, the better," he told reporters, while promising more money for disaster preparedness.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.25
But India's problem appears to be one of political will, not resources -- the country is much richer than Bangladesh, an impoverished nation of 150 million people that lies on the Ganges river delta and has been repeatedly ravaged by floods.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.26
In India it seems little has been learned from the current disaster or from its neighbor.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.27
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who toured the flooded areas by helicopter Tuesday asked the federal government for some 32 billion rupees (US$790 million; euro570 million) in assistance.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.28
Of that, nearly all was earmarked for compensation and reconstruction, with little for prevention.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.29
What little preventive steps have been taken have come from international aid groups like Oxfam and Catholic Relief Services, which have been working on a community level to prepare villages for the annual flooding.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.30
Working with local groups, they have mapped out villages to look for weak points, found places of refuge and set up rescue teams "so they can better prepare for the next time disaster comes," said Jennifer Poidatz, the head of CRS in India.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.31
But their efforts are on a small scale, she acknowledges, and to really make an impact the government needs to take greater steps.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.32
"Getting that larger commitment is critical," Poidatz said.
NW_APW_ENG_0078_2007_0808.33
"Systems exist on paper but implementation does not happen for various reasons," she said.

NW_APW_ENG_0079_2007_0813.3
India said it will resume air drops of food and other aid to flood victims in northern India on Monday, following violent riots over a lack of assistance.
NW_APW_ENG_0079_2007_0813.4
Devastating monsoon floods have laid waste to much of northern India and Bangladesh in recent weeks, killing more than 2,000 people and displacing millions.
NW_APW_ENG_0079_2007_0813.5
At least 34 more deaths were reported Monday in India.
NW_APW_ENG_0079_2007_0813.6
Meanwhile, the United Nations warned that Bangladesh could face acute food shortages as the floods destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares (acres) of crops.
NW_APW_ENG_0079_2007_0813.7
In the northern Indian state of Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar ordered government relief agencies to continue air drops of assistance to the worst-hit areas.
NW_APW_ENG_0079_2007_0813.8
The decision was prompted by violent riots in the town of Sonebarsa, where police killed one person and wounded four after hundreds of people ransacked a local relief office to protest the lack of aid.
NW_APW_ENG_0079_2007_0813.9
The government had earlier said it would end the air drops because land routes had been re-established to most of the flood-hit areas.
NW_APW_ENG_0079_2007_0813.10
Meanwhile, the U.N. World Food Program chief in Bangladesh, Douglas Broderick, said he feared the country could face a food crisis.
NW_APW_ENG_0079_2007_0813.11
"We are quite concerned over the significant damage to crops in the flood-affected areas," he told reporters late Sunday.
NW_APW_ENG_0079_2007_0813.12
According to Bangladesh's government, this year's monsoon floods destroyed crops on more than 242,800 hectares (600,000 acres) of land.
NW_APW_ENG_0079_2007_0813.13
Broderick said the WFP initially planned to distribute 1,500-2,000 tons of rice among the victims, and that as "needs increase, we would also increase the distribution."
NW_APW_ENG_0079_2007_0813.14
While most of the flood waters have subsided, thousands of people were still being treated across India and Bangladesh for diseases that affect people who drink from stagnant pools left behind by floodwaters, or from wells contaminated by waste that gets washed into them.
NW_APW_ENG_0079_2007_0813.15
More than 43,000 people were being treated for diarrhea in Bangladesh, said government health adviser Matiur Rahman.

More than 2,000 travelers were stranded at Red Cross shelters in the Colorado high country Monday as a threat of avalanches closed a stretch of a main highway west of Denver.
NW_APW_ENG_0080_2007_1231.4
Deep snow drifted into more than two dozen narrow ravines in the mountainsides -- known as avalanche chutes -- raising the danger of potentially deadly snow slides cascading onto Interstate-70.
NW_APW_ENG_0080_2007_1231.5
High winds and blowing snow forced the state to close the highway overnight.
NW_APW_ENG_0080_2007_1231.6
There was no word on when the busy thoroughfare through the mountains would reopen.
NW_APW_ENG_0080_2007_1231.7
Crews planned to use low-power explosives Monday morning trying to bring the snow down while the highway was closed, Mead said.
NW_APW_ENG_0080_2007_1231.8
In addition to the avalanche threat, wind-blown snow reduced visibility to nearly zero.
NW_APW_ENG_0080_2007_1231.9
At the 1.7-mile-long (2.7-kilometer-long) Eisenhower Tunnel about 40 miles (64.37 kilometers) west of Denver, wind gusts reached 70 mph (112.65 kilometers), keeping crews from clearing the avalanche chutes.
NW_APW_ENG_0080_2007_1231.10
Red Cross spokeswoman Melinda Epp said the agency opened seven shelters in schools and recreation centers and most of the 2,000-plus travelers who used them during the night were still there Monday morning.

Eastbound lanes were closed from Vail to Georgetown, about 60 miles (97 kilometers).

Tsunami-hit area where half died now faces malaria, local official warns
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.2
SUAK BEUKAH, Indonesia
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.3
Airdrops have provided enough food for the survivors, but in a region where half of the people were wiped out by the tsunami, officials now fear malaria could kill more if medical supplies don't arrive soon.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.4
The enormous Dec. 26 sea surge killed 1,294 people in a cluster of six villages on Sumatra island's west coast while 1,204 lived, Marzuki, a regional councilor said as he brought a count of the dead to the provincial capital Banda Aceh aboard an American Seahawk helicopter.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.5
"We have enough food now," he said as American and Indonesian troops unloaded sacks of rice and plastic bottles full of drinking water onto a field at the edge of Suak Beukah village, where many from the surrounding area are staying in temporary camps.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.6
"We need medicine."
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.7
He said malaria medication was badly needed, because some of those in the area had contracted the life-threatening mosquito-borne disease, although he did not specify the number of cases or whether they had been confirmed by foreign doctors.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.8
He gave no further details about the malaria in the area, but health experts fear malaria and another mosquito-borne disease, dengue fever, could kill 100,000 people in tsunami-hit areas of southern Asia.

Workers have been spraying insecticide to try to keep it in check.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.10
A World Health Organization spokesman, Bob Dietz, said that international aid workers have heard of 25 people suffering fever _ a symptom of malaria _ in the village of Kuala Bhee and have headed to the region with rapid diagnostic kits and supplies for taking blood samples.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.11
It was not immediately clear if Kuala Bhee was among the villages close to Suak Beukah.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.12
"If this is an outbreak, it would not be unusual for this time of year in this region," he said in a telephone interview.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.13
Officials say that malaria is common in Aceh at this time of year and due to the heightened state of alert caused by the huge influx of international aid agencies, more cases than normal may be recorded simply because there are more health experts in the region.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.14
About 150 people, many of them children, ran close to the chopper and smiled and waved at the crewmen as they pulled off 1,950 kilograms (4,300 pounds) of rice and 135 kilograms (300 pounds) of water in a five-minute stop after a 25-minute flight south from the provincial capital Banda Aceh.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.15
At a soccer field near Banda Aceh's airport, the hub of relief operations in stricken Aceh province, more than a dozen U.S. helicopters arrived over several hours to be loaded with food, water and aid workers being ferried to towns along the coast.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.16
Capt. Matt Klunder, Naval Air Wing 2 deputy commander, said the American helicopters were flying about 80 daily missions.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.17
He said the terrible desperation those delivering aid witnessed in the first days after the disaster, when villagers often mobbed helicopters as soon as they touched down, had largely abated.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.18
"Now there's a little more confidence because they know that on a somewhat regular basis we can get them foodstuffs and water," he said.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.19
But in the past week, he said, the missions had begun reaching survivors who had sheltered in the mountains after the tsunami and only recently felt safe enough to return to the flatter coast.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.20
Among that group, the needs are still great and conditions sometimes desperate, Klunder said.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.21
In Suak Beukah, little damage to houses or the local mosque was visible from the edge of town.
NW_APW_ENG_0202_2005_0119.22
The tsunami did not reach the village, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the shore but decimated its lower-lying neighbors, Marzuki said.

Specialists from Romanian's Water Company said water levels along the Danube would vary in the next few days, rising in some places and shrinking in others.
NW_APW_ENG_0203_2006_0425.14
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu told a news conference that the flooding had been caused by the large number of dikes were built along the Danube during the 1960s and 1970s, under communism, to reclaim land for agriculture.
NW_APW_ENG_0203_2006_0425.15
"Things which are against nature, and here I am referring to dikes along the Danube, are exactly the reason we are having flooding because the Danube cannot deal with the excessive flow," he said, adding there were plans to examine how the situation could be changed.
NW_APW_ENG_0203_2006_0425.16
Later Tuesday, authorities said 1,000 residents would be evacuated from the village of Chiselet in western Romania to a hill, said Jenel Serban, local government official to allow authorities a controlled flooding of the area to protect a nearby town.

Myanmar's Cyclone Nargis survivors still need help
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.2
THA GYAR HIN OH, Myanmar 2009-05-02 17:10:23 UTC
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.3
The monsoons are due any day now, and for the hundreds of villagers with fresh memories of last year's deadly Cyclone Nargis, an emergency shelter that opened Saturday was yet another reminder that their huts -- and their lives -- remain fragile.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.4
"How are we going to survive if another strong wind comes?" said Hla Thin, who clung to a coconut tree with her husband on May 2, 2008, when Nargis whipped through and wiped out their former home.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.5
"It was so dark and the sound of the water and wind was so terrifying.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.6
We heard people calling for help."
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.7
Nargis crashed into Myanmar's southwestern coast in the middle of the night, sweeping away entire farming villages and killing nearly 140,000 people, and 12 months on people in some of the hardest-hit and most isolated areas are still suffering.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.8
"We have no solutions and no help," said Hla Thin, 38-year-old a farmer, who used to scrape by on rice farming but now has no money to hire farm hands, no seeds for planting and expects to miss the planting season already under way.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.9
"My husband has contemplated suicide rather than face the difficulties ahead."
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.10
The cyclone churned for two days and sent tidal surges as high as 12 feet (3 1/2 meters) some 25 miles (40 kilometers) inland.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.11
It was the worst natural disaster Myanmar has ever seen and one of the deadliest in recorded history.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.12
Most of the dead were in the low-lying Irrawaddy delta, the country's once-fertile rice-growing region on the southwestern coast, where tens of thousands of farm families sleeping in rickety shacks barely above sea level were swept to their deaths.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.13
The sea water that surged through the region inundated water wells and many survivors still lack clean drinking water.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.14
The waves also turned almost 2 million acres (800,000 hectares) of Myanmar's most fertile rice paddies into salt-contaminated wastelands.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.15
Humanitarian agencies say 90 percent of the survivors have been provided with food, clean drinking water and basic shelter needs.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.16
But hundreds of thousands remain without decent jobs and proper housing, leaving them vulnerable to the coming monsoon rains and little to lift them out of poverty.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.17
"Shelter is probably the number one challenge or difficulty faced by hundreds of thousands of families across the delta," said Paul Risley, a spokesman for the U.N.'s World Food Program, which expects to provide food rations for the rest of the year to at least 350,000 survivors.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.18
The Thin family was among the hundreds who attended the opening of the delta's first cyclone shelter Saturday in the village of Tha Gyar Hin Oh, at the mouth of the Pyapone river, which opens into the Bay of Bengal.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.19
The shelter, sponsored by private donors, can hold 1,500 people including several surrounding villages.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.20
Like many parts of the delta, their village is accessible only by boat.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.21
Residents say they received food and other assistance after the cyclone but that it stopped coming months ago and they desperately need more.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.22
Foreign governments and charities provided $315 million for food aid and emergency assistance in the months after the storm.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.23
But aid agencies say hundreds of millions of dollars more are still needed to rebuild the delta's severely damaged infrastructure and help farmers rebuild their lives.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.24
Thaung Ko, a 37-year-old laborer from a nearby village, says he can't find work, which means his family doesn't eat very often.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.25
"Before the cyclone we could eat at least two meals a day," he said.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.26
"Now sometimes we eat once around 2 p.m."
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.27
Myanmar's secretive military regime denied foreign aid agencies access to the delta in the initial weeks that followed the disaster, but relented after global condemnation.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.28
Yet the junta punished civilians, especially pro-democracy activists, who rushed to provide aid without the military's permission.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.29
At least 21 people remain imprisoned for providing cyclone aid and "shining a spotlight on government indifference to Cyclone Nargis survivors," Human Rights Watch said in a statement Friday.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.30
They are serving prison terms ranging from two to 35 years.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.31
People across Myanmar marked the storm's one-year anniversary with quiet remembrance and prayer, but the junta held no official ceremonies to commemorate the disaster.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.32
The state-controlled New Light of Myanmar newspaper did not mention the cyclone in its 16-page edition Saturday.
NW_APW_ENG_0204_2009_0502.33
"My sister and brother died saving my parents, and my life without them is never the same," said Hlaing Bwa, a 34-year-old fisherman, who lives in Thaunglay village in Haing Gyi island where the cyclone first made landfall before pummeling the mainland.

Taipei, May 16 (CNA)
NW_CNA_ENG_0205_2008_0516.3
Taiwan continued its efforts Friday to provide humanitarian aid, not only to the victims of China's devastating earthquake, but also to Taiwanese tourists trapped by the quake in Sichuan Province.
NW_CNA_ENG_0205_2008_0516.4
According to Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chen Ming-tong, the first humanitarian relief charter flight operated by the Taiwan-based TransAsia Airways is expected to depart from Chongqing in Sichuan Friday evening and is scheduled arrive in Taiwan at 11:10 p.m. the same day carrying Taiwan citizens who had been stranded after the quake.
NW_CNA_ENG_0205_2008_0516.5
Meanwhile, two other charter flights operated by China Airlines (CAL) and EVA Airways will head for Sichuan late Friday to transport Taiwanese tourists home, Chen said at a farewell party held at the MAC.
NW_CNA_ENG_0205_2008_0516.6
Chen will leave office on May 20 when the incoming Kuomintang administration takes over.
NW_CNA_ENG_0205_2008_0516.7
The CAL and EVA flights are expected to return to Taiwan early Saturday morning, Chen said.
NW_CNA_ENG_0205_2008_0516.8
Noting that a total of NT$18.74 million (US$604,516) in donations had been paid into a special bank account set up by the MAC, Chen expressed appreciation on behalf of the Taiwan government for the love and sympathy shown by the Taiwan people.
NW_CNA_ENG_0205_2008_0516.9
Chen disclosed that China's semi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) had agreed to deliver the relief goods and funds through Taiwan and China's Red Cross Societies, but added that "a time frame has not yet been decided."
NW_CNA_ENG_0205_2008_0516.10
As for the 14 Taiwanese tourists still missing in the 7.9 magnitude earthquake, Chen said the MAC is trying to obtain more up-to-date information through Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).
NW_CNA_ENG_0205_2008_0516.11
In addition, a team of 22 Taiwanese rescuers departed for quake-devastated Sichuan Province in southwestern China Friday afternoon on a direct charter flight to China.
NW_CNA_ENG_0205_2008_0516.12
The team, consisting of 11 rescuers from both the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China and the Taipei City Fire Department and a rescue dog, is expected to operate in the disaster areas under the auspices of the Red Cross Society's Taiwan chapter.

NW_FLO_ENG_0104_2004_1113.15
-- Last year auditors discovered Arafat was guilty of skimming $2 million a month from the gasoline trade in the territories, TIME reports.
NW_FLO_ENG_0104_2004_1113.16
In August 2002 international donors forced Arafat to sign over his investments to the Palestine Investment Fund, which was audited by U.S. accountants and managed by Palestinian Finance Minister Salam Fayyad, a former International Monetary Fund official.
NW_FLO_ENG_0104_2004_1113.17
After scouring corporations throughout the Arab world and bank accounts in the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg, the auditors identified $800 million, which has been made a part of the Palestinian Authority's official budget.
NW_FLO_ENG_0104_2004_1113.18
It's the most successful financial reform in the Arab world, -- Jim Prince, president of the Los Angeles-based Democracy Council and head of the audit team, tells TIME.
NW_FLO_ENG_0104_2004_1113.19
People close to Fayyad's investigation told TIME of Arafat's skimming from the gas trade.
NW_FLO_ENG_0104_2004_1113.20
Breaking the gasoline smuggling and corruption boosted the Palestinian Authority's official treasury by $10 million a month and cut gas prices for ordinary Palestinians.

In the mid-1990s, Arafat controlled a financial empire worth at least $3 billion.

By the time of his death, he was down to his last $1 billion, according to Israeli-intelligence estimates.

Arafat wife Suha's outburst that his successors were "trying to bury [him] alive" came after she learned that Arafat had signed over at least $800 million to the government of the Palestinian Authority two years ago, TIME reports.
NW_FLO_ENG_0104_2004_1113.25
Top Palestinian officials say Suha wants the new chief of the P.L.O., Mahmoud Abbas, and Palestinian prime minister Ahmed Qurei to give her money out of the P.L.O.'s party coffers.
NW_FLO_ENG_0104_2004_1113.26
But a senior P.L.O. official tells TIME, "they'll pay her a pension, and that's it."
NW_FLO_ENG_0104_2004_1113.27
People familiar with Arafat's finances say the Palestinian leader sent Suha $200,000 a month out of the Palestinian Authority's budget for the Office of the President.
NW_FLO_ENG_0104_2004_1113.28
French authorities are investigating transfers of $15 million from Swiss banks to Paris accounts in Suha's name at the Arab Bank and at BNP Paribas Bank, a French bank, TIME reports.

There is now ... in an Israeli prison a man named Marwan Barghouti, who is one of the young guard of Palestinians, and if the Palestinians are going to make this work against the really hard-line elements, the Islamists and some of the people of Hamas, they're going to have to have a coalition of the young guard and the old guard.

On June 6, 2004, he was sentenced to five life sentences for five murders of Israeli civilians and 40 years imprisonment for attempted murders in terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians.
NW_FLO_ENG_0107_2004_1116.7
Barghouti was one of the major leaders of the First Intifada in 1987, leading Palestinians in a mass uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank.
NW_FLO_ENG_0107_2004_1116.8
During the uprising, he was arrested by Israel and deported to Jordan, where he stayed for seven years until he was permitted to return under the terms of the Oslo Accords in 1994.
NW_FLO_ENG_0107_2004_1116.9
In 1996, he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council, in which he advocated peace with Israel, sometimes coming in conflict with Yasser Arafat.
NW_FLO_ENG_0107_2004_1116.10
The formal position occupied by Barghouti was the General Secretary of Fatah in the West Bank.
NW_FLO_ENG_0107_2004_1116.11
By the summer of 2000, Barghouti and Arafat had grown increasingly at odds with each other, with Barghouti accusing Arafat's administration of corruption and his security services of human rights violations, and Arafat was planning to fire him shortly.
NW_FLO_ENG_0107_2004_1116.12
However, as the Second Intifada began, Barghouti became increasingly popular as a leader of the Fatah Tanzim militia.
NW_FLO_ENG_0107_2004_1116.13
This was perhaps due to the transformation of Tanzim into an organization more resembling militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, responsible for dozens of civilian deaths in drive-by shootings.
NW_FLO_ENG_0107_2004_1116.14
Under Barghouti, the Tanzim has also carried out suicide bombings in Israel under the name al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.
NW_FLO_ENG_0107_2004_1116.15
What is he thinking?
NW_FLO_ENG_0107_2004_1116.16
Release a known terrorist to run the PLO and that will bring about peace, give me a effin break.

Chris Matthews, that idiot talking head over at MSNBC, said yesterday about the terrorists we fought in Fallujah "a rival, I mean they're not bad guys especially, just people who just disagree with us".
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.2
...this just amazes me, the complete idiocy of this waste of human sperm.
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.3
These are the same terrorists blowing up families, chopping off heads of civilians, and the complete disregard for any human life and they just disagree with us?
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.4
Tell that to the family of Margaret Hassan, the school teacher who was brutally tortured and then slaughtered by these same guys, they ain't so bad are they Chris Matthews?

This women who was known for her 30 years of work in Iraq, distributing medicine, food and supplies to Iraqis suffering under the sanctions of the 1990s.
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.6
British officials say they believe Hassan was a blindfolded woman seen being shot in the head by a hooded militant on a video obtained but not aired by the Arab television station Al-Jazeera.
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.7
She would be the first foreign woman to die in the wave of kidnappings in Iraq.

No group has claimed responsibility.
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.9
On Sunday, Marines found the mutilated body of what they believe was a Western woman on a street in Fallujah during the U.S. assault on the insurgent stronghold.
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.10
The body, clothed in what appeared to be a purple, velour dress, was wrapped in a blanket, with a blood-soaked black cloth nearby.
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.11
As of Tuesday night, the U.S. command said the body had not been identified.
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.12
These are the reasons that none of these mothereffers should ever see the light of day.
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.13
..they need to be all lined up and shot.
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.14
Torturing this poor women for what?
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.15
WHAT?
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.16
And we should treat them as enemy soldiers under the Geneva Convention.
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.17
Last I remember the convention applies to countries that signed the document and the two countries must have standing armies with uniforms.
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.18
...the Iraqi military is at our side, the terrorists are not.
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.19

Finally there is this written by a student of Mrs. Hassan She was my English teacher.

In the memory of my teacher and a fellow aid worker colleague Mrs. M. Hassan.
NW_FLO_ENG_0108_2004_1117.23
Mrs. Hassan was my English teacher in The British Council in Baghdad in Al-Wazirya district, I remember her years ago with her Irish accent telling me it's not Important how many words I must learn but the pronunciation of the words I already knew must be perfected.

On Sunday he wrote of two Iraqi soldiers who didn't see us as conquerors but as allies when the Mosul bombing occurred.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.4
The suicide bomb sprayed bb-like fragments throughout the Marez dining facility.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.5
One piece of shrapnel sliced through the femoral artery of a U.S. soldier and his only chance for survival was in the hands of these two Iraqis.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.6
Recalling the medical classes they'd received from the special forces, the Iraqis reacted calmly, fastening a belt above the wound, creating a tourniquet, which stopped the gushing stream of red.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.7
They moved the soldier to a MEDVAC vehicle via two-man litter carry.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.8
After they hoisted the soldier in the truck, the two Iraqis -- one an officer, the other an NCO -- ran back to the facility and began treating the other wounded without regard for their safety.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.9
When the dust settled and the mess tent had been evacuated, everybody who could talk was questioned about their health.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.10
When the medics came to the two Iraqis, the ING soldiers only wanted to know how everybody else was.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.11
When asked why did they do it, they simply stated, "this was our duty; we are a team, and we take care of each other."
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.12
Even the Americans.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.13
No matter what the MSM tries to tell you, there are Iraqi's who will help the allies, who will fight alongside them and put their lives at risk to make sure Democracy succeeds in their country.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.14
This brings to mind a speech Prime Minister Tony Blair gave recently while visiting Iraq.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.15
When I meet the people working alongside the United Nations--Iraqis in fear of their life every day, because they are trying to bring freedom and democracy to their people--when I see their courage and their determination and know that they speak for the vast majority of people in Iraq who want that democracy and freedom, then I know that we are doing the right thing.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.16
And I will also say this to you: There are people dying in Iraq, but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.17
Now what should our response be as an international community?
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.18
Our response should be to stand alongside the democrats--the people who've got the courage to see this thing through--and help them see it through.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.19
I've got no doubt at all that that is the right thing for us to do.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.20
Sometimes when I see some of the reporting of what's happening in Iraq in the rest of the world, I just feel that people should understand how precious what has been created here is.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.21
And those people from that electoral commission that I described as the heroes of the new Iraq--every day ... a lot of them aren't living in the Green Zone, they've got to travel in from outside.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.22
They do not know at any point in time whether they're going to be subject to brutality or intimidation, even death, and yet they carry on doing it.
NW_FLO_ENG_0109_2004_1228.23
Now what a magnificent example of the human spirit--that's the side we should be on.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.1
This recent news story is troubling in many different ways.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.2
When I first heard of the story I figured it was some wackjob playing with a new toy but now we find out there have been 7 incidents since Christmas from the West to East coast.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.3
The FBI, concerned that terrorists could use lasers as weapons, is investigating why laser beams were directed into the cockpits of seven airplanes in flight since Christmas.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.4
Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient pilots and possibly cause a plane to crash.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.5
The FBI is looking into two incidents in Colorado Springs, Colo., and one each in Cleveland, Washington, Houston, Teterboro, N.J., and Medford, Ore., according to federal and local law enforcement and transportation officials, some of whom spoke only on condition of anonymity.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.6
A federal law enforcement official, who declined to be identified by name, said Thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terrorist activity.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.7
But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.8
"It's not some kid," said Paul Rancatore, a pilot who serves as deputy chairman of the security committee for the Allied Pilots Association.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.9
"It's too organized."
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.10
Loren Thompson, who teaches military technology at Georgetown University, called it a "rather worrisome development," though he said experts would be more puzzled than alarmed.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.11
"What we're talking about is a fairly powerful visible light laser that has the ability to lock onto a fast-moving aircraft," Thompson said.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.12
"That's not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplus store."
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.13
Thompson said a piece of equipment that could do the things the FBI suspects would be "fairly expensive and fairly sophisticated."
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.14
"It sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents," Thompson said.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.15
Michelle Malkin has a post about this today where some outlets have stopped selling lasers.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.16
Lots of people think that these indeed might be loonies playing with new Christmas toys but I disagree.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.17
These are incidents where the Airplanes were tracked , some as high as 8500 feet.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.18
To track a fast moving plane at that altitude would not be some toy you can get from the local wal-mart.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.19
In my opinion this is quite alarming.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.20
This Isn't Writing, It's Typing has a great post out with a ton of info, some of it quite scary A more frightening scenario is that terrorists may have obtained a Chinese-produced ZM-87 laser blinder which is specifically designed to blind eyesight.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.21
The Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo--which launched the infamous Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995--was discovered to have experimented with the use of lasers as weapons.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.22
According to The Asian Pacific Post, "Cult members apparently obtained laser design information from Russian institutes they visited and built a laser weapon mounted on a truck.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.23
They had planned to use the laser against Tokyo policemen, but the plan failed when the laser malfunctioned during the testing stage."
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.24
PoliticAlex also has some info on this story also.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.25
I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners, which this might very well be a precursor to: Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), pose to commercial airliners.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.26
Most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate this threat.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.27
Instead, a menu of options may be considered, including installing infrared (IR) countermeasures on aircraft; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures; improving airport and regional security; and strengthening missile non-proliferation efforts.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.28
Equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operating in areas where ground-based security measures are unavailable or infeasible to implement.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.29
However, this option has a relatively high cost, between $1 million and $3 million per aircraft, and the time needed for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.30
Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.31
However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.32
Legislation introduced in the 108th Congress (H.R. 580, S. 311) calls for the installation of missile defense systems in all turbojet aircraft used in scheduled air carrier service.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.33
While this legislation is still under consideration, Homeland Security appropriations designated $60 million in FY2004 and $61 million in FY2005 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile countermeasure systems for commercial aircraft based on existing military technology.
NW_FLO_ENG_0110_2004_1230.34
It is anticipated that at the conclusion of this program, in January 2006, the Department of Homeland Security will be able to provide a detailed analysis of the suitability of such systems for use to protect commercial passenger aircraft.

American Future has a link up to a article written in yesterdays Houston Chronicle.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.2
It describes how the European Governments look to be changing their tune in regards to President Bush.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.3
Why you ask?
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.4
But there is arguably more to this sea change than just a grumpy acceptance of the status quo.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.5
From a European perspective, three things are making it easier to warm to the Bush White House.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.6
One is the death of Yasser Arafat.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.7
No issue divides Europe and the United States more keenly than the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.8
For the last few years, Europeans have criticized Bush for failing to put enough pressure on Israel to get out of the occupied territories and for refusing to deal with Arafat.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.9
That another reason why I respect Bush so much, his refusal to acknowledge that windbag terrorist Arafat.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.10
May he rot in hell.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.11
But since Arafat's death, Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground: supporting Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza, putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and, covertly, backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.12
A second reason is Europe's growing worries about Islamic terrorism.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.13
The murder in November of Theo van Gogh, a provocative Dutch filmmaker, at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe's 9/11.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.14
Though the two events are obviously not fully comparable, it is certainly true that American conservatives, such as Francis Fukuyama and Bernard Lewis, have found a wider audience recently for the idea that radical Islam is inimical to European traditions of tolerance.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.15
You mean those radical muslims can be kinda nasty sometimes?
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.16
Get outta here.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.17
...Keep doing business like the cowards in Spain and they will more then likely have their very own 9/11 to cry about.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.18
The third force is the reappearance, albeit in a milder form, of the threat that kept the trans-Atlantic alliance together for half a century.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.19
The Russian bear is growling again.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.20
The Ukrainian election --- complete with its KGB-style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud -- has reminded European diplomats of Vladimir V. Putin's determination to control his "near abroad."
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.21
They should be very worried about this item, I believe Putin is slowly sliding Russia back to what it once was.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.22
Hopefully our Government isn't asleep at the wheel with this situation either.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.23
There is a personal edge to all this.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.24
Just as the snooty continentals eventually came to admire the gormless Hollywood actor, there is a grudging willingness to rethink some prejudices about the inarticulate Texan.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.25
Many European leaders once swallowed the Michael Moore version of history: that Bush was an ignorant interloper who stole the White House.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.26
His thumping re-election, however, shows that he represents a large body of conservative American opinion.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.27
In short, Europeans are getting used to the idea that it is not Bush who is the exception, but the U.S. itself that is exceptional --- and that if they want to deal with this exceptional superpower they need to humor it rather than rile it.
NW_FLO_ENG_0111_2005_0101.28
Strangely enough, this has been Tony Blair's strategy all along; it is rapidly becoming the Continent's strategy, too.

Apparently Bush wants the European's to classify Hezbollah as a terrorist group.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.3
Makes sense right?
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.4
As rising instability in Lebanon increases tensions in the Middle East, the Bush administration is arguing with European governments over whether they should designate the Lebanon-based Shiite group Hezbollah a terrorist organization, American and European officials say.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.5
The United States is already stepping up pressure on Iran and Syria, Hezbollah's main sponsors.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.6
The American rift with Syria deepened this week, with suspicions that Syria might have been behind the assassination of Lebanon's former prime minister in Beirut on Monday.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.7
In the past two weeks, the officials said, France has rebuffed appeals by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, which would prevent it from raising money in Europe through charity groups.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.8
The United States has long called Hezbollah a terrorist organization, but the French, American and European officials said, have opposed doing so, and argue that making such a designation now would be unwise, given the new turbulence in Lebanon.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.9
Israeli and American officials say that the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has told them that he, too, regards Hezbollah as a destructive force in the Middle East, one determined to undermine peace talks by supporting militant groups that attack Israelis.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.10
Gotta love that.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.11
The Palestinian president admits that Hezbollah are a bunch of f-wad terrorists but the French don't agree.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.12
No joke.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.13
The Europeans are not solidly opposed to listing Hezbollah as a terrorist group, the officials said.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.14
The Netherlands, Italy and Poland support the Bush administration's view, several officials said, while Germany and Britain believe the issue is moot unless the French change their minds.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.15
One European diplomat said other countries were "hiding behind" France on the issue.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.16
A European diplomat said the issue of calling Hezbollah a terrorist organization was discussed in Brussels on Wednesday at a meeting of the Clearing House, a unit of the European Union that meets in confidential sessions to review terrorist activities in Europe.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.17
The group could reach no consensus, the diplomat said.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.18
"Nothing is going to change on Hezbollah because we don't have an agreement among the member states," the diplomat said.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.19
"That doesn't mean we won't get a consensus.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.20
I know the Americans are impatient, but the European Union has 25 states, and these things take time."
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.21
Some of those interviewed tried to make it sound as if the reason they are hesitant to go along with Bush is because of the situation in Lebanon.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.22
But as The Captain points out, it probably has more to do with Iran.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.23
I suspect the true reason for the reluctance comes not from the "delicate" nature of Lebanese politics, but from the relationship between Hezbollah and the Iranians.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.24
The EU has tried for the past two years to appease the Iranian mullahs into giving up their nuclear-weapons ambitions to little avail.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.25
They don't want to rock the boat now by attempting to starve out the mullahs' terror agent that conducts the proxy attacks against Israel that Iran cannot afford to do itself openly.
NW_FLO_ENG_0112_2005_0217.26

Romania voted in the last December, ousting the so-called socialist party PSD (Social-Democratic Party).
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.3
PSD managed to keep a stronghold in poor rural areas, with the help of people like Mischie.
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.4
They combined blackmail, using their right of decision regarding the public funds for local leaders opposing PSD, and strong seduction of the uneducated masses, in a marvelous way.
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.5
E.g., Mischie, who talks like an idiot, got a PhD in history.
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.6
His paper was on a political personality of the 19th century and Mischie bought the house where his paper's subject lived.
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.7
Maybe he tried to invest in his paper, maybe he believed sincerely in his admiration for the poor innocent dead guy and his ability of earning PhDs, but using a big car and living in a big house are signs for the masses that the man is an invaluable and irreplaceable leader.
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.8
Another misleading sign was his position as a University professor - he was teaching mostly at private universities, which are still ways to buy diplomas here in Romania.
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.9
Local leaders did their jobs, but national leaders, pressuring TV stations to lie, associating with old communist ex-president Ion Iliescu, failed to win in big cities.
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.10
PSD is building a strategy for the 4 years to come and they are going to elect a leader.
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.11
It is known that communist leaders die in office (as judges of the U.S. Supreme Court) and Ion Iliescu won't be different.
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.12
All the leaders that expressed different points of view will be excluded from the party, that's the untold truth that Romanian media seem to hide or not conceive yet.
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.13
Mischie was right to criticize the national leaders, because PSD got a good share in the elections in his area.
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.14
But Mischie was wrong, because he did that while in vacation in Switzerland, where you can't go if you earn 20K $ a year.
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.15
The new power had nothing to do, but let the policemen do what they should be doing years ago.
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.16
Iliescu and Nastase, ex-president and ex-prime minister, are now left only with the leadership of the party and holding this illusory authority.
NW_GET_ENG_0113_2005_0105.17
If Mischie wouldn't take his chance on them, he would still be free, with the help of the weak and weakening strings Iliescu might still pull.

The interim government declared a state of emergency in Iraq excluding the Kurdish region for 60 days, according to the National Security Law introduced last August which states that emergency laws can be declared in the country for a period no more than 60 days provided a serious threat against Iraqi national security is recognised by the interim government.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.2
Obviously, this is a necessary step that should have been taken at least two months ago.

Suicide bombings and guerrilla attacks carried out by insurgents and foreign terrorists based around Baghdad have escalated to alarming levels particularly during Ramadan.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.4
Deputy governor of Diyala along with several council members from Ba'quba were ambushed and killed in Latifiya south of Baghdad, an area which has supposedly been 'cleared' from insurgents a couple of weeks ago.

Four suicide attacks in Samarra, also a recently 'liberated' area, against National Guard units and the governorate building.

Zarqawi's group claimed responsibility for the attacks.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.7
Three police stations in Haditha, a small town west of Ramadi, were assaulted by groups of insurgents.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.8
Some 30 policemen were captured, tied up and executed in cold blood against the walls following a confrontation which lasted two hours.

A full-scale military operation against Fallujah, which is apparently underway already, seems to be the government's 'final solution'.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.11
I'm not optimistic to the outcome, especially when significant civilian casualties are unavoidable.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.12
Note, that I'm not suggesting a peaceful or political solution would work either in these areas.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.13
Insurgents west of Baghdad have quite obstinately made it clear that nothing but full control of the country, or at least the Anbar governorate, will satisfy them.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.14
They have refused to participate in the political process, they have repeatedly announced their intentions to boycott the elections and to disrupt them in other areas, and they do not recognise the government or any other authority in the country beside themselves.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.15
The demands of the Fallujah negotiants from the government weeks ago were obscene and they clearly reflect the overt sectarianism and regionalism of the armed groups in the area.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.16
The demands were not released to the Iraqi public at the time for unkown reasons but they have leaked out days ago.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.17
Here are just a few of them:
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.18
-A clear timetable for the withdrawal of foreign occupation forces.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.19
(fair enough).
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.20
-Immediate withdrawal of US and Iraqi security forces from the Anbar governorate and the handover of security responsibilities to former army officers from Anbar.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.21
-The appointment of ministers from the Anbar governorate to the ministries of Interior, Defense, Oil and Finance.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.22
-The removal of certain officials (most of them from Shi'ite Islamic parties such as Ibrahim Al-Ja'fari) from governmental positions.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.23
-The complete return of Ba'athists, army officers, Republican Guards, Mukhabarat, intelligence and security personnel to their former positions.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.24
-The removal of Shi'ite Edhan (call for prayers) from official television and radio programs.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.25
-Incomes of Shi'ite sacred shrines should be returned under the control of the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.26
These last two demands have been allegedly added by Sheikh Harith Al-Dhari (head of the Association of Muslim Scholars) and are said to have been a major reason behind the failure of negotiations with the government.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.27
Iraqis here in the south were shocked to hear of these demands and sectarian tensions are on the rise.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.28
It scares me to see the reaction of people around me whenever Fallujah is mentioned.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.29
The director of a primary health care clinic was remarking the other day that "Fallujah should be burnt upon its residents and then razed to the ground.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.30
They are the sons of Mu'awiya, may Allah curse them all."
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.31
Sidenote: Mu'awiya bin Abi Sufyan was the governor of Syria during the 7th century and he fought Imam Ali bin Abi Talib (Muhammed's son-in-law) over the Caliphate after the assassination of Caliph Othman.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.32
He became the first Ummayid Caliph and two decades later, under the Caliphate of his son Yazid, Imam Hussein bin Ali (grandson of Muhammed) was killed by his armies at present day Karbala.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.33
Someone hushed the director and pointed out to him that I'm Sunni.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.34
He was a bit embarrassed and tried to explain that he was referring to Wahhabis and foreign fighters.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.35
It was a bit uncomfortable and I could feel that people were giving me furtive glances.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.36
Refugees have been pouring out of Fallujah over the last few days into Baghdad and the surrounding areas.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.37
The military operation will undoubtly aggravate the humanitarian situation inside the city since there are definitely thousands of families with no place to go.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.38
Refugees in Baghdad have confirmed the rumours that the 'Mujahideen' are forcing men from 15-50 years old to stay and that they were threatened with execution if they refuse to carry arms in defense of the town.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.39
Majlis Shura Al-Mujahideen (The Mujahideen Advisory Council) are in control of Fallujah and they have distributed a statement inviting Arab and foreign (including American) media reporters to enter the town and cover the battles.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.40
The statement carried the insignia of Zarqawi's group Qa'idat Al-Jihad.
NW_HEA_ENG_0114_2004_1108.41
Everyone is closely watching what the next few days will bring, hoping the violence doesn't spread to the streets of Baghdad or other areas.

Bush Refashions Readiness Posture
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.2
AUSTIN, Texas
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.3
President Bush was not going to get caught off guard by Hurricane Rita this weekend.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.4
The president who refused to cut short a working vacation three weeks ago to prepare for the fury of Hurricane Katrina was sitting at the U.S. Northern Command post in Colorado on Saturday morning monitoring what had become a more timid storm.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.5
``I've come here,'' Bush explained, ``to watch NORTHCOM in action, to see firsthand the capacity of our military to plan, organize and move equipment to help the people in the affected areas.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.6
'' Bush's government was on war footing for Rita's arrival: The Pentagon moved 500 active-duty troops to the region and put 27,000 National Guard soldiers on standby.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.7
Navy ships were positioned nearby, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose performance immediately after Katrina symbolized the federal government's mistakes, sent in helicopters, supplies and rescue teams.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.8
``It comforts me knowing that our federal government is well-organized and well-prepared to deal with Rita,'' said Bush, who also devoted his weekly radio address to federal preparations for the hurricane.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.9
Bush's posture toward Rita contrasts sharply with the days after Katrina.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.10
Then, Bush was preoccupied by Medicare, the Iraq war and getting back to his Crawford, Tex., ranch to finish up a month-long hiatus from the White House.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.11
He was seen strumming a guitar at an event in California as New Orleans was filling up with water flowing through breached levees.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.12
It was not until several days after Katrina smashed into New Orleans and destroyed parts of that city that Bush made a serious effort to present a commanding presence over what would become one of the deadliest natural disasters in U.S. history.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.13
Eventually, Bush was forced to offer a rare apology for his government's sluggish response to a storm that has left more than 1,000 dead.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.14
When Rita was approaching, the storm appeared to be packing the same fury as Katrina.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.15
The White House communications team scrambled to find an appropriate setting for Bush to monitor preparations for the next great storm, initially settling on San Antonio, where search-and-rescue teams were stationed in anticipation of Rita.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.16
But the plan hit a glitch -- the search-and-rescue team needed to get closer to a storm whose path was shifting to the north and east and could not wait for a photo-op with the president.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.17
As a result, shortly after Bush had said his stop would not be an inconvenience to preparations, he was forced to scrub the event.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.18
Instead, he flew straight to Colorado Springs, where he would monitor the hurricane from the U.S. Northern Command, which is responsible for the defense of the United States.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.19
In the end, Bush was prepared for a storm that, while serious, had lost some of its fury by the time it hit the Gulf Coast.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.20
As the president prepared to leave Colorado, Rita had been downgraded to a tropical storm, and residents of cities such as Houston and Galveston were breathing easier after avoiding a direct hit.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.21
Major damage was elsewhere, and Rita continued to threaten parts of four states with heavy rains and flooding, but when Bush arrived here Saturday afternoon, the weather was sunny and hot.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.22
Whether the president's aggressive approach to Rita can offset damage to his image is a question of vital interest to his advisers, but several analysts said Bush will need more than a good performance with this storm to turn things around.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.23
``There is a tendency for current news to supplant old news, but the hit he took on Katrina, coupled with the hits he's taken on other areas -- the war, Social Security -- is a heavy load for this current hurricane to lift, even if he does really well,'' said Bruce Buchanan II, professor of government at the University of Texas.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.24
Thomas D. Rath, the Republican national committeeman from New Hampshire, said Rita cannot erase what happened during Katrina, but coming so quickly after the first storm, the second has given Bush an opportunity to show that Katrina was an aberration.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.25
``What they can do is demonstrate they can learn when things didn't go so well, their attention is focused, he's engaged and in the game,'' Rath said.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.26
``The performance to date on this one certainly indicates that.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.27
The worst thing that could have happened would have been for it (the sluggish response) to happen again.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.28
'' Even before Rita made landfall early Saturday, Bush and the federal government were aided by a close working relationship with state and local officials in Texas such as Gov. Rick Perry (R) and Houston Mayor Bill White.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.29
For Katrina, the relationship with New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin and Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco (D) was more acrimonious.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.30
Texas officials appeared well prepared for Rita, despite problems that plagued the evacuation of the Houston area on Thursday, and federal emergency officials showed they, too, had learned the lessons of Katrina.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.31
Paul Light, a government professor at New York University, noted the improved performance by FEMA and the readiness of state and local officials in the areas affected by Rita, but said that because Rita appeared to be less devastating than Katrina Bush might gain little no matter how effective the response.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.32
``Without being at all insensitive to the damage, this is not the hurricane that would redeem George Bush's standing as a bold leader,'' he said.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.33
``From a political standpoint, I don't think that it helps him very much,'' he said.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.34
White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush had a larger purpose to the weekend's events: to spend more time investigating whether Congress should increase the federal role in responding to catastrophes.
NW_LTW_ENG_0117_2005_0924.35
A decision has not been made, but aides said Bush is moving in that direction.

A Lesson From Katrina: Pets Matter
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.2
WASHINGTON
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.3
Jason Wesley has always considered herself a sensible woman, the kind who keeps flashlights and bottled water handy -- just in case.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.4
But she never thought that instinct would one day lead her to the floor of a veterinarian's office, giving mouth-to-mouth to a fake dog.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.5
That's where she ended up after Hurricane Katrina, enrolled in a pet first aid class.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.6
Thinking of her puppy at home, she put her mouth to the plastic snout and began to blow.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.7
This is the emerging field of disaster planning for pets, filled with doomsday scenarios, four-legged victims and people who love them.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.8
For years, despite an estimated 69 million U.S. households with a pet, animal advocates have been relegated to the fringes of emergency planning.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.9
After Katrina, however, and the sight of people in New Orleans refusing to evacuate and in some cases dying with their pets, emergency officials are starting to take animal rescue seriously.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.10
By saving the pets, advocates said, owners can be saved as well.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.11
On Capitol Hill, five representatives have proposed making pet disaster planning mandatory by tying it to federal funds.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.12
Meanwhile, many pet owners have begun to make plans.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.13
``People are finally realizing that this is a serious issue,'' said Lynne Bettinger, a Red Cross-certified instructor in pet first aid.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.14
The concept is as old as Noah's Ark, but modern pet disaster planning didn't truly begin, U.S. experts said, until after Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.15
When Andrew tore through South Florida, it killed more than 100 animals in the Miami Metrozoo.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.16
Hundreds of others, including baboons, antelope and 500-pound Galapagos tortoises, wandered off through the rubble.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.17
Escaped horses drowned in canals.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.18
``For the first time, people saw this happening on TV,'' said Oliver Davidson, senior disaster adviser for the Humane Society of the United States.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.19
``It was like the launching pad for awareness of the issue.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.20
'' After Andrew, the federal government created Veterinary Medical Assistance Teams, to be deployed wherever animal-threatening disasters hit.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.21
The 1992 hurricane also prompted the Humane Society to establish a department devoted to disaster planning and rescue.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.22
Davidson was one of the people the Humane Society recruited.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.23
For 20 years, he had coordinated U.S. assistance after foreign catastrophes.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.24
But after working 320 disasters, he left his federal post to address what he saw as a gaping hole in the field.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.25
``When I first started this job, I would take my brochures and planning documents to all the emergency management meetings,'' Davidson said.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.26
Some attendees listened politely, a few made jokes and most dismissed his work as trivial.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.27
``They would say, 'Well, we know it's a possible problem, but frankly, the threat is not that high.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.28
' '' Until Hurricane Katrina.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.29
Katrina killed more than 1,000 people in the Gulf region.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.30
It is unknown how many animals died, state and local officials said.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.31
Also unknown, they said, is the number of people who died because they stayed with their pets.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.32
TV coverage showed residents who had stayed with their pets stranded on rooftops.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.33
Many said they stayed because shelters, including those operated by the Red Cross, didn't allow pets because of health and safety reasons.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.34
Federal and state rescuers, whose focus was on saving humans, forced residents to leave behind their animals.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.35
``But people refused to be rescued without their pets,'' said Terry Kane, a veterinarian deployed to New Orleans by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.36
``It created a disaster within a disaster.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.37
'' New Orleans' animal control and rescue groups set up a staging area at the Lamar-Dixon Expo Center near Gonzales, La., where they handled about 8,500 rescued animals.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.38
Louisiana State University also opened a shelter where evacuees could leave pets at its coliseum in Baton Rouge.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.39
``There was a plan, but not for something on this level,'' said David Senior, head of LSU's veterinary clinical sciences.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.40
``It was a pretty steep learning curve.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.41
'' Floodwaters destroyed the animal control building in Orleans Parish and forced many animal control officers to evacuate.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.42
Authorities began deputizing volunteers to help, but lack of expertise led to problems.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.43
``There were complaints from people sitting in their living room having dinner, and rescue workers just crowbarred through their door looking for pets,'' Senior said. FEMA activated all four of its veterinary units, making it what the agency called the largest simultaneous deployment of veterinary relief in U.S. history -- more than 200 veterinarians.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.44
But the veterinary teams were ill-equipped because of FEMA's policies, team members said. FEMA forbids veterinarians from using their own equipment, accepting donations or buying supplies.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.45
In the end, many teams said they had to break FEMA's rules to save animals.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.46
``We didn't have fluids, antibiotics, euthanasia fluid, not even boots and rubber gloves for the toxic water,'' said Barry Kellogg, deputy commander of one team.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.47
In the following months, animal groups were inundated with requests for preparedness guides and seminars.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.48
The Humane Society's list of volunteers for disasters swelled from about 200 before Katrina into the thousands.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.49
The nonprofit organization raised more than $23 million in hurricane relief and used it to send teams to the Gulf region with new laptops, satellite phones and trailers.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.50
``Katrina has changed things like nothing else,'' Davidson said.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.51
``It's pushed the issue to a level we've never seen, even with Hurricane Andrew.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.52
'' Weeks after Katrina, as Hurricane Rita approached Texas, officials suspended rules that banned pets from shelters, saying they had learned from Katrina.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.53
Texas' homeland security chief and Galveston's mayor urged people to evacuate with their pets.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.54
Several states, including New York and Pennsylvania, have since begun revising their evacuation plans to include pets.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.55
In two Maryland counties, Calvert and Montgomery, planners are trying to establish emergency pet shelters alongside those for humans.

Animal groups from across the country will gather in Crystal City, Va., near Washington, this spring for a national disaster planning summit.

Many plan to lobby for a bill, proposed recently in the House, that would require state and local emergency agencies to establish pet policies to qualify for FEMA grants.

With all the sudden attention, such longtime disaster planners as Davidson say people are starting to treat animal advocates less as jokes and more like partners.
NW_LTW_ENG_0119_2006_0102.59
But in a field devoted to worst-case scenarios, a little pessimism -- even now, as pet disaster planning reaches new heights -- is inevitable.

``We're trying very hard to push now, while people still remember,'' Davidson said.

Nature Hinders Tsunami Recovery in Indonesia
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.2
LHOK BUBON, Indonesia
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.3
The massive tsunami that crashed into Sumatra island in December ripped Ibu Yusniar's home from its concrete foundation.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.4
But while the stout woman survived, wrapping her arms around a column in a nearby mosque to ride out the surging waters, nature was not through.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.5
Three months later, the sea gobbled up part of her land when another huge earthquake struck.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.6
Then, the full-moon tides in July completed the job, reducing the balance of her property in Lhok Bubon village to salty swamp.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.7
``The tide came in and it didn't go out,'' recounted her cousin, Suharman.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.8
More than half a year after the tsunami devastated Aceh province, killing at least 150,000 Indonesians, dramatic shifts in topography are continuing to reshape Sumatra, hampering efforts to conduct the gargantuan task of reconstruction.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.9
The Dec. 26 tsunami submerged swaths of seafront and inundated thousands of acres of rice paddies.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.10
The March 28 earthquake, measuring 8.9 on the Richter scale, then lowered the elevation of the island's western coast, dipping much of Aceh's rim into the Indian Ocean.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.11
Rain, high tides, westerly winds and erosion have further recast the shoreline and rerouted rivers.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.12
``Things that usually happen over hundreds of years are happening here over three to six months,'' said Kevin Austin, who completed his tour this month as the U.N. Development Program's chief officer in western Aceh.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.13
``This is really a unique situation.''
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.14
Combined with the herculean labor of carting away millions of tons of tsunami rubble and the Indonesian government's initial confusion over how to allocate resources, the ordeal of mapping villages and assigning land ownership has impaired new housing construction.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.15
Officials have estimated that more than 500,000 people in Aceh are still homeless as a result of the tsunami.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.16
Relief agency officials and local activists agree that the pace of activity has accelerated in the last three months after the government set up an authority to streamline reconstruction.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.17
The move cleared up much of the earlier disarray caused by overlapping proposals from the scores of agencies working in Aceh and helped secure faster funding from both the Indonesian parliament and abroad.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.18
But none of the major undertakings, such as primary roads, ports and power plants, are close to completion, and smaller projects, including houses and schools, remain relatively few and scattered.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.19
Of the more than 200,000 new homes required in the province, Indonesian officials have reported, barely 3,000 have been finished.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.20
Among the areas hardest hit by the tsunami were the villages and towns of Aceh's western coast.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.21
In Lhok Bubon, a remote fishing hamlet about 10 miles from the main west coast town of Meulaboh, more than a third of the villagers were killed and about 95 homes destroyed.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.22
Half of those were in a neighborhood that has since become uninhabitable marsh.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.23
Most of the survivors have settled in worn, sun-bleached tents pitched, whenever possible, on the razed foundations of their old homes or in shanties cobbled together from scavenged bits of wood, tarp and corrugated metal.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.24
``I had intended to rebuild in the same place, on the existing foundation,'' said Ibu Yusniar, 43, crouching among a small knot of women beneath a tarp.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.25
``But now my land is just water and sand.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.26
The land keeps changing.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.27
The coast keeps coming.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.28
Every tide makes it worse.''
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.29
She flashed a sad smile.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.30
The tsunami had killed many of her relatives but fortunately spared her cousin Suharman, who, like many Indonesians, uses one name.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.31
He had agreed to live on a corner of his village property, at a safer distance from the sea, and let her rebuild there.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.32
Suharman, won the approval of the village elders for his plan.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.33
But the process of officially registering the titles and starting construction seemed endless, he complained.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.34
Across this damaged village, he and other survivors fretted that it now appeared their new homes would not be ready in time for the start of the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, in October.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.35
``We have no idea when we'll move out of this tent,'' said Sapuan, 35, a squat woman, her hands clasped tensely in her lap.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.36
``It's so hard.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.37
Sometimes there are storms.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.38
There's rain and wind.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.39
Maybe we'll have to stay here.''
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.40
Two of Sapuan's three daughters were swept away in the tsunami.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.41
Her surviving daughter, 10, floated to safety by clutching a bamboo branch.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.42
Beginning next month, World Vision, a Christian nonprofit organization, plans to build 83 new dwellings in Lhok Bubon and complete them by the end of the year, according to Geno Teofilo, a spokesman.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.43
In anticipation, Sapuan and her husband have bought a new lot farther from the beach, paying for the land by working as laborers to clear debris from the village.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.44
They daydream about moving to a house in time for Ramadan.
NW_LTW_ENG_0206_2005_0813.45

Gazprom, the main Russian gas company, has been denied a $10 billion credit line due to the political situation in Russia.
NW_MAR_ENG_0120_2004_1217.2
The company intended to use the cash to pay an artificially low price for Yukos assets (hence that firm's bankruptcy filing a few days ago -- you know it's bad when you have to use US courts to protect your own assets from appropriation by your home country).
NW_MAR_ENG_0120_2004_1217.3
It's starting to look like Putin's goal is a sort of judicial nationalization -- taking control of key assets through court, rather than executive, fiat.
NW_MAR_ENG_0120_2004_1217.4
But the markets have caught on, and Russia may be deprived of the capital it needs to grow.

One of the rules of thumb that has guided my (limited) business career from the beginning is that China is never as lucrative as it looks.
NW_MAR_ENG_0121_2005_0127.2
This assumption is based on about 150 years of economic history, including several booms in interest and investment in China.
NW_MAR_ENG_0121_2005_0127.3
Their biggest problem: There's usually a 200-to-1 ratio of Nearly Starving Peasant Laborers to Absurdly Well-Off Government Employees.
NW_MAR_ENG_0121_2005_0127.4
And now it's an iffier 100-to-1, since there are also rich private sector employees and the labor force isn't quite so expendable.

What they've been missing for years was the real driver behind any consumer economy: Consumers.
NW_MAR_ENG_0121_2005_0127.6
Specifically, they didn't have a real middle class.
NW_MAR_ENG_0121_2005_0127.7
That's changed in the last twenty years, as increasing social mobility and a burst in foreign demand has finally made China a genuine, rather than theoretical, contender.

And they've even supplied proof of their economic viability, announcing that they've beaten Japan for exports to the US.

One of the sailors wrote a letter during those terrible final hours.

Today, 10 weeks after a mysterious accident sent the Kursk to the bottom of the Barents sea, a grisly discovery.

In the pocket of one of the crew, a handwritten note, dying words of a sailor trapped alive in the sunken sub.
NW_MNB_ENG_0126_2000_1026.5
He is this lieutenant captain, seen here three years ago aboard the Kursk.

His last words tell a chilling tail -- tale of a desperate but future ill attempt to escape.
NW_MNB_ENG_0126_2000_1026.7
It now appears 23 survived -- survived the initial explosion.
NW_MNB_ENG_0126_2000_1026.8
The 23 frantically scrambled to the rear of the sub.

What went wrong?
NW_NBC_ENG_0128_2000_1009.9
To many peace seemed so close at Camp David in July.
NW_NBC_ENG_0128_2000_1009.10
How did it all fall apart?
NW_NBC_ENG_0128_2000_1009.11
First, Palestinian resentment.
NW_NBC_ENG_0128_2000_1009.12
On the street, people see no economic rewards, aren't any better off after years of peace talks, and they resent the U.S. for blaming Arafat when the summit collapses while praising Israel's prime minister Barak.
NW_NBC_ENG_0128_2000_1009.13
The prime minister moved forward more from his initial position than chairman Arafat, particularly surrounding the questions of Jerusalem.
NW_NBC_ENG_0128_2000_1009.14
It's quite clear the Palestinians do not accept the various proposals put forward to divide Jerusalem.

Many Israelis feel Barak goes too far by offering Arafat partial control of the holy sites, gets nothing in return.
NW_NBC_ENG_0128_2000_1009.21
I think Barak was very forthcoming at Camp David.
NW_NBC_ENG_0128_2000_1009.22
The intransigence or failure of Arafat to come forward with any counterproposal I think frustrated the prime minister and frustrated the Israelis.

Finally, the summit raises false hopes, is not well prepared by Washington.

The U.S. rushes ahead, eager for a breakthrough before the end of Clinton's term.
NW_NBC_ENG_0128_2000_1009.26
Other Arab leaders like Mubarak of Egypt and Fahd of Saudi Arabia are not sold on the deal, tell Arafat to hold out.
NW_NBC_ENG_0128_2000_1009.27
If a concerted effort was put together to consult with these people and bring them on board, then probably Arafat would have been able to cut a deal.

AS RESIDENTS TRY TO FLEE STORM CELL, TORNADO TRACKERS PURSUE IT
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.2
Nine times on Monday, Joshua Wurman and his storm-chasing team of scientists from the University of Oklahoma saw clouds drop out of the sky and spin.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.3
The first two tornadoes they spotted Monday afternoon helped their research, but the third one that dropped near the tiny town of Cement, Okla., took them on the ride of their lives.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.4
For several hours, they chased a half-mile-wide tornado with winds clocked in excess of 200 mph as it swept through Chickasha, Newcastle, Moore, Del City and then Midwest City, killing dozens and destroying thousands of homes before vanishing.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.5
Their adrenaline surged as their van sped toward the debris-filled spiral, stopped to set up Doppler radar long enough to record data about the twister, then rushed back into the van to continue the chase.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.6
While others fled from the path of the dozens of tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kansas, Wurman _ nationally renowned tornado chaser _ and his team pursued the deadly twister.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.7
Fear seldom crossed their minds, Wurman said, even though they were once within a few hundred feet from what scientists gauged as at least an F4 tornado, the second-strongest level on the Fujita Scale.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.8
But a pinprick of reality invaded their scientific sphere in Moore, on the southwestern edge of Oklahoma City.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.9
``We drove through Moore probably a minute after the tornado, through the damage path,'' Wurman said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.10
The twister cut a three-mile-long, five-to-six-block wide swath through the town, destroying hundreds of homes, smashing automobiles and uprooting trees.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.11
``It was difficult to see,'' Wurman said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.12
Louis J. Wicker, an associate professor of meteorology at Texas A&M University, said, ``In terms of a single tornado, it will be among the top 10 in this century.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.13
'' Wurman added that the data scientists collected Monday might lead to a better assessment of how massive tornadoes work and enable scientists to give residents more warning before such devastation hits.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.14
``There is not much we can do to prevent the homes from being destroyed,'' Wurman said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.15
``We hope we can get them to shelter.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.16
'' Early reports said the half-mile-wide tornado was on the ground for an unprecedented four hours, but Wurman estimated the time as closer to an hour or two.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.17
He didn't keep track of the duration, but will have a precise time line when researchers sift through the tons of computer data his team collected for the 12-hour period they trailed tornadoes.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.18
But even one or two hours is rare, Wurman and other scientists said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.19
``It is pretty uncommon for an hour and happens only a couple of times a year,'' Wicker said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.20
Monday started as a favorable day for tornadoes, but not a perfect one, Wurman said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.21
Because of high cloud cover, which can inhibit tornado development, some storm chasers didn't go out to hunt for tornadoes, he said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.22
Wurman and a few other tornado watchers decided to take a chance.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.23
Scientists don't completely understand the complexities of tornadoes, but they know that when hot and cold air collide, the hot air rushes rapidly upward, pulling even more air up from the earth's surface.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.24
If nothing stops the circulation, the air masses can begin to twist and turn the huge cloud mass.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.25
Monday, several supercell storms developed over Oklahoma and Kansas dropping maybe 50 or more tornadoes.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.26
Tornadoes of such duration and intensity as those described Monday afternoon through early Tuesday morning occur only when the atmosphere is very unstable and updraft winds reach at least 150 mph with nothing to shut it off, Wicker said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.27
Wurman said they had the half-mile-wide twister in their sight for most of the 40 miles it traveled.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.28
``We believe it was continuous, although we can't say 100 percent for certain,'' he said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.29
Using Doppler radar, Wurman and his team spotted an even bigger tornado at least a mile wide about 11 p.m. between Crescent and Mulhall, north of Oklahoma City, he said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.30
University of Oklahoma researchers should have some details about the twisters within a few days, Wurman said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.31
Had the storm hit at 2 a.m. when more people were home asleep, many more would have died, Wurman said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.32
The misfortune Monday ``was not that it was just a large tornado, but that it lasted a long time and passed through a populated area,'' he said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0132_1999_0504.33
``I am amazed with the description that more were not killed.

GALVESTON'S BOOM WEATHERS THREATS BY TEXAS HURRICANES; REAL ESTATE STILL ATTRACTING BUYERS HOUSTON
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.2
Luis and Sandra Orosco weren't going to let something like a hurricane crush their dream of owning a second home in Galveston.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.3
Less than two weeks after Hurricane Rita struck the Gulf Coast, narrowly missing the burgeoning resort island south of Houston, the Oroscos were signing closing papers on a 1,800-square-foot four-bedroom vacation home in Pirate's Beach, a swanky west Galveston subdivision.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.4
"Before we decided to make the purchase, we had in our minds that this could happen," Luis Orosco, a 39-year-old Houston physician, said about the hurricane.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.5
"If you want to have a house down there, it's something you have to live with."
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.6
For the Oroscos and others buying property, recent memories of two major Gulf Coast hurricanes and the threat of future ones hasn't dampened their enthusiasm for Galveston real estate.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.7
It didn't hurt that signs of damage caused by Hurricane Rita in Galveston were minimal.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.8
On East Beach, where the Houston-based Falcon Group recently broke ground on two high-rise condominium buildings called Palisade Palms, the only mark of the storm was an awning that fell from the sales trailer set up at the site.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.9
About 75 percent of the 288 units there were sold before the hurricane, and no buyer has backed out of a sales contract since.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.10
But visits to the sales office haven't been as brisk.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.11
"The people coming down and visiting has slowed down substantially, but I'm confident it it will start picking up," said Richard Anderson, vice president of Falcon Group.

Stan Creech, who owns of a commercial real estate firm in Houston, is building a home in Beachside Village, a 60-acre residential community under development on the west end of the island.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.13
Hurricane Rita's relatively mild impact on Galveston didn't curb his bullishness on the area and his investment.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.14
"Hurricanes, floods and earthquakes can happen anywhere in the U.S. or in the world," Creech said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.15
Interest in waterfront property along the Texas Gulf Coast has created a construction boom in Galveston, where condominium towers and beach houses seem to be going up at every turn.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.16
"In spite of hurricanes and the constant threat we live with, people want to be near water," said Dianne McDonough of John Daugherty Realtors, which just opened an office in Galveston.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.17
Demand for Galveston property has pushed up home prices there, too, said McDonough, who has seen annual appreciation upwards of 20 percent in some cases.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.18
The Oroscos are betting on that potential upside.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.19
"I wanted to get into the Galveston market before it really got hot," Orosco said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.20
"I think there's still room for the market to go up even more."
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.21
Developers building some of the waterfront homes and condos also seem unfazed that potentially damaging storms could affect their sales.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.22
Miguel Prida, who's constructing an oceanfront condominium building on Seawall Boulevard, will soon begin work on a second one down the road.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.23
If there has been a slowdown in sales activity on the island, he hasn't seen it.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.24
He's even expecting to attract buyers who owned property on or near the shores of Mississippi and Alabama.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.25
"There's always a market," Prida said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.26
"I'm not concerned one bit."
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.27
While some real estate agents said buyer activity dipped slightly in the weeks after Hurricane Rita, they also said a slowdown this time of year is normal.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.28
The only effect it had was that it delayed some closings, said Kevin Stohlman, a broker with Century 21 Bay Reef Realty who specializes in properties on the West End.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.29
Stohlman said he expects to see more interest for Galveston real estate because of the media attention it received during Hurricane Rita.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.30
"The hurricane didn't do a thing, but the press from the hurricane missing us is good," he said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.31
He also said there hasn't been a rush of people lining up to sell their properties, worried that another hurricane might destroy their homes.
NW_NYT_ENG_0136_2005_1014.32
"Galveston people are wonderful survivor-type people," Stohlman said.

Signs of Hurricane Rita still abound in Southeast Texas six months later.

NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.8
"It looked like a bomb had exploded."
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.9
Among the fallen trees and shattered homes in those first disastrous days were a few signs of hope: the "We Will Rebuild" sign spray painted on a bit of debris where Craig and Patty Broussard's home once stood in Holly Beach, La., and "Johnny's OK" on a piece of plywood in front of a damaged Kirbyville, Texas, convenience store.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.10
Johnny's still OK.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.11
Johnny Rashid reopened his Stop N Stay a few weeks ago, his daughter, Kasey Simmons, said.

Her father often spent the night in a trailer next to the store and would have ridden out the storm there if her mother hadn't made him stop selling gas and evacuate at 1 a.m. Saturday.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.14
A metal canopy crushed the trailer when winds blew through.

"They are struggling, but they're trying," Simmons said last week of her parents.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.16
That makes them emblematic of Southeast Texas.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.17
Jourdan has said from the beginning that he thinks the region will need five years to return to pre-Rita conditions and stands by the estimate.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.18
He has been heavily involved in efforts, many of them unsuccessful, to get more state and federal dollars to put Southeast Texas back together.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.19
Finally, things are starting to move from recovery to rebuilding, Jourdan said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.20
Debris removal is essentially done.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.21
Deadlines for registering with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and applying for Small Business Administration loans are approaching.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.22
Insurance money is coming in.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.23
The struggle is not over, though.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.24
"We've got tens of thousands of homes that still need repair," Jourdan said, noting that he just got his own new roof three weeks ago.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.25
Many of those that still need help are elderly, disabled or of limited means.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.26
"They don't have the resources to do that nor, unless we get that supplemental (federal) money, will (they ever) have the resources to do it," Jourdan said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.27
Money also is being sought to help local governments, farmers, nonprofits and social service needs, he said. FEMA already has provided more than half a billion dollars in assistance to Texas households with Hurricane Rita losses and continues to see new people register for help.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.28
"We don't want anyone to slip through the cracks," spokesman Charles Powell said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.29
The agency has no estimates of how long hurricane recovery normally takes.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.30
"Every disaster is different.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.31
We're actually going out longer term because it was back to back," Powell said, referring to the one-two punch of Hurricane Katrina less than a month before Rita.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.32
"You had evacuees here, and then you have a hurricane."
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.33
The Hurricane Katrina evacuees crowding the region complicated the Hurricane Rita evacuation, as did the exodus from the Houston area.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.34
Efforts to improve Texas evacuations began as a result of the problems.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.35
A state task force offered recommended changes last month, which remain with the staff of Gov. Rick Perry.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.36
"We are currently reviewing them to determine which ones require action by the Legislature and which can be implemented quickly to protect our Texas coasts before the next hurricane season," spokeswoman Rachael Novier said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.37
On the national scale, Hurricane Rita will go down in history as one of the 20 strongest hurricanes ever to hit the United States, said Sam Shamburger, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, La. Regionally, it will be seen as one of the strongest and one of the worst, he said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.38
With Rita, insured losses have been estimated at $4.7 billion by an insurance information service.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.39
The Texas Department of State Health Services attributed 118 deaths to the storm.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.40
Those included direct and indirect deaths, such as the 23 people who died when a bus carrying evacuees from a Houston-area assisted living center caught fire near Dallas.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.41
As property owners and government entities continue to deal with Rita's damage, meteorologists continue to analyze its force and the weather phenomena surrounding it.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.42
A final report by the National Hurricane Center likely will be released later this month or in April, Shamburger said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.43
"We want an accurate representation of what happened," Shamburger said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0137_2006_0323.44
"We want to know what the actual winds were, actual storm surge values and compare that to the damage that was caused so we can better predict future hurricanes and what kind of damage they might cause."

FAMILIES HOLD FAINT HOPE FOR THE MISSING
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.2
THALANGUTTA, India
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.3
First, the water came up to Nagappa Rao's knees.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.4
Then, as he and his family ran from the waves, the water came up to his waist.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.5
As he struggled, the water went over his 8-year-old son's head.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.6
Finally, it slipped into his throat, ran up his nose and down into his lungs.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.7
That's the last thing Rao remembers.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.8
He doesn't remember how he survived.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.9
He doesn't remember when exactly his son's hand slipped out of his.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.10
He doesn't remember being found hours by later by his wife, coughing salt water, wedged between a mile marker and some debris.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.11
But ask Rao anything about his life before the tsunami, and he remembers everything.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.12
He remembers how his son loved swimming.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.13
How his son begged him to teach him how to fish.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.14
After a long silence, Rao says he even remembers how his son's hand felt in his hand as they ran from the tsunami.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.15
How it felt in the last moment before his son disappeared.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.16
Waves the size of a double-decker bus rushed into this village on the east coast of India Dec. 26, killing 35 of its nearly 3,000 residents and washing another 400 out to sea.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.17
Those 400 missing, including Rao's son, are by now undoubtedly dead.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.18
But until the bodies are found, frantic wives continue to wear the colored saris of a married Hindu woman, and the fathers continue to collect relief supplies for the missing in the faint hope they will return.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.19
Nearly 10,000 people died the morning after Christmas across the eastern coast of this country, many in villages just like this.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.20
Nearly as many are said to be missing.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.21
When the water finally receded, it left behind in Thalangutta a landscape of grief so devastating it is nearly impossible to grasp.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.22
Three children -- ages 7, 8 and 11 -- died in the building behind Rao's house, while the parents are still missing.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.23
A hundred yards down the body of an old woman was found tangled in fishnets that trapped her legs.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.24
On the street along the now normal seas people line up and wait for the tanker with water to fill the empty plastic cannisters they balance on their knees.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.25
Rao's grief is insurmountable.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.26
Along with his home, his boat and his son, he also lost all his family albums.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.27
"All I want is one photo," he says.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.28
His wife says that Rao wants to put the picture in a locket, so that when he holds it he can think he is holding his son.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.29
The fishermen who live in Thalangutta have nowhere to go.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.30
Up north, near Chennai, the shanty towns are already crowded.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.31
Further south, the devastation is absolute -- there are districts where nearly one in five people died.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.32
"I want another boat," 40-year-old Vijay Thengary said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.33
"I want to support my family with the fish I catch."
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.34
Thengary and his wife lived in a small blue house, not much bigger than a hotel room.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.35
Their front door opened to a sandy beach and palm trees, where Thengary would strap his red, orange and blue boat.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.36
He was fishing the morning of the tsunami, barely feeling the waves moving at the speed of a jetliner toward the house his father built.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.37
His wife, with her children Divya and Devan in tow, ran nearly a mile, the water close at their heels.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.38
And then, they ran some more.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.39
Thengary returned from sea to find his house in ruins and his wife in shock.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.40
In the chaos following the tsunami, his boat washed out to sea, and he has run out of money.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.41
"My family are not beggars," said Thengary, as he and his wife stood by the ruins of their house.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.42
But for now they have no choice.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.43
They must beg from the relief teams that sometimes stop by, and from the government officials who haggle over how much compensation the families are to receive.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.44
There are formulas for these things.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.45
A dead child is worth less than a dead man who once held a job.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.46
A dead mother is worth less than a dead father.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.47
And a dead widow is worth the least -- the family of the woman who died with the fishnets tangled around her legs received 5,000 rupies - a little more than $100.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.48
More money is promised, more aid is supposed to be on the way.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.49
But until then, the fishermen of Thalangutta must wait.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.50
And beg.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.51
Back in Chennai, the 96,000 pounds of supplies that arrived Thursday from the greater Cincinnati airport sit in a warehouse as relief workers plan how to distribute the aid to the people most in need.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.52
Friday, the relief plane will leave for Sri Lanka, where a civil war has complicated the delivery of supplies.
NW_NYT_ENG_0207_2005_0106.53
There, a medical team that includes Dr. James Laws of Germantown, Ohio, will attempt to deliver medicine to a remote hospital in territory held by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or LTTE.

EARTHQUAKE DEATH TOLL HIGHLIGHTS COSTS OF CHINA'S RISE
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.2
DUJIANGYAN, China
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.3
As the devastation caused by China's earthquake grows, citizens have begun to question whether poor quality and illegal construction are responsible for some or even much of a death toll that reached 28,000 on Saturday and looks certain to climb.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.4
China's roaring economy often has outpaced Beijing's ability to ensure safety, while a widening gap between China's rich and poor has left many communities unable to meet government building codes.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.5
As rescuers picked through the wreckage this week, the inordinate burden borne by the poor became clear - most of the buildings that collapsed in the 7.8 magnitude quake were old and poorly maintained or were built on shoestring budgets, their owners unable to afford contractors and anything but the cheapest materials.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.6
In Juyuan, a farm town of 20,000 people west of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, some residents blamed the local government for not improving a school building that collapsed, killing some 900 students.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.7
Wu Jiefu, a 52-year-old farmer whose niece died in the school, called the structure "tofu," a reference to the shoddy construction techniques of the 1980s, when the building was made.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.8
Newer structures nearby had not fallen, but the classroom building had collapsed in "a few seconds," said Zhang Yuhua, a cook at the school.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.9
Questions about official responsibility for China's soaring death toll are certain to multiply as residents across an area the size of Maryland bury their dead and seek to explain what happened.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.10
In Sichuan, China's hardest hit province, 6,898 school buildings were destroyed in the earthquake, Han Jin, a Ministry of Education official, wrote on a government Web site.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.11
Stories of student deaths have dominated much of China's media coverage.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.12
At one middle school, at least 500 students were buried.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.13
At another, near Wenchuan, a town near the earthquake's epicenter, 270 students were confirmed dead, state media reported.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.14
On Thursday afternoon, dozens of children's bodies were laid on a concrete crematorium floor near Juyuan.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.15
Families mourned the dead and dressed them in new clothing for the afterlife while truck after truck arrived with more dead.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.16
"The machinery here is already overloaded," a police officer said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.17
"We've started to send the bodies to other crematoriums."
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.18
The high death toll has angered many Chinese.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.19
On one popular Web site, someone wrote that it is "unjust that the government building in Wenchuan survived while the schools collapsed!"
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.20
Wang Liang, a taxi driver in Chengdu, said that "people have realized that the failure of school buildings is a serious problem."
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.21
"We will hold the government accountable," he said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.22
Experts also raised concerns about the condition of hundreds of dams in the earthquake zone.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.23
Workers found cracks in the Zipingpu dam above Dujiangyan, a city of 600,000 people, and began releasing water from its reservoir on Wednesday to reduce pressure on the structure.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.24
The huge dam would likely hold, but dams further west on the Min River were damaged more badly, said Fan Xiao, a government geologist in Chengdu.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.25
Equipment controlling sluice gates at the 50-foot-tall Taipingyi dam had failed and with rain forecast the reservoir will rise and the dam "probably will break," releasing a tsunami down the valley, he said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.26
Experts and soldiers were rushing to it and other dams to assess and mitigate the dangers, but because roads are blocked, heavy equipment cannot be brought in, he added.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.27
Some of the construction failures were unavoidable: In some communities, almost every building was destroyed.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.28
But the high death toll was also the result of poor government oversight, shoddy construction and poverty, experts said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.29
Beijing began requiring schools be built to withstand strong earthquakes "several years ago" but most do not meet the codes because local governments have not upgraded the structures, said Fang Ehua, a building safety expert at Tsinghua University.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.30
The Hong Kong government spends about $11 million to build a school for several hundred students, much of the cost to ensure that the building will withstand natural disasters, but in China "a hundred schools" might be built with the money, said Greg Wong, a Hong Kong-based structural engineer who has worked in China.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.31
"There is not much wrong with the standards, but the problem is that in villages, they won't go through such rigorous design," he said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.32
"It's a matter of resources."
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.33
China's dams face similar problems.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.34
A report last year by the national Ministry of Water Resources found that by the end of 2005, 798 dams in Sichuan were "dangerous or poorly built."
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.35
Last month, the same ministry reported that 3,415 illegal dams - most of them supplying electricity to poor, rural communities - were operating in China and most had not been inspected for safety.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.36
"The development of dams is happening too fast and the government does not have enough experts to oversee safety," Fan, the Chengdu-based geologist, said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.37
For Chinese living in the earthquake zone, poverty was a greater cause of damage.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.38
Most of the buildings that collapsed were old and poorly made.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.39
In Li Min Village, a community of 2,000 people along a mountain road west of Chengdu, almost every home was destroyed by the quake.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.40
Residents in the village farm and work odd jobs in nearby cities and the wealthiest families earn only several hundred dollars a month.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.41
Villagers said most local houses had cost between $1,000 and $2,000.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.42
"The government has never cared about us," said Liu Zouquan, a villager standing next to a shattered dresser in the rubble of his former house.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.43
"We only build what we can afford."
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.44
In Dujiangyan, most of the buildings that fell were more than 15 years old, a long time in China's hyper-drive economy, said Wu Kang, an accountant who had set up a tent in a downtown park.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.45
"The poorest people were hit the hardest," he said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.46
As China's rescue operations wind down in coming days and the long job of rebuilding begins, citizens have begun to ask how to avoid similar tragedies.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.47
On Wednesday, the China Daily, the mouthpiece newspaper of the Communist Party, editorialized that "the deadly collapses of school buildings show that (government funds) either remain inadequate or are allocated too slowly for local schools to renovate their buildings so that they can withstand major quakes."
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.48
A posting on a well-read Chinese Web site blamed officials for misusing funds that could have improved schools.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.49
"One word explains the school collapses: Corruption," the anonymous missive read.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.50
Fan, the government geologist, said the earthquake would force scrutiny of dam safety, possibly even highlighting risks to China's Three Gorges Dam, the world's biggest dam.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.51
The Three Gorges Dam was built to withstand a magnitude 7 earthquake, bigger than any recorded in the region.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.52
But it sits near two fault lines and the potential devastation of a breach should have convinced China's top leaders to reinforce it further, he said.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.53
Last Monday's earthquake was the strongest ever recorded in that part of Sichuan province, he added.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.54
At the same time, the heavy toll suffered by the poor is drawing attention to China's growing income gap.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.55
China's booming economy - which has grown at near double digit annual rates for more than 20 years - has given more opportunity to almost all Chinese but created one of the world's most unequal societies.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.56
Hundreds of millions of Chinese survive on a few hundred dollars a year while China's cities harbor pockets of extreme wealth complete with luxury stores and gated villa communities.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.57
Those contrasts will be striking during the Olympics, for which Beijing has spent a record $37 billion, including $417 million for a national stadium known as the "Bird's Nest."
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.58
"The government should divert some of the resources from the shiny Bird's Nest and other expensive projects" to improve rural infrastructure, said Wong, who recently held the presidency of the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers.
NW_NYT_ENG_0208_2008_0517.59
"It is an issue of redistributing resources from the more prosperous provinces to the poorer provinces, from the shiny new projects to schools and hospitals," he said.

NW_PRI_ENG_0140_2000_1012.8
No one should doubt our resolve to remain a force for peace and for stability and no one should assume that they can force us to retreat.
NW_PRI_ENG_0140_2000_1012.9
No one should assume they can attack us with impunity.

The Cole had just arrived in the harbor for a refueling stop.

The bodies of 2 more American sailors were recovered today from the USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden.
NW_PRI_ENG_0141_2000_1018.2
US officials are on the scene and continuing their investigations into the explosion that killed 17 crewmembers on board the Cole last Thursday.
NW_PRI_ENG_0141_2000_1018.3
Today there are reports that police in Aden questioned the landlord of an apartment where bomb-making equipment was found and whose occupants may have carried out the suicide attack against the warship.
NW_PRI_ENG_0141_2000_1018.4
Also today at the Cole's homeport in Norfolk, Virginia, President Clinton led a memorial service for those who died aboard the Cole.
NW_PRI_ENG_0141_2000_1018.5
The service began with the playing of the national anthem.
NW_PRI_ENG_0141_2000_1018.6
The President asked all Americans to take a moment to thank the men and women of the military.
NW_PRI_ENG_0141_2000_1018.7
Today we honor our finest young people, fallen soldiers who rose to freedom's challenge.
NW_PRI_ENG_0141_2000_1018.8
We mourn their loss, celebrate their lives, and offer the love and prayers of a grateful nation to their families.
NW_PRI_ENG_0141_2000_1018.9
Mr. Clinton mentioned the name of each of the 17 victims and praised the courage and character of the men and women who serve in the armed forces.
NW_PRI_ENG_0141_2000_1018.10
And he delivered this clear message for those who carry out attacks on members of US military.
NW_PRI_ENG_0141_2000_1018.11
For those who attacked them we say you will not found the safe harbor.
NW_PRI_ENG_0141_2000_1018.12
We will find you and justice will prevail.
NW_PRI_ENG_0141_2000_1018.13
America will not stop standing guard for peace, or freedom, or stability in the Middle East and around the world.
NW_PRI_ENG_0141_2000_1018.14
At the end of the somber ceremony, President Clinton asked everyone to join him in a moment of silence followed by the Navy Hymn and Taps.

Britain's going to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea.
NW_PRI_ENG_0142_2000_1019.2
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook made the announcement on his arrival in the South Korean capital, Seoul.
NW_PRI_ENG_0142_2000_1019.3
But Cook says establishing ties with North Korea doesn't mean London will turn a blind eye to human rights abuses in the country.
NW_PRI_ENG_0142_2000_1019.4
We have diplomatic relations around the world, we are going to find out who is a human rights breaker, we have very deep and very real concerns.
NW_PRI_ENG_0142_2000_1019.5
The advantage of having diplomatic relations is that we can have a direct dialogue in which we can raise these concerns and express our deep anxiety for the need of improvement in them.
NW_PRI_ENG_0142_2000_1019.6
Cook says the South Korean leadership is keen on international help in bringing its northern neighbor in from the cold.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.1
Britain said today that it is normalizing relations with North Korea.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.2
British Prime Minister Tony Blair called the decision a historic breakthrough.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.3
It comes just days ahead of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's trip to the North Korean capital Pyongyang.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.4
Britain's foreign minister Robin Cook, who made the announcement, said opening diplomatic links could help ease tensions between North and South Korea, technically the two countries are still at war.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.5
Germany said today that it also plans to normalize relations with Pyongyang,

Selig Harrison is a Korean affairs specialist at the Century Foundation in Washington DC.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.7
Mr. Harrison, Britain, Italy, prior to that Australia, the Philippines now and apparently Germany all bringing the most secretive state into the fold.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.8
How about the United States, where does that leave us?
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.9
Well, I think President Clinton will get some good political cover.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.10
From what Britain has done, if he goes to Pyongyang, as is now being discussed, Secretary Albright is going to go, the number two man in North Korea was in Washington last week.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.11
Things are moving, what's particularly important is that Britain has not attached any conditions.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.12
The United States has imposed a number of conditions on normalizing with North Korea.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.13
The most important of them is that it renounce its missile program and its nuclear weapons program, or rather reach agreements on limiting and possibly ending them both, and as of now we are not in a position to normalize relations with North Korea just like that.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.14
We will want negotiations on some of these contested issues.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.15
Well let me ask you more about America's interest now and Britain's move, I mean how do you make sense of what's happening, especially if Britain was involved in a war with North Korea as obviously was the United States, and until recently North Korea was considered by the US a rogue nation.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.16
It is still shrouded in secrecy, as we said, including in its nuclear weapons program.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.17
Are you trusting of these newly forced alliances, do you consider what Britain is doing either reckless or ill advanced?
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.18
No.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.19
And I don't think it is an alliance really, it is just conducting diplomatic interchange with them.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.20
It is not even clear how soon Britain is going to have a mission in Pyongyang.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.21
And so I think it certainly isn't reckless to establish diplomatic relations, and I think indeed it is a very healthy thing because the present leadership of Kim Jong Il, son of the late General You , he has been trying to open up to the outside world.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.22
He doesn't want to reform his internal economic system or political controls.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.23
On the other hand he needs western capital, he needs supportive international agencies to deal with tremendous economic problems that North Korea has had since the end of the cold war, when they lost their Russian and Chinese economic subsidies.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.24
So that trend of North Korea opening up to the outside, it seems to be, it should be encouraged.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.25
So then as North Korea opens up more and more, what are the possible repercussions down the road for the nearly 40,000 American troops who remain in South Korea?
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.26
Well, North Korea's attitude has been that if the United States and North Korea are friends and the North Koreans don't feel threatened, they wont object to some US forces remaining in the Korean peninsula in a new role.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.27
That is to say, if they are going to be there as allies of South Korea against North Korea, then the North Koreans don't want them there, they will keep putting on the pressure for the US to get the forces out.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.28
The North Koreans are certainly not going to end their missile program, if the US continues to maintain some aspects of its military presence in the Korean peninsula such as its aircraft.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.29
So I think they are going to ask for military concessions in order to do what we want them to do regarding missiles, but I think that the assumption that this improvement in ties between North and South and between North Korea and other countries is going to lead to the complete withdrawal of the US from Korea in the near future, certainly I don't think at all, are.
NW_PRI_ENG_0143_2000_1019.30
Mr. Harrison, thank you very much for speaking with us.

Libyan leader Colonel Gadaffi can be prosecuted in France over the bombing of a French airliner in which a 170 people were killed.

That's the ruling of a court in Paris.
NW_PRI_ENG_0146_2000_1020.3
It rejected an appeal that as a serving head of state Gadaffi should be immune from prosecution.

The lawyer representing the victims' families Francoise Rudetski is hailing the decision as a victory.

Putting aside a half century of acrimony, Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright met today with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.4
Part of the purpose of this historic visit is to lay the groundwork for a possible trip to North Korea by President Clinton before his term ends.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.5
Albright's visit to Pyongyang is the first by a high level US official since the communist state was established in 1948.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.6
Kong Dan Oh is a Korean expert who has just written a book called 'North Korea through the Looking Glass'.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.7
She is now in the South Korean capital of Seoul.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.8
We know that the visit is making big news there in Seoul.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.9
Can you tell us what is being reported about the meeting between the two sides from the South Korean perspective?
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.10
Well, when I look at about six major daily newspapers, basically the top news was Madeleine Albright meeting with the Chairman Kim Jong Il.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.11
And basically that indeed this is a very historic event, and some kind of euphoria and very positive upbeat feeling.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.12
But at the same time, the reports are basically telling the importance of this meeting that is that they have to talk about the very critical security matter issues such as missile and nuke.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.13
But nonetheless, the meeting was very crucial, so I think all in all, it was a very positive beginning.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.14
And how much of South Korea as you mentioned is bordering on euphoria, get this new relationship with Pyongyang and at the visit by Secretary of State Albright?
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.15
I know that you have taken a more cautious approach, and I wonder if that applies to Secretary Albright's visit in general?
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.16
Do you believe that the US is doing the right thing?
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.17
Or is perhaps the United States, in your view, moving too quickly to try and patch things up?
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.18
I am kind of taking a slightly cautious approach, simply because if Madam Albright is there, without the really thinking down the road some kind of strategic consequences of this meeting, simply because we are interested in seeing this gentleman and maybe before our term is over, let me meet you.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.19
I think that kind of simple approach to be wrong.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.20
But if she understands importance of this meeting and further brings up substance of issue to be resolved between the North Korea and the United States, I think that is very desirable.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.21
What you're saying is that you feel that the part of the impetus of the North is influenced by the fact that the United States has a presidential election just a couple of weeks away.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.22
I think that is a definitely correct statement, provided that maybe the Republican candidate, Mr. Bush to be elected.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.23
North Korea was very, very scared that Mr. Bush would take a much more hawkish and conservative approach.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.24
So before this Clinton administration comes to be over, they would like to lay down the ground rules and kind of create some kind of positive improvement to deal with the United States.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.25
And obviously one of the most important agendas for tomorrow is to discuss the possibilities of President Clinton's next visit sometime in November.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.26
I know that you have concerns about how a potential visit by President Clinton might be portrayed within North Korea itself.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.27
Why is that a concern of yours?
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.28
My fundamental belief is that Kim Jong Il has not really made his mind or made a decision to push the reforms, even in the session of 1978 Chinese reform that was taken by Deng Xiaoping.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.29
He is now gambling, he is trying, but he has not really changed his manner or his policy whatsoever.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.30
His economy and his society's politics is really getting in real deep trouble.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.31
He has to show his power and he's been telling his people that I am the true leader and the world is afraid of us.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.32
All the imperialist capitalist is afraid of us.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.33
That we are the center of the universe.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.34
Without the North Korea, the globe is not existing.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.35
Let me show you that I am the true leader and they will come to our country to pay visit, courtesy visit for me.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.36
And so now Putin visited, President Kim visited, Jiang Zemin will visit next year and the President Clinton will go.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.37
Domestic consumption of this visit will be immense, without changing any policy toward the freedom of proliferation .
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.38
Is it really possible with the kind of close watch that the outside world is now going to be invited to give to North Korea, that Kim Jong Il could actually not change a thing in terms of his policies, internally or externally?
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.39
I am exactly wondering like you, and I think that there is a maybe the possibility actually is going up.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.40
So I don't object really any of these like U.K. normalization, you know.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.41
I don't have any objection.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.42
But only when the leaders and the elite, the policy elite, is aware of that what they are bringing and what they are negotiating and how they would like to have an impact on North Korean society, I think that's the important key question.
NW_PRI_ENG_0147_2000_1023.43

American spy suspect Edmund Pope took the stand again today in a Moscow courtroom.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.4
The former naval intelligence officer faces charges of stealing secret designs for a high-speed Russian torpedo system.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.5
Pope denies acting illegally and President Clinton and Secretary Of State Madeleine Albright have called for his release on health grounds but Russian prosecutors are pressing ahead as The World's Nenad Sebek reports from Moscow.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.6
The trial was suspended earlier in the week because of Pope's poor health.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.7
Pope has a history of bone cancer but a doctor working for the FSB, the Russian security service, pronounced Pope fit enough to stand trial today.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.8
The proceedings are held behind closed doors and Pope's lawyer said today that his client is still very weak and that he wants a new interpreter, says the current one works for the same agency that has charged Pope.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.9
The lawyer Pavel Astakhov says his client is innocent when it comes to espionage.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.10
The whole case as Astakhov claims is an exercise in politics.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.11
This is the first time in almost 40 years that a foreign national is being tried for espionage.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.12
It's quite blatant.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.13
Officials from the security force, which used to be the KGB, are openly boasting about taking an American citizen to court.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.14
Way back in 1961 US military pilot Garry Powers was tried and sentenced but later on exchanged for a captured Soviet spy.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.15
But Powers was caught red-handed.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.16
His U2 spy plane was brought down by Soviet Air Defenses.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.17
Pope was arrested as he was trying to purchase blue prints for what he says is a 10-year-old underwater propulsion system or as the prosecutions claims ultra modern, secret Russian torpedoes.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.18
Former Russian Army Intelligence Officer, Vitaly Schlykov says Pope could easily have been a victim of the Russian obsession with secrets.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.19
We have of course a secrecy culture in this country for decades and decades and reminisce of it are coming to the surface in this case.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.20
The laws on secrecy are still intact from the times of the Soviet Union.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.21
Guilty or not, Pope is being held under a very harsh regime in the Moscow Lefortovo prison where his wife Sherry visited him last week.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.22
We took two pictures of our grandson and they won't let him keep the pictures and I took a coat and gloves and they wouldn't let him have those, but we did get to embrace and we did get to talk about our family for one hour.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.23
Prison rules say that an inmate can only receive approved gifts on the first and third Thursday in a month.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.24
And Sherry Pope's short-term visa didn't enable her to stay that long.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.25
She says she even appealed to the Russian President.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.26
Ed's mother and I both wrote letters to President to ask him to please take into consideration that Ed is 54 years old and that we want him home.

Military intelligence analyst Vitaly Schlykov says Putin is probably caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to the American's trail.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.28
I'm sure that it came unexpected for Putin.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.29
He wouldn't have approved on a case like this because politically it is very harmful but he came from the ranks of the FSB himself.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.30
He has to pretend that he is sticking to his guns in this case.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.31
In Schlykov's opinion, Pope is likely to get convicted.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.32
But he believes that immediately after the sentencing Pope is likely to be pardoned by Moscow.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.33
US Congressman John Peterson, who has been championing Pope's cause, says he fears that might be too late for Pope.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.34
The main thing we have been pushing for months is health care.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.35
Earlier we had asked for an American doctor to see him.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.36
When they continued to say no then we found Russian doctors.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.37
The judge delayed the trial for a day and a half so we could furnish her with a list of doctors and hospitals in Moscow and after we provided that information she said no.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.38
Pope's lawyer Pavel Astakhov says that what the authorities here call medical care is a joke.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.39
In Pope's case medical control means everyday testing for his suspected cancer.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.40
What they do here is take his blood pressure and temperature.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.41
The very least they could do is take blood tests and bone marrow tests.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.42
The court has even rejected our demand for medical expertise to establish whether he is fit to stand trial.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.43
As Strakovs says he does not trust the Judge Nina Barkova at all.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.44
He says she has rejected almost every one of his 40 objections and suggestions during the trail so far.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.45
Strakovs is now trying to arrange for fresh witnesses for his defense of Edmund Pope, but is not hopeful that even that will be granted by the court.
NW_PRI_ENG_0148_2000_1102.46
For The World, this is Nenad Sebek in Moscow.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.1
In Moscow, today there was a dramatic plot twist in a real life courtroom drama.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.2
A lawyer for US spy suspect, Edmond Pope said that the main prosecution witness has retracted his testimony.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.3
According to Pope's attorney the witness said he provided the evidence under pressure from the Russian Secret Service.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.4
Ever since Pope was arrested 7 months ago, the American businessmen has denied charges that he was gathering secret information on a new high-speed Russian torpedo.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.5
The World's Nenad Sebek is following the trial in Moscow.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.6
Nenad, go back and tell us just how we got here?
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.7
Who is Edwin Pope and why is he on trial in Russia?
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.8
Well, Edwin Pope is a retired American intelligence officer and that's sort of speaks against him when it comes to the Russian public and certainly the Russian court.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.9
He has claimed that he is now just an innocent businessman, who was dealing with the Russian businesses orbit in the Defense Industry.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.10
He has, however, claimed that he is only dealing with the de-classified military material and that when it comes to these torpedoes that we are talking about, that he was buying an underwater propulsion system, which is 10-years old.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.11
What the Russian prosecution is claiming is that Pope was actually after ultramodern secret high-speed Russian torpedoes.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.12
Okay, so tell us what happened in the trial this morning and bring in this professor from one of Moscow's elite universities who is a key witness?
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.13
The big news of today was that Pope's attorney distributed to journalists this morning a letter, which he says was written by Anatoly Babkin, who is a Professor at Moscow's Bauman Technical Institute, who until now was considered to be the main witness for the prosecution.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.14
He says that he gave that evidence under pressure having had a grave heart condition proceeding a heart attack.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.15
Professor Babkin says that he never actually met Edwin Pope face to face, nor has he given him any kind of sensitive information, therefore, his former testimony is to be considered as not corresponding to reality says this letter by Professor Babkin.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.16
However, the court today again, this is what we were told by Pope's lawyer, has decided not to accept this change in testimony.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.17
The court said that Professor Babkin had ample opportunities to appear in the court.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.18
What is not clear at this moment is that whether it will allow a personal appearance by Professor Babkin, in which he could sort of say what he said in this letter.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.19
Then I would assume that the Professor is still ailing.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.20
I mean, is he able to take the stand, is there any indication that he will be asked to?
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.21
No he is not able to take the stand at the moment.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.22
He is recuperating after a heart attack, but Pope's lawyer has said that court session could actually take place in the apartment of Professor Babkin.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.23
We still have to wait and see whether the court will accept that.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.24
So how important is this evidence?
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.25
I mean how pivotal a figure is he?
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.26
Is he providing evidence of no one else can?
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.27
Well.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.28
From what we have heard so far, this is supposed to be like a key witness, a very important witness, but then the first reaction came from the FSB, the Federal Security Bureau, which is the former KGB, they are the ones who are prosecuting Pope.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.29
Their spokesman said today that their evidence is far from being based only on Babkin's testimony.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.30
He said that FSB has evidence given by other witnesses and experts, as well as, written documents and videos.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.31
This is not, what would know as a standards of American style trial certainly, first of all of the proceedings are conducted entirely in secret.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.32
What is the defense attorney for Edmond Pope saying about the conduct in the trial?
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.33
Well.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.34
He is very unhappy with the main judge.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.35
Pope is not being tried by Jury.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.36
He has been tried by panel of judges headed by judge Nina Barkova and what we have heard from the defense attorney Pavel Astakhov is that she has rejected almost every single one of over 40 objections and suggestions that he has so far submitted during the case.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.37
He is very unhappy with the way she has been conducting the whole case and also with the fact that she has denied Edmund Pope the proper medical attention that he has asked for.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.38
And what has like that it happened should Edmond Pope get convicted.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.39
Would he actually serve time?
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.40
Well.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.41
Most of the people I have spoken here believe that that would not be the case, that since the case is already being brought to court that he is most likely to get convicted, but will then afterwards be pardoned either by the president or the parliament, and then sent back home for reasons of ill health, but most people here do expect a conviction at the end of this trial.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.42
It was Nenad Sebek in Moscow talking to us about the espionage trial in Moscow of American Edmond Pope.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.43
Thank you very much Nenad.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.44
You are welcome Lisa.
NW_PRI_ENG_0149_2000_1108.45
This is PRI, Public Radio International.
NW_PRI_ENG_0150_2000_1206.1
A court in Moscow has convicted American businessman Edmund Pope of spying and sentenced him to 20 years in prison.
NW_PRI_ENG_0150_2000_1206.2
Pope, a retired naval officer from Pennsylvania, was accused of illegally obtaining secret blueprints for a high speed Russian torpedo.
NW_PRI_ENG_0150_2000_1206.3
He argued throughout the case that the information he obtained was already available to the public.
NW_PRI_ENG_0150_2000_1206.4
The White House denounced the court action calling it unjustified and wrong.
NW_PRI_ENG_0150_2000_1206.5
Pope's wife and his lawyers have also called for his release on health grounds, saying that he suffers from a rare form of bone cancer, which may have returned during his eight months in a Russian prison.
NW_PRI_ENG_0150_2000_1206.6
Corey Flintoff, NPR News, Washington.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.1
A court in Moscow today sentenced American businessman Edmund Pope to 20 years in jail.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.2
Pope, a former naval officer, was found guilty of collecting secret blueprints for a high speed Russian torpedo.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.3
Pope denied the charges and he had a powerful ally.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.4
President Clinton had appealed for clemency for Pope on health grounds and had brought the case up with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but Mr. Clinton's pleas apparently fell on deaf ears.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.5
The Russian court today handed down the maximum sentence.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.6
Still, The World's Nenad Sebek in Moscow says that Pope has not yet exhausted his legal options.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.7
He has got 7 days to appeal this particular sentence.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.8
There is also the possibility of asking for a presidential pardon, Pope has actually indeed already done that.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.9
It's just that his wife said that she has not heard neither from the President nor his office.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.10
His health is a big issue as well, isn't it?
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.11
Yes, Pope has been suffering from a rare bone cancer in the past and he has been consistently complaining about his health ever since last Spring when he was taken in to the Lefortovo prison.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.12
The thing is that he has not been allowed any access to American doctors and even to Russian doctors of his own choosing.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.13
He has been examined by the Russian doctors in the Lefortovo prison but they have just said that his complaints are unfounded and that it might be a case of severe rheumatism or something like that.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.14
They are not sort of allowing the possibility of his bone cancer reoccurring.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.15
One of the things that has been said here is that Mr. Pope may have run afoul of a changing mood in Russia about what kind of military and security information might be made available to the west for business purposes.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.16
That his intentions were innocent to begin with, but the times changed and what he did began to look more and more like espionage.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.17
That is certainly a possibility but we don't know actually precisely because we don't even know what the initial charges are.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.18
The whole trial was held behind closed doors and the details of the accusations against Pope have never been fully released.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.19
We know that the prosecution claimed that he was trying to purchase secret plans for a top-secret high-speed Russian torpedo.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.20
He was claiming all the time, and his lawyer was saying that he was sort of trying to purchase plans that had been actually out in the open but we do not know the precise legals of that.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.21
That is one of the possibilities.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.22
Another thing which is mentioned here is that Pope simply ran afoul of a new trend in Russia which was a trend where the security services were getting the upper hand where they were trying to prove that they are actually doing their job, that they are catching spies, that they are getting convictions.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.23
We have, for example, today's reaction by General Alexander Zdanovich, he is the head of the FSB support programs.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.24
He was very, very brief in his comments after the sentencing.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.25
He said that the court has said that FSB investigators have acted correctly and in accordance with the law and he says, "Russia has its secrets, we will do our best to protect them".
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.26
Maybe Pope simply ran afoul of such attempts by the Russian Security Services to show that they are doing their job.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.27
Putin, on the one hand, is certainly trying to show that he is in charge and that no one from the outside is going to get away with anything.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.28
By the same token though he is not eager to run afoul of the United States and the State Department is very upset.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.29
Is there any possibility that Mr. Putin might consider a pardon?
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.30
I would say there is a very strong possibility of that.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.31
We know that President Clinton has spoken to Vladimir Putin about this when they met last time, and certainly the Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has brought up the issue a number of times, as has the State Department indeed with the Russian Foreign Ministry.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.32
In a curious way the sentencing of Edmund Pope might be the beginning of an end of this ordeal for him.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.33
Because now that there is a sentence, once the judiciary process is started, once the FSB brought him to trial everybody here expected that the trial will end and that it will end with a conviction.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.34
But now that this judicial process is over there is a very, very strong likelihood, that's the feeling here in Moscow that President Vladimir Putin might pardon Edmund Pope.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.35
There is a good reason for that, his ill health.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.36
So it would be a nice humanitarian gesture and a way of offering a friendly hand to the west and to the United States in particular.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.37
The World's Nenad Sebek in Moscow.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.38
Thanks a lot, Nenad.
NW_PRI_ENG_0151_2000_1206.39
You are welcome.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.1
The United States is hoping that Russia's President Vladimir Putin will follow the advice of his special commission and pardon Edmund Pope.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.2
This week the American businessman began serving a 20-year prison sentence in Moscow after being convicted of spying.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.3
Specifically Russian prosecutors charged that Pope had stolen secrets relating to a high-speed Russian torpedo.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.4
Pope denied the charges and Washington backed him up.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.5
Marsha Lipman is Editor of Moscow based news magazine 'Itogi'.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.6
Marsha, did the Presidential Pardons Commission give any reason for their decision?
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.7
It gave several reasons.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.8
I am not sure if those were the formal reasons but members of the commission have been interviewed today by various outlets and they say that they were afraid of the spy mania rising in Russia, that they thought it was really suspicious to them that Edmund Pope was sentenced to the maximum term, whereas the article of the law had 10 to 20 years.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.9
He was sentenced to 20, even though according to the members of the Pardon Commission, the evidence that was presented by the prosecution was far from quotient.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.10
They also said this court did not give the lawyers for the defense due procedure.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.11
The court listened to the defense much less than it did to the prosecution.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.12
Much of this sounds less like a pardon and more like a criticism of the number of institutions that Mr. Putin also has to show some support of, including his court system and his police and his prosecutors.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.13
How is he going to respond to this and when?
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.14
I don't think anybody knows and I don't think anybody will know until President Putin has responded.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.15
It is his decision.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.16
According to the Russian law the Pardon Commission, after it has made its decision, sends it to the President and it's up to him whether to endorse it or not to say no.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.17
One last question for you, Marsha.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.18
He does have a lot to balance doesn't he, President Putin?
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.19
Not only the institutions I mentioned but the need to keep things somehow free of tension.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.20
Is this case likely to strain US-Russian relations?
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.21
I'm afraid it might.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.22
Recently the Russian policy toward the US has fallen into a line where Russia tries to demonstrate force it once had but no longer does.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.23
It wants to put an end to what is regarded by the current Russian government as humiliation of the past years.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.24
There were numerous attempts to be a source of minor troubles even though Russia can no longer be a source of scare to the west and among such instances there were several, there was just recently flying over by Russian military planes over Kitty Hawk, an American warship.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.25
There is also a scandal that erupted over Russia's declaration that it will sell weapons to Iran, contrary to the earlier made agreement.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.26
Such examples are quite a few already, some of them are combined with material profits for Russia but not necessarily.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.27
Marsha Lipman is Editor of the Moscow based news magazine 'Itogi'.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.28
Marsha, thank you very much for speaking with us.
NW_PRI_ENG_0152_2000_1208.29
Pleasure.
NW_PRI_ENG_0153_2000_1214.1
Edmund Pope tasted freedom today for the first time in more than eight months.
NW_PRI_ENG_0153_2000_1214.2
Pope is the American businessman who was convicted last week on spying charges and sentenced to 20 years in a Russian prison.
NW_PRI_ENG_0153_2000_1214.3
He denied any wrongdoing.
NW_PRI_ENG_0153_2000_1214.4
Russian President Vladimir Putin pardoned him for health reasons.
NW_PRI_ENG_0153_2000_1214.5
Pope was flown to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.
NW_PRI_ENG_0153_2000_1214.6
He will spend the next several days at the medical center there before he returns home with his wife Sherry.
NW_PRI_ENG_0153_2000_1214.7
Pope was in remission from a rare form of bone cancer when he was arrested in Russia.
NW_PRI_ENG_0153_2000_1214.8
Doctors will examine him for signs that the cancer may have come back while he awaiting trial in a Russian jail.
NW_PRI_ENG_0153_2000_1214.9
A spokeswoman said that Pope was suffering from malnutrition and high blood pressure.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.1
Congratulations from foreign leaders poured into the governor's mansion in Texas today.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.2
The messages were addressed to President-elect George W. Bush and they all contained words of welcome and optimism.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.3
But truth be told for most international figures, Bush is something of an unknown.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.4
He has traveled little and his diplomatic experience is limited to contacts with Mexican officials during his tenure as governor.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.5
The World's Jeb Sharp has been hunting down clues to the foreign policy of the incoming administration.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.6
A few broad foreign policy themes emerged during the campaign.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.7
Chief among them are debate over the wisdom of US intervention.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.8
Bush clearly favors limiting the use of American force and troops to solve conflicts overseas.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.9
Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace says that view is consistent with the philosophies of two top Bush advisors, Russia expert Condoleezza Rice and retired General Colin Powell.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.10
Certainly, Condoleezza Rice, certainly Colin Powell who I expect, the two of them to be the dominant force in the next administration on foreign policy.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.11
I certainly think they believe they would like to not intervene as much as the Clinton administration or I guess the previous Bush administration did.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.12
In fact, Condoleezza Rice who is slated to become Bush's National Security Advisor has already said she'd like to see US troops pulled home from the Balkans.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.13
But, Robert Kagan says its one thing for Bush's advisors to state a philosophy, its quite another to implement it.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.14
I think they may find the world has a way of intruding itself and that it won't be that easy to pull forces out of the Balkans for instance, without destroying the NATO alliance.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.15
After Rice made some comments about having a new division of labor, I think that was the word she used with regard to NATO and peacekeeping issues, there was a riot in Europe and the real fears that the United States was getting ready to withdraw from the continent and I think they had to walk that back a little bit.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.16
The Balkans is just one example where the Bush administration will have to walk a fine line in delineating a different approach from that of Mr. Clinton.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.17
The foreign policy challenges facing the next President are daunting.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.18
The Mid East peace process is on hold with Israelis and Palestinians practically at war.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.19
The sanctions regime against Iraq has unraveled.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.20
Russia and China are alarmed at the prospect of America beefing up its missile defenses.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.21
India and Pakistan, now nuclear powers are locked in a dangerous standoff.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.22
Stability in East Asia is another pressing concern.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.23
But despite the challenges, Northeast Asia expert Bates Gil of the Brookings Institution is encouraged by what he knows of the Bush foreign team.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.24
One of the most interesting aspects of the new likely team under the Bush administration is first of all, extensive experience in defense and military affairs.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.25
Secondly, it's easy to point to a number of persons who will have leading positions who have had extensive experience in East Asian affairs.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.26
So you have a combination of depth of experience plus an understanding of the region.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.27
Both of which will come in handy if there is a crisis with China over Taiwan or relations with North Korea deteriorate.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.28
In such a crisis, Bush is likely to rely on the advice of government officials who cut their teeth during the cold war.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.29
Some critics like Gore advisor Bruce Jentelson worry that the Bush team will be out of step with today's issues.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.30
Issues related to globalization, global public health, technology, and those challenges.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.31
Yet in my view a truly realistic policy cannot be based only on the old agenda issues, really has to address these new agenda issues as well.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.32
But no matter what sort of expertise Bush's international affairs people bring to the White House, they won't be able to fully control what happens on their watch.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.33
Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace says each President's foreign policy is ultimately shaped by events, not theories.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.34
Really, most of a President's foreign policy comes down to how they respond to specific events.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.35
Bill Clinton did not come in to office intending to send troops to Haiti and the Balkans, and events sort of forced his hand and I think that, you know, the truth is Bush administration comes in with certain kinds of prejudices, but we will have to see how they respond to crises.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.36
And the only thing that I'm confident of is that there will be crises.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.37
President-elect Bush is expected to begin naming his top cabinet picks in the next few days.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.38
Those choices will mean everything when the first crisis rolls around.
NW_PRI_ENG_0154_2000_1214.39
For The World, I'm Jeb Sharp.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.1
In 1998, the United States voted against the creation of the World's first permanent International War Crimes Court.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.2
President Clinton still has a chance to sign the treaty creating the Court before a final deadline this Sunday.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.3
Advocates are pressing him to do just that, but Conservatives in Congress and Pentagon officials don't want the US to join the treaty.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.4
The World's Jeb Sharp explains why.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.5
Jesse Helms, the Conservative and powerful Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has made it clear the Rome's statuette would be dead on arrival if it were brought to Congress for ratification.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.6
But proponents of the permanent International Criminal Court would still like to see President Clinton at least sign the treaty before the New Year's eve deadline.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.7
Richard Dicker of Human Rights Watch says Clinton's signature would be an important symbolic gesture.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.8
What he will accomplish is making a clear statement that the United States not only in the former Yugoslavia, not only in Rwanda, not only in Cambodia, not only in Sierra Leone, where the administration has supported efforts at justice, but worldwide the United States supports the rule of law and supports holding those accused of genocide to account under the highest standards of due process.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.9
But the opposition here in the United States is intense.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.10
It comes mainly from the Pentagon where US military officials fear the Court will leave Americans vulnerable to politically motivated prosecutions.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.11
Negotiators have tried to include safeguards in the treaty to address those fears, but stop short of exempting US personnel from prosecution.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.12
John Bolton of the American Enterprise Institute shares the Pentagon's objections.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.13
I think there is every prospect such a court and its prosecutor would be highly politicized and the principal target of a court like this might well turn out to be the United States or Israel or other countries like that.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.14
Bolton says that almost happened at the War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, when Chief Prosecutor Carla Delponte briefly contemplated an investigation of NATO's bombing campaign against Serbia in 1999.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.15
But proponents of the court say it's healthy for the United States and its allies to come under the same scrutiny as other countries.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.16
Richard Dicker of Human Rights Watch says Delponte's handling of the NATO case was exemplary.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.17
Carla Delponte was acting as any responsible prosecutor must when she receives credible allegations of wrongdoing.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.18
She looked into those allegations and then after an appropriate investigation she dismissed them.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.19
Richard Dicker says President Clinton should keep the promise he made to the Rwandan people in 1998 when he told survivors of the genocide there the United States would support the International Court.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.20
But John Bolton of the American Enterprise Institute says a Clinton signature in the face of stiff domestic opposition would be meaningless.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.21
I think it's a symbolic act that doesn't achieve much, but I don't think anybody internationally should think that whatever President Clinton does will have the slightest impact on the next administration.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.22
Despite American objections, the International Criminal Court enjoys wide support worldwide and among major US allies.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.23
131 countries have signed the treaty, 7 today and 25 have ratified it.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.24
60 nations in all must ratify the treaty for the International Criminal Court to come into existence.
NW_PRI_ENG_0155_2000_1228.25
That's expected to happen, with or without US support, in 2002.

I can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would invest in the airline industry.
NW_QIA_ENG_0156_2005_0109.2
Please, someone tell me a group companies facing more serious problems than the legacy airline carriers (Delta, US Airways, Continental, American, Northwestern, United).
NW_QIA_ENG_0156_2005_0109.3
High fuel costs, insane pension obligations, and a highly paid, specialized workforce.
NW_QIA_ENG_0156_2005_0109.4
To this list of woes, we add a whole slew of competitors with much lower cost structures.
NW_QIA_ENG_0156_2005_0109.5
I admit I've already taken advantage of the lower fares announced last week to book a business trip but these next few years are not going to be pretty for some of these companies.
NW_QIA_ENG_0156_2005_0109.6
Unfortunately, the pain is not limited to these companies.
NW_QIA_ENG_0156_2005_0109.7
Pittsburgh, one of US Airway's hubs, built up its airport complete with a sprawling retail complex in the terminal.
NW_QIA_ENG_0156_2005_0109.8
Now US Airways has reduced flights out of Pittsburgh by 28% since January of 2004 and is in real danger of folding completely.
NW_QIA_ENG_0156_2005_0109.9
These shiny new airports are usually financed by long-term bonds that still have to paid off.
NW_QIA_ENG_0156_2005_0109.10
..but not by the airlines.
NW_QIA_ENG_0156_2005_0109.11
This is an industry looking for a sustainable strategy.
NW_QIA_ENG_0156_2005_0109.12
Southwest and JetBlue were the only major airlines to earn a profit in 2004 but who knows what will be happening in another five years.
NW_QIA_ENG_0156_2005_0109.13
So I will thankfully accept the low fares, bemoan the loss of food on flights, and watch these companies parade in and out of bankruptcy.

NW_TTR_ENG_0157_2005_0223.17
When I was fulltime in radio I made a little less, but I got quite a few remotes, which make up for not getting a topnotch salary.

A dining room set.

New clothes.

But I want family more.
NW_TTR_ENG_0157_2005_0223.36
I think part of the draw of the other stuff is I could get it now.

At least 54 soldiers and 50 guerillas have died in clashes around the northwestern cities of Bagado and Dabeiba.
NW_VOA_ENG_0159_2000_1020.5
Nearly all of the buildings, government buildings in those two cities, have been reportedly destroyed.
NW_VOA_ENG_0159_2000_1020.6
The clashes began Wednesday, when the rebel revolutionary armed forces of Colombia launched attacks on a number of northwestern towns.

The scientist, an expert on the torpedo and a defense witness at the trial of businessman Edmond Pope said he had often used the torpedo information for his research and had spoken openly about it.

In Yemen, a bomb threat has forced the tightening of security at the hotel housing US investigators probing the attack on the USS Cole.
NW_VOA_ENG_0162_2000_1026.2
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters the situation caused the Secretary of Defense to call US field commanders.
NW_VOA_ENG_0162_2000_1026.3
The Secretary held a video conference call with all the commanders in chiefs, as well as the service chiefs and the service secretaries and the topic was force protection.
NW_VOA_ENG_0162_2000_1026.4
The hotel has been hosting scores of investigators who are looking into the apparent suicide bomb attack on the navy destroyer that killed 17 US sailor two weeks ago.
NW_VOA_ENG_0163_2000_1029.1
The US Navy destroyer damaged apparently by a terrorist bomb while refueling at the Red Sea port Aden has begun its journey back to the States for repair.
NW_VOA_ENG_0163_2000_1029.2
As Dave Gavlak reports, the USS Cole was towed out of the Aden harbor to awaiting Norwegian transport ship, that will actually carry the damaged destroyer home.

The American national anthem played as four tug boats pulled the USS Cole slowly out of Yemen's Southern port of Aden.
NW_VOA_ENG_0163_2000_1029.4
The Cole was badly damaged two weeks ago in an apparent suicide bombing that killed 17 US sailors.
NW_VOA_ENG_0163_2000_1029.5
Security was tight as the ship was towed out.
NW_VOA_ENG_0163_2000_1029.6
American and Yemeni patrol boats mounted with machine guns escorted the Cole out to open waters while American helicopters flew overhead.
NW_VOA_ENG_0163_2000_1029.7
Some Yemenis expressed relief to see the ship leave.
NW_VOA_ENG_0163_2000_1029.8
Many locals said they feared the bombing of the ship would serve as an excuse for continued US military presence in the Gulf country.
NW_VOA_ENG_0163_2000_1029.9
Diplomats and analysts have commented that a joint investigation into the attack may in fact strengthen ties between the world super power and the poor, but strategic Arab state.
NW_VOA_ENG_0163_2000_1029.10
US and Yemeni officials say they believe Islamic militants may have carried out the bombing.
NW_VOA_ENG_0163_2000_1029.11
So far two little known Islamic groups have claimed responsibility for the attack.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair arrives in Russia today for talks with Vladimir Putin on security, foreign policy, and economic issues.
NW_VOA_ENG_0166_2000_1121.2
They are also expected to discuss a new Russian proposal for deep cuts in US and Russian long-range missiles.

VOA's Larry James in Moscow.
NW_VOA_ENG_0166_2000_1121.4
The highlight of the one-day visit will be three hours of talks on Tuesday, during which Mr. Blair and Mr. Putin will focus on a wide range of issues including Russia's latest call for cutting the number of strategic nuclear warheads to below 1500.
NW_VOA_ENG_0166_2000_1121.5
President Clinton has said such a deal is possible, but that it will be first necessary to convince Moscow of the merits of America's proposed Missile Defense System.
NW_VOA_ENG_0166_2000_1121.6
The US wants to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty so it can develop such a system.
NW_VOA_ENG_0166_2000_1121.7
Russia believes such a move could spark a new arms race and has threatened to tear up existing weapons agreements and stop disarmament talks if the United States goes ahead.
NW_VOA_ENG_0166_2000_1121.8
On Sunday Mr. Putin called on the Russian parliament to quickly ratify the amended Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty.
NW_VOA_ENG_0166_2000_1121.9
That treaty requires Russia to make further non-nuclear weapons reductions in some areas of the country including breakaway Chechnya.
NW_VOA_ENG_0166_2000_1121.10
President Putin acknowledged that Russia is still violating its commitment in Chechnya, but he said it is only a temporary situation which has the ultimate aim of cutting armaments in the region.
NW_VOA_ENG_0166_2000_1121.11
He also thanked the 29 other signatories to the treaty for their understanding.
NW_VOA_ENG_0166_2000_1121.12
He said Russia is fully behind the agreement that, he said, is an efficient instrument of ensuring security in Europe for years to come.
NW_VOA_ENG_0166_2000_1121.13
The original treaty was signed in 1990 and led to the destruction of thousands of heavy weapons by NATO and the former Warsaw Pact.

Since 1988, the first day of December has been designated by the United Nations as World AIDS Day.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.5
This is the time to disseminate information and faster cooperation in the battle against AIDS, the number one cause of infectious disease in the world.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.6
The picture of the epidemic is bleak.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.7
According to a new UN study, in the past year over five million people have been infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.8
Since the beginning of the epidemic, about 22 million people have died of the disease.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.9
While infections among adults are decreasing, infections among children are increasing.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.10
Many of these cases are in sub-Saharan Africa where infected mothers are transmitting the virus to their babies during delivery.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.11
Africa accounts for more than four-fifths of the world's AIDS-related deaths.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.12
In some African countries, one out of four adults is infected with HIV.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.13
But Eastern Europe has seen the biggest explosion of new infections.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.14
In Russia, the rate of infection has more than doubled this year to 300,000.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.15
South and Southeast Asia are other high-risk areas with five and three quarter million adults and children now living with HIV or AIDS.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.16
In too many places, discussion of AIDS is taboo and the disease is shrouded in mystery and misinformation.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.17
But as the grim statistics make clear, it is critical that the governments and citizens of those nations most affected by AIDS, do their part to recognize the scope of the epidemic and act decisively to confront it.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.18
As President Bill Clinton said, we must work together to break the silence, to fight the stigmatization and protect the rights of those living with HIV and AIDS, and to help those infected find the care and treatment they need.
NW_VOA_ENG_0168_2000_1130.19
We must pledge to stay the course in our crusade until the world is finally freed from the shadow of this devastating epidemic.
NW_VOA_ENG_0169_2000_1205.1
In South Asia, authorities in Bangladesh's Southwestern port of Mongla have called on the Army to control riots that have left at least four people dead and 58 injured.
NW_VOA_ENG_0169_2000_1205.2
Officials say the trouble began when striking dock workers tried to storm the port authority offices and police fired to disperse them.
NW_VOA_ENG_0169_2000_1205.3
The demonstrators are demanding that more people be hired to load and unload goods at the port.
NW_VOA_ENG_0170_2000_1207.1
Beginning early next year, visitors to Yosemite National Park in California will see some changes.
NW_VOA_ENG_0170_2000_1207.2
A new plan is aimed at protecting the giant Sequoia trees, scenic valleys, and waterfalls from the impact of four million tourists a year.
NW_VOA_ENG_0170_2000_1207.3
Under the new plan, visitors will have very limited access to the park by car.
NW_VOA_ENG_0170_2000_1207.4
The 343 million-dollar plan will create a new shuttle bus system to alleviate traffic congestion.
NW_VOA_ENG_0170_2000_1207.5
It will also remove roads from meadows, create more hiking trails, and restore campsites damaged by a 1997 flood.
NW_VOA_ENG_0170_2000_1207.6
Yosemite spokesman Scott Gediman says while these measures have been controversial, the preservation effort will not sacrifice visitor enjoyment.
NW_VOA_ENG_0170_2000_1207.7
And so we certainly do not want to limit access or will not limit access to the National Park, but we need to design the facilities, design parking areas, design the infrastructure in a way that we can handle these large amounts of people.
NW_VOA_ENG_0170_2000_1207.8
Yosemite is not alone in seeking new management strategies to preserve natural areas.
NW_VOA_ENG_0170_2000_1207.9
Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona is putting in a light rail system.
NW_VOA_ENG_0170_2000_1207.10
And Zion National Park in Utah has just established a new shuttle bus system.

President Clinton has urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to order the release on humanitarian grounds of a US businessman convicted of spying.
NW_VOA_ENG_0171_2000_1208.2
A White House spokesman says the two leaders spoke by telephone today, after the Russian government's pardon commission recommended the release of Edmond Pope.
NW_VOA_ENG_0171_2000_1208.3
Earlier, a senior Russian official said Edmond Pope could be home by Christmas.
NW_VOA_ENG_0171_2000_1208.4
The former US naval intelligence officer was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison Wednesday, on charges he illegally obtained a classified information on a Russian torpedo.

Colombia's second largest Marxist rebel army has released forty-two soldiers and police officers.
NW_VOA_ENG_0172_2000_1223.2
Government officials say the National Liberation Army freed the captives today in Northern Colombia.
NW_VOA_ENG_0172_2000_1223.3
The forty-two prisoners were captured two years ago during clashes with the guerilla group.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.1
Hardly a day passes without news photos of the police dragging limp protesters from some building or thoroughfare in one of our cities.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.2
Of recent note are the activities of the pro- and anti-abortionists, anti-nuclear activists, animal rights protesters, college students concerned about racism, anti-apartheid groups, various self-styled "environmentalists" and those dissatisfied with the pace of the war against AIDS.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.3
Maybe he didn't start it, but Mohandas Gandhi certainly provided a recognizable beginning to non-violent civil disobedience as we know it today.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.4
The Mahatma, or "great souled one," instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.5
Unfortunately, according to Webster's Biographical Dictionary, "His policies went beyond his control and resulted . . . in riots and disturbances" and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience "resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.6
I am not a proponent of everything Gandhi did, but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under occupation by a foreign power, and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally affected them.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.7
It is difficult, however, to justify civil disobedience, non-violent or not, where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.8
Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights, there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.9
There may be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.10
The case of Rosa Parks, the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus, comes to mind as an illustration.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.11
But most cases of non-violent civil disobedience are not nearly so benign.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.12
The public has a tendency to equate lawful demonstrations with non-violent civil disobedience.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.13
It is true that both are non-violent, but there is a fundamental difference between them.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.14
Lawful demonstrations, such as peaceful picketing and other assemblages that do not disturb the peace or cause a public nuisance or interfere with the rights of others, are rights guaranteed by any truly free system of government.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.15
Civil disobedience, violent or non-violent, is intentional law breaking.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.16
The subject of this discussion is non-violent civil disobedience; but, before we get on with that, let me make just a few tangential remarks about lawful demonstrations.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.17
They are useful to call public attention to grievances, but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.18
The delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted through bullhorns, militant gestures, accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.19
Civilized discourse and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture abetted by superficial media interviews.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.20
At best, demonstrations are overused and boringly uninformative; at worst, they can become the stimuli that lead to law breaking.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.21
Demonstrations are particularly apt to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.22
Petty criminals and street people looking for excitement attach themselves like remora to the fringes of the crowd and use the protest as an excuse for rock throwing, auto trashing, arson, window breaking, looting, pocket picking and general hooliganism.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.23
Soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in mob mania.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.24
There are better ways to promote a cause.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.25
Where non-violent civil disobedience is the centerpiece, rather than a lawful demonstration that may only attract crime, it is difficult to justify.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.26
Some find no harm in the misdemeanors of trespass, minor property destruction, blocking traffic and the like.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.27
They say these are small prices to pay for galvanizing action for the all-important cause.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.28
The crimes may appear small, but the prices can be huge.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.29
Here are two cases to illustrate.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.30
Assume a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involving a police car.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.31
The protesters lie down in the street, blocking traffic, and will not move until the authorities carry them away.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.32
Assume that someone caught in the jam has a heart attack.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.33
There is no way to get an ambulance in quickly to move him to a hospital.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.34
He dies.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.35
The demonstration was non-violent and involved only a simple misdemeanor, but its impact on that individual was violent and terminal.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.36
Assume that a TV network is airing a celebrity interview program with a live audience.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.37
The politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of rancor amid certain groups.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.38
In a planned protest against his appearance, several members of the studio audience chain themselves in front of the TV cameras in such a way that the program cannot continue.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.39
The network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.40
The demonstrators have been non-violent, but the result of their trespasses has been to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with their dispute.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.41
It might be alleged that TV has done more than its share to popularize and promote non-violent civil disobedience, so the second situation hypothesized above would be simply a case of "chickens coming home to roost."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.42
Or maybe the TV network would lose nothing.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.43
Geraldo or Phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protesters.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.44
Let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only harms other people indirectly, yet does irreparable damage to the nation as a whole.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.45
I am referring to those young men who chose to disobey their country's call to arms during the Vietnam war and fled to Canada or some other sanctuary to avoid combat.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.46
Their cowardly acts of civil disobedience, which they tried to hide under the cloak of outrage at a war they characterized as "immoral," weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who served honorably in that conflict.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.47
Even more at fault are those leaders in and out of government who urged and supported their defections, thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy propagandists.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.48
It is amazing that the ensuing mass executions in Vietnam and Cambodia do not weight more heavily on minds so morally fine-tuned.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.49
Worse, it remained to a well-meaning but naive president of the United States to administer the final infamy upon those who fought and died in Vietnam.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.50
Under the guise of "healing the wounds of the nation," President Carter pardoned thousands of draft evaders, thus giving dignity to their allegations of the war's "immorality."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.51
The precedent having been set, who can complain if future generations called upon to defend the U.S. yield to the temptation to avoid the danger of combat by simply declaring the war immoral and hiding until it is over?
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.52
Finally, I think it important to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.53
Give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law, and no second invitation will be required.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.54
This brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.55
Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause?
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.56
Here is a good rule of thumb: If the movement produced the leader, the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.57
In either case, ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.58
If you have not, it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0173_2006_0331.59
Mr. Agnew was vice president of the U.S. from 1969 until he resigned in 1973.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.1
As the leading candidate for president of his country in next year's election, Mario Vargas Llosa ought to be in an enviable position.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.2
But his country is Peru, where political visibility, especially for a believer in democracy and free enterprise -- a right winger in Latin American eyes -- makes a man a target for assassination.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.3
For almost any Peruvian these days, to show an interest in public office is a heroic gesture; for Mr. Vargas Llosa especially so, since he already has achieved a high position in the world's eyes as a writer.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.4
Published everywhere to universal acclaim, doted on like a movie star in the Hispanic world from Barcelona to Ushuaia, Mr. Vargas Llosa could live comfortably on his royalties and console his political conscience with the thought that Peru is a hopeless mess not of his making and that he already did his best to reform it with his magnificently cinematic novel about the years of military dictatorship of his youth, "Conversation in the Cathedral."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.5
But, after some hesitation, he is back on the stump and also still writing important novels about Peru.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.6
"The Storyteller" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 246 pages, $17.95), splendidly translated by Helen Lane, first appeared in Spanish in 1987 before the Peruvian economy had reached its present state of virtual collapse.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.7
And in any case the story takes place a bit earlier than that, when the guerrilla war in the highlands had not yet made internal travel a gamble with destiny.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.8
Even still, the very first sentence of this fable that weaves together Peru's most advanced and most primitive cultural strands speaks of "my unfortunate country."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.9
The narrator may be talking about the depredations of the Shining Path Maoists among the Indians of the Andes, or he may be referring to the plunging inti, Peru's rubber currency, or the corrupting effect of the cocaine trade.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.10
But he is swiftly drawn into a tangle of memories about a less newsworthy and more exotic part of Peru: its corner of the Amazon jungle.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.11
This narrator is a foil for Mr. Vargas Llosa, a cosmopolitan writer with one well-tailored leg in journalism.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.12
He is in Florence to shake himself free of Peru and get some writing done, just as Mr. Vargas Llosa has gone to Paris and now goes frequently to London for the same purpose.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.13
But this narrator happens upon some photographs in a gallery, pictures taken in Peruvian Amazonia of the untamed and nomadic Machiguenga tribe.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.14
And they remind him of his own experiences with that unhappy scattered culture and of his friend at Lima's University of San Marcos, Saul Zuratas.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.15
Saul was a high-strung student of ethnography, a Jew marked doubly as an outsider because of a huge wine-dark birthmark on his face, for which people called him Mascarita, Mask Face.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.16
Saul knew about the Machiguengas from his studies, and through him the narrator became interested in this most recalcitrant and un-Westernizable of all the indigenous peoples who had come under the Spanish yoke.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.17
Saul, meanwhile, came to believe that anthropology, even at its most benign, was as insidious a form of cultural imperialism as the superficially more blatant activities of Christian missionaries.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.18
Saul mysteriously disappears.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.19
This is what we know at the end of the opening section of "The Storyteller."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.20
The next voice we hear sounds like this: "There was no evil, there was no wind, there was no rain.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.21
The women bore pure children.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.22
If Tasurinchi wanted to eat, he dipped his hand into the river and brought out a shad flicking its tail . . ."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.23
And this: "Moving, walking.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.24
Keeping on, with or without rain, by land or by water, climbing up the mountain slopes or climbing down the ravines."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.25
The speaker is never identified.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.26
He tells his stories in his majestically simple way, in a "language" all his own.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.27
There are creation myths and cosmologies and hunting stories -- a whole culture is contained within these dreamy narratives.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.28
It is as though Mr. Vargas Llosa had recorded a storytelling session at a Machiguenga campfire.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.29
And this is just the effect he hopes to have on the reader, as he alternates chapters in his "own" voice with chapters somehow "borrowed" from the Machiguenga storyteller.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.30
For most of the book, there is no direct connection between its urban and its Amazonian modes.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.31
But the contrast between them becomes a living thing through the brilliant contrast of narrative styles that Mr. Vargas Llosa creates.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.32
He controls this counterpoint like a novelistic Bach, reaching an audacious extreme in a hilarious chapter in which the "Vargas Llosa" voice relates his adventures as an inept television newsman.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.33
But the joke turns serious when a reportage takes him to Amazonia and he encounters the missionaries who know more than anyone else about the Machiguengas.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.34
By this point, the narrator has become obsessed with finding out about the Machiguenga storytellers, who, he had heard years before, functioned like cultural glue for a tribe split into many small bands in constant motion through the jungle.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.35
The storytellers traveled among the bands, reminding them of their identity.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.36
But why would no Machiguenga the narrator meets during his reportage even admit that there were storytellers?
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.37
The narrator eventually deduces the extraordinary answer, which is confirmed in a literally Kafkaesque manner by a storyteller in the next chapter.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.38
I am trying to give away as little as possible, but this is not really a mystery or some kind of jungle thriller.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0174_2006_0331.39
It will be read for the brilliant clash of styles of narration and the even more brilliant way that they have been tied together into a large metaphor for literature and its function in society.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.1
It was a parent's ultimate nightmare.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.2
As the crippled jet prepared for an emergency landing, Sylvia Tsao wrapped her 23-month-old son, Evan, in blankets and, following cabin-crew orders, placed him on the floor.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.3
She held him down tightly, trying to protect him.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.4
"Suddenly, the world seemed to end," she told investigators later.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.5
Crashing into a cornfield, United Airlines' Flight 232 flipped over, and she lost her grip on her son.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.6
"I saw for an instant my son's body floating and flying" toward the back of the plane, Ms. Tsao recalled.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.7
When the plane stopped moving, she frantically tried to find him.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.8
But Evan died of smoke inhalation.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.9
July's Sioux City crash has fueled an emotionally charged debate.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.10
Safety advocates and members of Congress, calling babies "the neglected population," are stepping up a campaign for the mandatory use of infant safety seats on all flights.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.11
But the Federal Aviation Administration is reluctant to require separate seats for babies because of the added cost for traveling parents.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.12
Some FAA officials note that few infants have been killed in plane crashes, raising the question of whether safety seats really are needed.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.13
A 1981 Harvard Medical School study that scrutinized accidents in the late 1970s concluded that perhaps three babies would have been saved in a five-year period if safety-seat use had been required.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.14
The National Transportation Safety Board will take a close look at the issue during four days of hearings that begin today on the broader issue of what caused the crash that killed 112 people.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.15
"Infants', toddlers' and young children's safety should no longer be ignored as if they don't count," Mrs. Tsao wrote to the board in advocating use of the safety seats.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.16
All 50 states require that small children be strapped into safety seats in cars.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.17
On planes, FAA rules dictate that children two years old and over have their own tickets and be strapped into regular seats, just as adults are.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.18
Babies under two may sit on laps and fly for free.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.19
But it is almost impossible to keep hold of a baby during an air crash, or even in severe turbulence.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.20
During the Sioux City crash, Lori Michaelson of Cincinnati lost her grip on her baby as the plane lurched and tipped over.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.21
Another passenger heard one-year-old Sabrina's cry and pulled her from an overhead luggage compartment.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.22
The FAA encourages the use of safety seats, but in the past many parents have run into problems trying to use them, even when the plane was only half-full or they had bought an extra ticket especially for the baby.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.23
When Vanessa Merton, an associate dean at Pace University School of Law, decided to take her young son to Europe last spring, she called four carriers to ask about their policies on car seats.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.24
"The people acted like I was transporting heroin," she says.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.25
One reservation agent told her -- incorrectly -- that the airline barred the use of the seats on flights.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.26
After the Sioux City crash, Lori Michaelson bought a car seat for her daughter for the flight home to Cincinnati.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.27
But on one leg of the trip, she was ordered by a flight attendant to take Sabrina out of the seat and hold her during takeoff and landing -- the most dangerous parts of any flight.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.28
Airlines say that such mistakes are decreasing in the aftermath of Sioux City, but proponents of the safety devices say they still get complaints from parents.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.29
"People are told one thing on the phone, another at check in, another at the gate, and another on the plane," says Stephanie Tombrello, executive director of the Los Angeles Area Child Passenger Safety Association, which petitioned the FAA in June for mandatory use of child-safety seats.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.30
The Association of Flight Attendants, the main flight attendants' union, is strongly backing that request.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.31
The FAA argues that requiring safety seats for all babies might actually diminish, not enhance, safety.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.32
As part of such a rule, officials say, parents would probably be required to buy an extra ticket for the baby.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.33
The increased cost of flying would inevitably encourage some families to drive rather than fly, they say.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.34
Commercial airlines have the lowest accident rate of all transportation modes -- much lower than cars, for example.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.35
Anthony Broderick, the FAA's acting Executive Director for Regulatory Standards and Compliance, contends that the current rule is the best approach because it allows parents to make their own decision on whether to use a safety seat.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.36
But he admits that the agency is in "a very uncomfortable position."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.37
He says the agency soon will propose that airlines be prohibited from denying the use of safety seats.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.38
(Most airlines don't prohibit their use.)
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.39
He says the agency also will seek public comment on whether the seats should be required.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.40
Walter Coleman, Vice President of Operations for the Air Transport Association, the trade group for the major airlines, describes the call for safety seats as "legitimate" and says the group is studying the issue.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.41
But privately some airline officials fear that if parents must buy extra tickets for babies, whole families will stop flying.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.42
Others worry that the FAA might write a rule forcing airlines to pick up part of the tab for increased infant safety.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.43
Generally, airlines say they welcome the use of a government-approved safety seat and will even allow the restraint to take up a regular seat for free if the flight isn't crowded.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.44
(Most car seats made in recent years are certified for use on aircraft and are so marked.)
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.45
But space can only be guaranteed if a ticket is purchased.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.46
What the industry really wants is some kind of device that would protect babies without taking up an extra seat.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.47
But no one has come up with anything that is safer in a crash than the current practice of bundling babies up and trying to pin them to the floor.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.48
Parents are advised against holding the infants, for fear that in an accident the babies could be crushed by the adult's weight.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.49
Proponents of safety seats are turning up the heat on the FAA.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.50
Yesterday, Rep. James Lightfoot, an Iowa Republican, sent FAA Administrator James Busey a letter signed by 56 House members urging the agency to require infant safety seats.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0175_2006_0331.51
If the FAA refuses, Rep. Lightfoot says, he will push legislation to require the change.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.1
It is a peaceful time in this part of western India.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.2
The summer crop is harvested, winter sowing has yet to begin.

Farmers in loose turbans and fancy earrings spend their afternoons laughing and gossiping at the markets.

One could imagine such a lull in the lives of the Arabs before the quadrupling of oil prices.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.5
For just as the Arabs were in the 1960s, the farmers of Sidhpur are on the brink of global power and fame.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.6
The Arabs had merely oil.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.7
These farmers may have a grip on the world's very heart.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.8
Or, at least, its heart disease.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.9
That is because Sidhpur has a near-monopoly on the world's supply of flea seed, also known as flea wort or, in Western parlance, psyllium: a tiny, tasteless, obscure seed that, according to early research, may reduce cholesterol levels in the blood.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.10
Ever since the link to cholesterol was disclosed, Americans have begun scarfing up psyllium in their breakfast cereals.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.11
If further research proves the seed's benefits, this dusty farm district could become the epicenter of a health-food fad to rival all fads since cod-liver oil.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.12
"This seed's not grown anywhere else in India, or anywhere else in the world," says T.V. Krishnamurthy, a vice president of Procter & Gamble India Ltd., a major psyllium buyer and promoter.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.13
"The proper climatic conditions don't exist in many places in the world."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.14
Arvind Patel, a processor and exporter of the seed, raves: "If psyllium takes the place of oat bran, it will be huge."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.15
Whether psyllium makes Sidhpur's fortune depends on cholesterol-fearing Americans, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and, of course, the outcome of further research.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.16
Only one thing is certain here: Pysllium is likely to remain solely an export item from Sidhpur for a long time.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.17
Local farmers say it is as good a cash crop as mustard or fenugreek, a legume.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.18
But they have no desire to eat a bowl of psyllium each morning, and, perhaps, little need: lean, frugal vegetarians, the farmers are innocents in the clogged, treacherous world of cholesterol.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.19
Psyllium is an annual herb, Plantago ovata, that has been used for centuries by folk doctors here, mainly as a laxative and anti-diarrheal.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.20
As such, the soluble fiber has an almost fanatic following in northern India.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.21
"I can assure you," attests a 25-year-old lawyer in New Delhi, with a meaningfully raised eyebrow, "from personal experience, it works."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.22
A prominent businessman in Bombay gives a similar testimonial: "I have been taking it daily since 1961."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.23
Folk doctors also prescribe it for kidney, bladder and urethra problems, duodenal ulcers and hemorrhoids.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.24
Some apply it to gouty joints.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.25
The plant has a hairy stem that produces flowers and diminutive seeds.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.26
It is the seed's colorlessness and size -- 1,000 of them weigh only 1.5 grams, or about as much as two paper clips -- that explain the historical allusions to fleas.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.27
The translucent husk of the seed is removed, sifted and crushed; the seed itself is fed to animals.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.28
Some 90% of the crop, which was worth $26 million last year, is exported.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.29
For decades, psyllium husk has been the main ingredient in such laxatives as Procter & Gamble Co.'s Metamucil, the top-selling brand in the U.S., and Ciba-Geigy Corp.'s Fiberall.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.30
But some time ago, researchers discovered that soluble fibers also lower cholesterol levels in the blood.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.31
Cincinnati-based P&G took an interest; it ordered two studies on psyllium and cholesterol.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.32
One of the studies, done at the University of Minnesota, tested 75 people with raised cholesterol levels.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.33
After 16 weeks, the group that took three daily teaspoons of Metamucil saw a significant dip in their general cholesterol levels, and an even larger reduction in levels of low-density lipoproteins, the so-called bad cholesterol.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.34
In late 1987, P&G asked the FDA for approval to market Metamucil as the first non-prescription, cholesterol-lowering product in the U.S.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.35
In April, the psyllium bandwagon got more crowded.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.36
General Mills Inc., the food giant, launched a breakfast cereal called Benefit, containing psyllium, oat, wheat and beet bran; the words, "reduce cholesterol" were prominently displayed on its package.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.37
In September, Kellogg Co. launched a competing psyllium-fortified cereal called Heartwise.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.38
Suddenly, on television, in advertisements and on their cereal boxes, Americans were inundated with news about the obscure seed.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.39
The flood of claims and counter-claims worried consumers and actually hurt sales of the new cereals.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.40
This month, the Food and Drug Administration expressed concern that Americans might someday, in various forms, ingest too much psyllium.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.41
Currently, there is a lull in the psyllium war.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.42
The FDA has asked Kellogg and General Mills to show research that their cereals are safe.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.43
It also ordered P&G to produce more studies to buttress its claims that Metamucil can lower cholesterol.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.44
But the agency hasn't yanked psyllium off store shelves.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.45
If the FDA approves the new uses of psyllium, other companies are expected to rush to market with psyllium products.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.46
"It's going to be a sensational thing," says Mr. Krishnamurthy of P&G in Bombay.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.47
Says psyllium exporter Mr. Patel: "I just got back yesterday from the U.S.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.48
In the newspapers, on the radio and TV, psyllium is everywhere."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.49
But the news of the boom has yet to trickle down to the farmers.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.50
They only know of one use for the crop, as a laxative, and with psyllium prices currently languishing in the wake of a bumper crop, they think of the seed as a marginal crop, something to grow between summer wheat crops.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.51
"Psyllium's not a good crop," complains Sooraji Jath, a 26-year-old farmer from the village of Lakshmipura.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.52
"You get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.53
Even at the Basic Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics Export Promotion Council, the government agency that promotes the seed, the psyllium boom is distant thunder.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.54
The staff brags about psyllium's hefty contribution to American regularity, without quite grasping the implications of the research on cholesterol.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.55
The council's annual report has psyllium on its last page, lumped with such unglamorous export items as sarsaparilla and "Nux vomica," a plant that induces vomiting.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.56
In one way, the psyllium middlemen -- the buyers and exporters -- are glad to keep news of the boom to themselves.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.57
They want psyllium prices low for their purchases next year.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.58
But there's a catch.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.59
Sidhpur and adjacent districts are the only places in the world where psyllium is grown in large quantities.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.60
This is partly due to the particular demands of the crop.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.61
Psyllium needs sandy soil, dew during the first few weeks, and then total dryness when its seeds are maturing.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.62
Small crops are grown in Pakistan, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Brazil, but their quality can't compare to that of Indian psyllium.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.63
Big buyers like Procter & Gamble say there are other spots on the globe, and in India, where the seed could be grown.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.64
"It's not a crop that can't be doubled or tripled," says Mr. Krishnamurthy.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.65
But no one has made a serious effort to transplant the crop.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.66
In Sidhpur, it is almost time to sow this year's crop.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.67
Many farmers, too removed to glean psyllium's new sparkle in the West, have decided to plant mustard, fennel, cumin, fenugreek or castor-oil seeds.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.68
Mr. Jath is thinking of passing up psyllium altogether this year in favor of a crop with a future such as cumin or fennel.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0176_2006_0331.69
"Maybe I'll plant castor-oil seeds."
