[edit] U.S. lawThe controlling precedent in the United States was set in 1964 by the United States Supreme Court in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.21
It is considered a key decision in supporting the First Amendment and freedom of the press.

A fairly high threshold of public activity is necessary to elevate people to public figure status.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.23
Typically, they must either be:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.24
a public figure, either a public official or any other person pervasively involved in public affairs, or · a limited purpose public figure, meaning those who have "thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.25
A "particularized determination" is required to decide whether a person is a limited purpose public figure, which can be variously interpreted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.26
According to attorney Aaron Larson,[citation needed][2]

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.28
But even if she did become a public figure she did nothing to cast herself into the nomenclature Limbaugh used to lambast her.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.29
He was malicious and his comments harmful.

You have an amazing ability to read words that are not written, it seems to be a gift only brain-addled liberals get.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0156.16
Do you trade your common sense for it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0156.17
If for profit insurance companies thought it would increase their bottom line they'd ALREADY be providing that benefit FOR FREE.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0156.18
The FACT is that if that benefit is provided, SOMEBODY, namely the policyholder, is going to PAY for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0156.19
In the case of religious organizations, that's just not going to work.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0156.20
You get the fucking insurance companies to stand up and SWEAR that this benefit won't cost policyholders ONE THIN DIME and you might be able to sway the majority opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0156.21
Short of that it's all a bunch of bullshit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0156.22

If they don't pay for birth control then they'll pay more for pregnancies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0156.26
Or if you want to say we are paying, then if WE don't pay for birth control it is going to raise premiums because of expensive child births.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0156.27

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0172.14
Fortunately, you do not speak for most women.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0172.15
Between now and next Nov., most women (not you, tho'), will have been filling up their SUV's at the pump to drop off their kids for school, continue to pay for increased food prices, and some aware ones may be even aware of continued runaway debt (hell, some may realize that Greece has begun to get their fiscal house in order, even before us!).

I certainly can't remember it ever happening.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0174.3
I wonder how his dittoheads who defended him are going to take this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0174.4

Worth highlighting what the Carbonite CEO said:

Mr. Limbaugh, with his highly personal attacks on Miss Fluke, overstepped any reasonable bounds of decency.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0183.5
Even though Mr. Limbaugh has now issued an apology, we have nonetheless decided to withdraw our advertising from his show.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0194.7
Leave it to a brain-dead pussy lib to equate an apology with weakness
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0194.8
except of course when the dopey-assed President is the one who is constantly engaged in such behavior.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0195.12
And to think: they'll never know for sure that you are merely a lying piece of shit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0196.5
Sandra Fluke is not the first women to kick the shit out of Rush, Hillary did it first.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0197.6
Neither did.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0198.7
Nice statement by Carbonite.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0199.9
Except of course when a big fat idiot Limbaugh engages in such behavior eh dipshit?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0199.10
Al Franken is right!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0200.11
Wrong, assbreath.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0200.12
An apology can occasionally be a good thing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0200.13
To the extent that Rush was a bit over the line in his attempt to use absurdity to expose absurdity, he is perfectly free to admit his own error of judgement and to apologize to the woman for his intemperate remarks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0200.14
But for the current infestation in the Oval Orifice to apologize so often and so ridiculously is another matter entirely.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0200.15
That dope doesn't apologize for his own flawed actions and decisions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0200.16
No.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0200.17
He apologizes for things on behalf of all of us that do no t even warrant an apology.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0200.18
Al Franken was not right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0200.19
He was just a pontificating gasbag liberal whore.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0200.20
Still is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0201.6
LOL, but people will know for sure that you are a lying DICKHEAD!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0201.7
Kudos for Carbonite!!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0203.6
No.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0203.7
I really am not going to buy Craponite, now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0203.8
The dickhead would be you, if you had a dick.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0203.9
But a rancid pussy like you is more of a twat head.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0204.6
While her husband was getting a blow job in the Oval Office.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0204.7
And she and her daughter were upstairs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0204.8
An intern was on her knees sucking him off.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0204.9
Lets talk truth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0205.15
That's SENATOR Al Franken to you pal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0205.16
Can you say...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0205.17
SENATOR Al Franken?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0205.18
I thought as much!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0206.15
limbaugh is a pontificatin,drug abusing,dominican hooker fuckign fat piece of shit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0206.16
EIB actually stands for the excrement broadcastting network.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0206.17
Franken on the other hand is a well educated united states senator.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0227.17
Apology...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0227.18
what apology?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0228.1
LOL, where in the hell did you come up with that one Tiny?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0228.3
Hey nice to see you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0228.4
When did you join?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0228.5
Hell's bells its a sad day when I have to explain to young ones on the internet that a hoe was originally a garden tool....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0230.1
Are you talking Ed Shultz ?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0230.2
I watch him hoping he has a stroke on the set.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0230.3
He will sound a lot smarter afterwards too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0230.4
Bad form...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0230.5
we are'nt like them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0230.6
I dont wish death on any liberals....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0230.7
just sayin Brah
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0230.8
I don't wish death on him...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0230.9
just a massive stroke.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0230.10
I hope he lives a long time as a veggie before they pull the plug.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0231.22
Did you actually read the "apology" or did you just spew that robotically?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.1
Anybody seen apologies for names given to Governor Palin?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.2
Just curious.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.3
The high and mighty seem to be going overboard on this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.4
How about names given to Governor Palin's children?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.5
Trig rings a bell.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.6
It was Sarah Palin who called Trig retarded, according to Levi Johnston.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.7
Maybe you should talk to Palin.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.8

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.12
Wonkettes and Andrew Sullivan pushed it to the max.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.13
Levi well, what can I say?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.14
I know the drill.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.15
I know what they did.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.16
Nothing short of evil that anyone could be proud of.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.17
Cruel and mean.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.18
And not necessary at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0232.19
Poor baby wasn't running for public office.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0233.10
Who the fuck caress?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0234.20
What did Sullivan do?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0235.11
Ah.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0235.12
You want him to share your fate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0236.8
Truth???
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0236.9
OK....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0236.10
Sandra Fluke needs to keep her damn legs shut, and stop asking me to help pay for her sexual promiscuity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0236.11
Obama needs to tend to presidential shit, and leave Rush alone.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0236.12
The left needs to listen to what is said from their side of the aisle for a 'CHANGE'.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0236.13
Hows that for a start?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0237.7
Yep.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0237.8
I read it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0237.9
Unlike you or Zoom, I also grasped what he was saying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0237.10
Someday, with lots of education, you too might be able to understand what words mean.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0238.6
What they talked about the big waterhead boy?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0239.19
The very last sentence, for starters, might provide you with a clue:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0239.20
Rush said, in that very last sentence, and I quote, "I sincerely apologize to Ms. Fluke for the insulting word choices."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0240.7
Greetings Salt....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0240.8
Come here to lie some more ?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0241.7
Damn your an asshole.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0242.13
Can you link to Fluke talking about needing birth control for her sex life?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0242.14
You didn't watch her testimony and you are making a fool of yourself, but keep going.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0243.10
I am sure it will remind you of a family reunion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0244.8
Yep, me and Richard Pryor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0245.8
He is also a liar and a prick and living off the government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0246.7
Nope.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0246.8
But they'll be sure to bathe you in ranch dressing, future vegetable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0247.4
Nah, I work.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0247.5
My military retirement goes straight to my 401K, so yes I'll be living off the government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0248.5
You are a military contractor....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0248.6
or so you said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0248.7
By definition, you live off the government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0249.11
I dont give a shit....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0249.12
I dont want to pay for it!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0249.13
If she can afford law school, she can afford her 'pills'.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0249.14
I GUARANTEE you she probably enjoys her little cell phone....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0249.15
she can pay for own damn birth control pills.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0250.6
I am sure they don't even know how to spell ranch dressing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0250.7
Present moron.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0251.7
Hahahaha.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0251.8
Yep.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0251.9
War pays well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0252.1
Truth???
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0252.14
You are a fucking idiot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0252.15
She never talked about her sex life.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0252.16
But keep showing how utterly dumb you are.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0253.4
You are correct.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0253.5
She simply said she needed 1000/year for contraception.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0253.6
Her testimony was so poorly worded that people assumed she was banging the entire campus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0253.7
She's not going to make a very good lawyer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0254.11
Last time I checked....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0254.12
you get prego by having sex.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0254.13
contraception keeps that from happening in most cases....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0254.14
then there are those women who use the pill to control hormones...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0254.15
its still birth control, and I dont want to pay for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0255.8
Really?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0255.9
Link?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0256.14
Don't worry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0256.15
You'll be gone soon.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0257.11
As a general rule of thumb, it is not prudent to take anything said by a militant hack like Salt Peter at face value.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0257.12
In his particular instance, however, I have to note that he has a bit of a point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0257.13
There is one line in her testimony which makes it possible to assume that she was talking about women, including herself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0257.14
Without insurance coverage, contraception, as you know, can cost a woman over $3,000 during law school.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0257.15
For a lot of students who, like me, are on public interest scholarships, that?s practically an entire summer?s salary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0257.16
40% of the female students at Georgetown Law reported to us that they struggle financially as a result of this policy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0257.17
But, read in it's entirety (I prefer the written format over the video), it does appear that she spoke almost entirely of OTHER women.

Really?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0258.12
Where am I going?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0258.13
I dont have a heart condition....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0258.14
so WTF?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0259.18
Damn....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0259.19
thats a stretch, but OK.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0260.15
No.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0260.16
I don't think it's a stretch at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0260.17
She left herself open to some misinterpretation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0260.18
But since she was pontificating as a representative of an advocacy group, I think it's fair to read her a bit more literally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0260.19
And in that vein, with the exception of the portion I highlighted, she was clearly talking about other women.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0260.20
The import of what she was advocating (whether she is sexually hyper active or totally celibate) is still facially absurd.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0260.21
But that's a different kettle of fish.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.1
The very fact that he apologized is disappointing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.2
We have gotten so degenerate as a culture that we have to be sorry for telling the truth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.3
There's no TRUTH is this pile of shit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.4
She never did.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.5
Not once.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.6
That did not stop Rush from saying things like this: Rush said she has boyfriends " Lined up around the block."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.7
He said she said " she was having so much sex she can't afford it."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.8
He asked: "...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.9
what does that make her?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.12
She wants to be paid to have sex.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.13
She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.14
And: "Ms. Fluke, have you ever heard of not having sex?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.15
Have you ever heard of not having sex so often?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.17
After saying that the Washington, D.C., Department of Health "will send you free condoms and lube," Limbaugh said: "So, Ms. Fluke and the rest of you feminazis, here's the deal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.18
If we are going to pay for your contraceptives, and thus pay for you to have sex, we want something for it, and I'll tell you what it is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.19
We want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.21
Rush asked of Ms. Fluke: "Who bought your condoms in junior high?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.22
Who bought your condoms in the sixth grade?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.23
Or your contraception.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.24
Who bought your contraceptive pills in high school?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.26
Then: Fluke is "having so much sex, it's amazing she can still walk.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.27
" He also said Georgetown should establish a "Wilt Chamberlin scholarship...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.28
exclusively for women.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.30
Then, again, Limbaugh defended his previous comments and complained "not one person says that, ' Well, did you ever think about maybe backing off the amount of sex that you have?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.32
Later, Limbaugh said that requiring insurance companies to cover contraception is "no different than if somebody knocked on my door that I don't know and said, 'You know what?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.33
I'm out of money.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.34
I can't afford birth-control pills, and I'm supposed to have sex with three guys tonight.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.35
' " · Fluke never even once talked about her own sexual activity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.36
In, no way, shape or form.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.37
In fact, in her testimony, she even said:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.38
?And so, I?m here today to share their voices, and I want to thank you for allowing them ? not me ? to be heard.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.41
All that came from his mouth was a 3 day long tirade of misogynistic putrid slurs and below-the-belt slander aimed at a woman who testified about a public policy matter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.42
There wasn't an ounce of truth in his words.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.43
By her behavior Fluke proved the absolute truth of what he said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.44
She wants birth control coverage to the tune of $1,000 a year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.45
As has been ABUNDANTLY made clear, to use that much BC, she has to be having sex so often that it's a wonder how she is getting through school.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0295.46
But that's a matter between the school and the professors.

"I did not mean a personal attack on Ms. Fluke."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0296.2
Seriously?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0296.3
How is that possible?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0296.4
How do you attack a person, personally, repeatedly, over several days, with a barrage of personal insults,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0296.5
and not mean it to be personal?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0296.6
Bullshit is my profession - Limbaugh
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0297.43
So, your point is that, rather than presenting herself as a slut, she is presenting herself as the 'Voice of the Sluts"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0297.44
Is that the correction you would like?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0298.1
Ironically, in the 90's, "Character Matters" became a well worn slogan on the Right,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0298.2
and the man primarily responsible for that was none other than Rush Limbaugh.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0298.3
I would like to be able to ask him when, for him personally, did that slogan expire?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0305.45
There's no behavior she engaged in, other than testifying in Washington.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0305.46
And you have got to be as rock solid stupid as Rush and his dittohead idiots to make a statement like "to use that much birth control."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0305.47
You fucking dolts don't even understand how the pill works.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0305.48
You take ONE pill a day - if you have no sex, or if you have sex 10 times a week.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0305.49
The cost of the pill has nothing to do with the amount of sex one has.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0305.50
Christ, some of you have the IQ of lint.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0305.51
If you are not having sex, but choose to instead DEDICATE your time instead towards maintaining a 4.0 GPA average, you don't need contraception do you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0305.52
Doesn't take much intelligence to figure that out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0305.53
Get off the free lazy entitlement train, and live up to paying for your own choices in responsibility.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0306.3
Only if you consider women who have healthy sexual relationships to be "sluts".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0306.4
What I find amusing is that the economic system that Republicans support (which is most of us slaving away at thankless jobs so a few rich douchebags like Romney and Limbaugh can have polo ponies and mansions) actually requires contraception.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0306.5
Women are expected to use contraception in college, so they can get their degrees, and they are expected to use contraception while working their way up through Cubicle Hell.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0306.6
And maybe, if they are really lucky, they might be just secure enough in their jobs to take some time off to have a baby.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0306.7
Maybe.

They often wait until the biological clock is about to run out.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0309.45
Are you honestly too stupid to understand that the amount of birth control pills a woman uses has no relationship whatsoever to the frequency of intercourse she has.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0309.46
ARE YOU HONESTLY THAT STUPID, or are you simply padding your reputation as a USMB troll?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0309.47
Some people never need birth control.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0309.48
They'd like to need it, but they don't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0310.1

Excellence demands abstinence?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0312.13
Do you apply that to your own life?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0312.14
Your job, for example?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0312.15
Are you abstinent because you want to be more productive at work?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0312.16
Or are you just a mental retard?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0318.47
Can't you just admit that the cost of birth control pills doesn't come close to the money she claims she requires to support her sex addiction?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0318.48
Are you deliberately stupid, or just trying to obfuscate just this one time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0318.49
If all she needs are birth control pills, that doesn't come CLOSE to the $1,000 she claims she needs?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0318.50
No one wants to deny her birth control and disease control for this woman is a public health matter (which is why so many clinics give out free condoms) she just has to either pay for it, or extend herself far enough to get it free like the street whores do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0319.3
No, she's documenting the long list of lies that Limbaugh manufactured for the purpose of defaming the character of this woman.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0319.4

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0319.7
If I did that would not be an apt analogy because Michelle Malkin chose to make a lucrative career out of fitting that description.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0320.10
You didn't answer my question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0320.11
I'll repeat it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0320.12
Are you honestly too stupid to understand that the amount of birth control pills a woman uses has no relationship whatsoever to the frequency of intercourse she has?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0321.1
The key to Rush's apology is do we look at him as saying "it was the wrong thing to say and I won't do it again" or " I am sorry the reaction was so hard against me"????
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0322.11
I don't know how much they cost.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0322.12
I don't take them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0322.13
She may have been on the high end, but then I read this:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0322.14
In reality, oral contraceptives or “The Pill” range between $35 and $250 for the initial provider visit and the cost of a monthly supply of pills ranges between $15 and $50 a month, which amounts to between $180 and $600 a year depending on woman’s medical coverage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0322.15
This means some women without insurance coverage for contraception may pay over $850 the first year of their prescription.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0322.16
Other forms of birth control are far more expensive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0322.17
For instance, the cost for a monthly supply of birth control patches ranges from $15 to $80 dollars, or between $180 and $960 a year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0322.18
Combined with the doctors visit, uninsured women could spend over $1,200 dollars in the first year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0322.19
<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/02/10/423018/santorum-birth-control-is-not-something-you-need-insurance-for-because-it-costs-just-a-few-dollars/">LINK</a>
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0322.20
I do think she said up to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0322.21
For some, I've no doubt it cost that much.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0322.22
For others, less.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0322.23
Nonetheless, a prescription should be something that should be covered in the policy for which she contributes premiums.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0323.2
He's not sorry for what he did, he's sorry he got caught.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0324.1
That still doesn't paper over the fact, katzdoggie - you think birth control pills are like rubbers, apparently - I guess in your mind, you take one every time you have sex.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0324.2
Which is freakin hilarious.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0325.6
According to her, she's a slut.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0325.7
He just put the right term to it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0325.8
Are you saying she's not a slut, she's a liar?

Here�s that section of <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entries/rush-limbaugh-apologizes-to-sandra-fluke">Limbaugh�s statement</a> : I think it is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times, we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of Congress.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0326.8

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0328.20
She did say 'up to', and she also made no specific reference to either here own sex life or her own use of contraception,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0328.21
so all the slurs were manufactured out of thin air.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0329.20
You can just tell those who didn't listen to her testimony for themselves.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0329.21
It's pretty revealing how many only go by what their right wing pundits tell them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0330.9
She never references her personal sex life.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0331.13
Years ago, Rush Limbaugh used to end his Friday show by saying to his dittoheads,

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0354.1
There's no way she could have and still say that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0354.2
The only way to save face is to not read it but pretend she did.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0354.3
Which makes her just an uninformed idiot, not really a full-boar liar.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0354.4
I do recall she accepted a phone call from President Obama before she came forward with her statement regarding contraception.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0354.5
Whether he was providing her with "coaching" tips on how she is to present her statement regarding contraceptives, we will never know.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0354.6
Yet it's interesting how Obama chose to have a discussion with her BEFORE she came forward, instead of waiting for an opportunity to make himself available afterwards.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0354.7
You recall wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0354.8
Obama called her out AFTER Rush called her a SLUT, after the media shitstorm - and to tell her her parents *should* be proud of her - not ashamed, as that dirtbag Limbaugh suggested.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0354.9

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0360.1
So, the drug addled gasbag apologized for calling her a slut, but not for lying about her testimony in the first place.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0360.2
Not much of an apology.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0360.3
Where does Rushbo's apology leave O'Reilly?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0360.4
O'Reilly defended the tub of goo and even went so far as to say Rush's 2nd favorite drug, Viagra, should be carried on insurance plans, but contraception should not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0361.22
I don't see it so much of a defense of Rush but a comment on the absurdity of the Democrat's arguments.

This just shows that even when he apologizes it's never enough.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0371.2
Rush didn't give them the exact words they wanted in his apology.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0371.3
He had to say they were right to claim that we're trying to prevent this woman from getting BC.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0371.4
He had to say that he was a filthy pig and that he was quitting.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0371.5
They don't want him on the air.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0371.6
That is the purpose of their self-righteous indignation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0371.7
Not me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0371.8
I want him on the air as much as possible.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0371.9
I want him to be free to say as much, as foul, as nasty as he wants it to be.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0371.10
I wish he had a bigger blowhorn so that even more Americans could hear him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0371.11
Nothing would be better.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0371.12
Unfortunately the left won't allow that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0371.13
They know that if he is then more people will start thinking like he does.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0371.14
They can't have that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0372.5

Rush Limbaugh has the freedom and absolute right to present his commentary point of view, as polarizing and confronting as some of his statements may be.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0373.8
That's part of the First Ammendment right we have, no one has the right to silence him, especially when we have the likes of Howard Stern and Jeneane Garofalo to contend with.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0374.12

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0375.15
I don't think so.

I'm firmly in the "give 'em enough rope" camp.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0375.17

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868652_0025.3
I'm glad he's dead.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868652_0025.4
Of course you are.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868652_0025.5
You're a prick.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868652_0025.6

Hahahaha.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868652_0025.8
I wonder if the gravedigger tossed a copy of the Sherrod video in the grave with breitbart?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868652_0025.9
Show respect for the deceased.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868652_0025.10

Ahhh, yes, a paranoid racist moron.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868652_0026.5

I just pointed out how tolerance gets you killed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868652_0026.9
tolerance didn't get them killed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868652_0026.10
intolerance did.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868652_0027.1

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0007.10
so he's not a career politician anymore.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0007.11
However, when he was he's the only one I can remember that actually got things done.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0007.12
After all, he is responsible for balancing the budget and actually giving us a surplus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0007.13
When it comes to Romney, he's a businessman but he would have been a Senator if he could have beat Kennedy.

Yesterday Glenn Beck spent the entire program talking about how progressive Newt Gingrich was.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.3
The way he was talking about him it was like he was actually Barrack Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.4
Beck almost sounded like he has lost his mind.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.5
Glenn Beck supports Christian fundamentalists like Michelle Bachmann and Rick Santorum.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.6
He feels that Bachmann is his choice for President.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.7
Beck doesn't think that now is the time to compromise on our principles.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.8
Well, from what I can see, religion is the number one principle that Glenn Beck needs from his candidate.

If any of you don't know, Glenn Beck is a Mormon, or more accurately a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or LDS. I am currently an inactive member of this same church.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.10
I have some disagreements with the church.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.11
Some would say it is a cult.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.12
Harry Reid and Mitt Romney are two prominent members btw. From what I've seen it is a cult, a cult that Beck is a member of.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.13
He is a prime example of why Barrack Obama is currently our President.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.14
Folks that refused to accept anything other than their idea of a perfect candidate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.15
Someone who has all of the right beliefs and says all of the right things.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.16
I've talked to these types.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.17
The type of Christian that doesn't like anyone of other faiths.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.18
Christians that have forgotten the teachings of Christ or never learned them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.19
Love thy brother as you would love yourself...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.20
regardless of his beliefs or his race.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.21
Glenn Beck doesn't support Newt because he thinks his immigration policies are too progressive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.22
He accuses Newt of being too progressive when it comes to health care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.23
He's also another one of these nut cases that mistook what Newt said about Paul Ryan's plan claiming he actually wants GOP social-engineering, which is far from the truth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.24
Newt merely said he would not exchange Democrat social-engineering for Republican social-engineering.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.25
Glenn Beck has already made up his mind.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.26
He supports Bachmann, and he supports Santorum, but now he even says he'd rather vote for Ron Paul over Newt Gingrich.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.27
This is insane.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.28
Glenn Beck would rather lose another Presidential election then compromise on his crazy principles.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.29
After listening to him yesterday I got the impression that Beck is slowly losing his fricken mind.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.30
The way he was talking about Gingrich it sounded like he was describing one of the most evil politicians ever to walk the face of the Earth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.31
I believe Beck doesn't understand the way Newt thinks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.32
He's totally misinterpreting his beliefs and thus doing a disservice to his candidacy and doing his best to usher in another 4 years of Barrack Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.33
I don't think Beck really cares right now if this happens and that he may be one of the primary reasons it does.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.34
I'm not gonna voice my thoughts on what exactly is causing Glenn Beck to be so vocal about Newt or George W. Bush in the past.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.35
However I can say that it seems like he's doing more damage to his own professed cause than good.

We should care what Glenn Beck and Dick Cheney think at this point?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0009.39
The GOP seems to be grasping at straws these days not to mention the value they place on irrelevant commentary from both of them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0010.1
the country is getting tired of you manufactured war between the American people
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0011.1
OMGorsh
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0012.2
Coming from an Obama supporter I find that extremely hilarious.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0013.2
Yet whenever a thread about glennbeck pops up you're all over it like a hobo on a ham sandwich.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0014.1
Your party has been found out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0014.2
Your bullshit of hating on half of the American people is getting your failed party no where.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0014.3
That is why no decent republican candidate ( the very few there are) would run this go arround.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0015.40
The GOP can suck my sack.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0015.41
I don't care what they want.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0015.42
They sold us down the river when they pitched in with the Dems and took our Social Security and used it to run up the debt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0015.43
I support workable solutions rather than ideologies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0015.44
I'm willing to overlook a lot just to get Obama out of there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0015.45
Anybody would give this government legitimacy again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0015.46
Right now we're a world-wide laughing-stock.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0016.4
Course no decent candidate ever runs as a Democrat these days as well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0018.38
Hmmmm...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0018.39
I LIKE Glenn Beck.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0018.40
I had always thought he was one of the better looking men in broadcasting...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0018.42
I do NOT always agree with what he says or his angles, but he seems to break things down on his show in such a way that the least informed can potentially better understand...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0018.44
There are times he's been laughable...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0018.45
but it is so with most any politically based show, I suppose.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0018.46
Even the Washington Journal has some callers....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0019.6
So that wasn't you posting in the other Beck thread yesterday?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0020.1
Every time the GOP has to pick a candidate to run for POTUS we see the same thing happening.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0020.2
They use the same sleazy character assassinating techniqes on their fellow Republicans that they use against the Dems.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0020.3
Really, folks, the GOP is a party with a servere character disordered problem in that respect.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0020.4
Remember when the big lies propagandists turned on one of their own who also happened to be a US Military triple amputee to accuse HIM of being a terrorist sympathizer?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0020.5
I mean seriously...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0020.6
how vile is THAT?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0020.7
The GOP is the party of character asssassination, big lies and big propaganda.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0020.8
The Dems have their own underhanded techiques for internacine wars, of course, but the GOP really has the emotional and ethical IQs of a school yeard filled with 8 year bullies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0021.7
Ravi, honey, I criticized the media spin on his words.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0021.8
That doesn't mean I agree with him, or know who he does or does not support.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0022.9
Really?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0022.10
So you didn't even comprehend that he was against Newt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0022.11
That's pretty amazing for someone that prances around and calls other people stupid, ignorant, and unable to comprehend the written word.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0023.8
I was not overly interested in who he was criticizing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0023.9
That's of no interest to me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0023.10
What fascinates me is the ability of seemingly logical people to fall for any old bullshit that the media put out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0023.11
Truth comes second to point scoring with some people....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0023.12
not with me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0024.1
The right will defend anything to cling to their historically failed ideas.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.38
Newt is a progressive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.39
He has said as much himself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.40
You also left out Rush, Hannity and Lavin.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.41
This is also a primary not a general election.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.42
This is the part where all the candidates get trashed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.43
Are all the talkers supposed to love thees guys up or air out there dirty laundry ?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.44
As for the Mormon crap, Beck and the others are not thrilled about Romney.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.45
I fail to see the conspiracy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.46
I didn't imply any kind of conspiracy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.47
I simply said Beck is one of those unbending Christians that will be the Bain of the GOP.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.48
As far as Newt is concerned, I don't believe he's a Progressive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.49
That's just another attempt to trash his ideas.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.50
He's as much a Progressive as Mitt Romney or Jesus Christ.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.51
Let's just say he's more open-minded than your average Republican.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.52
He's also not for bigger government, but more effective government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0025.53
This is just an attempt by the fringe elements on both sides to knock off another Republican front-runner.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.1
Why on earth would Glenn shut up?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.2
He doesn't want us to come to a choose between Newt and Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.3
Two big government progressives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.4
And we have plenty of time to avoid that "choice" so he is reminding everyone who Newt is and what the Tea Party stands for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.5
We want to change Washingon, so we are going to send in the biggest Washington insider campaigning?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.6
We want to close the border by supportng someone who doesn't?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.7
We want to get government out of our lives by supporting someone who has supported the expansion of this government?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.8
We want to restore the Constitution by supportng someone who has voted contrary to it when convenient?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.9
The only thing going for Newt is that balanced budget during the Clinton administration.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.10
He's smart and he's a good talker.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.11
But you know what, there is something more important than talking big.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.12
What's the point of being smart if your working for things that aren't good?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.13
I want to see this nation change for the better.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.14
I want to see this government shrink.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.15
Honestly, I don't know if any of the candidates will actually do that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0036.16
But of all of them, Newt is the one that has grown it the most.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0037.54
He go's after Romney as much as Newt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0037.55
And Newt has called himself a progressive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0037.56
I agree that Beck puts to much religion into his politics, but as far as bashing the GOP candidates he is no worse then the other GOP water boys on the radio.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869043_0037.57
After the primary they will all rally around the one who wins.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.1
This morning I was watching "Good Day New York" on Channel 5, which is part of the FOX network.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.2
The co-host were interviewing a guy who is part of the on-going occupation of Wall St., and were (of course) repeating the media standard line by questioning the man as to why there is no set goals or leadership to advocate such goals.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.3
During his response, the man pointed out that it's about all types of people pointing out that nothing is being done about the economic inequality and subsequent crimes perpetrated by Wall St./banking giants (individuals and corporations)....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.4
and that you had leaders from various backgrounds join in. He stated that Al Sharpton "a self made man from the streets like me" was joining.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.5
at which time co-host Greg Kelly interjected (twice) that like Al Sharpton, Rupert Murdoch is a self made man.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.7
Come again?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.8
Rupert Murdoch INHERITED HIS FATHER'S OWNERSHIP OF TWO NEWSPAPERS IN THE U.K. (Australia).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.9
He did NOT start out in the copy room of some local city paper and work his way up to mogul.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.10
Al Sharpton grew up doing the preacher circuit for his particular brand of religion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.11
Big difference.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.12
I saw this as just another Fox flunkie pushing the "class warfare" line that's heard from the neocon/teabagger pundits in the media.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.13
By trying to equate Murdoch as a successful "every man", co-host Greg Kelly pushes the subliminal context that the Wall St. protesters are just "jealous" of "successful people".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.14
Typical Fox BS....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.15
but not unexpected.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.16

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.18
should have their head examined, so yea, Fox blew it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0024.19
great catch
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0025.1
Unfortunately Class Envy/Class Warfare works.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0025.2

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0025.3

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0025.5

Then..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0025.11
when anything is mentioned about the outrageous behavior of the the top tier in this country..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0025.12
it's class warfare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0025.13
Amazing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0025.14
no not really, whats laughable is the overabundance of shallowness you possess as opposed to any scintilla of critical thinking....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0026.21
Anyone who would compare Sharpton to Hitler is just well a moron and a major pile of shit.

Don't hate your fellow Americans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.2

Don't be jealous and bitter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.4
That only leads to hate and violence.

Some Politicians are now just preying on human weakness.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.8
They are promoting this Class Envy/Class Warfare stuff to get and hang onto power.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.9
It's not healthy for our nation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.10
Turning American against American is just wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.11
A house divided will surely fall.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.12
You say don't hate your fellow Americans but have no problem supporting people who go after union workers, and the so called "moochers".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.13
And Fox is right up there promoting class warfare, running a story on makers and moochers is a prime example of that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.14
So please take your hypocritical bullshit somewhere else.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.15
Fox News covers various angles of all issues.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.16
You chose only that one angle to focus on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.17
But that's ok with me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.18
That's how you feel.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.19
I was just saying how wrong it is for Politicians to promote such jealousy & bitterness towards fellow Americans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.20
It is a deliberate 'Divide & Conquer' agenda.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.21
We don't need to turn on each other.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.22
That's not the right way to go.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.23
Hating a fellow American because he or she is more successful than you will only lead to more hate & violence in this country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.24
I really do hope more Americans turn to God in the future.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0027.25
God Bless and have a good day.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0028.22
you are incapable of comprehension it appears, its not hard, try reading what I said slowly, maybe 3 times, you'll get it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0029.26
Hating Americans because they are not as successful as you also leads to more hate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0029.28
Telling them it is their own fault they are not rich(you buddy Cain) is just as much class warfare as anything that has been said by the OWS.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0029.29
Comparing people who make more, and pay more taxes to the middle class and lower middle class, and calling them makers and takers is class warfare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0030.8
Yeah, I got what you are saying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0030.9
You are still a pile.

Hate to point out the obvious (I lie) but when Murdoch inherited those tow papers in Australia he had been working as an editor for a different paper in another country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0052.17
He then built those tow papers into a media empire that makes idiots like you froth at the mouth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0052.18
If that is not a self made man I have never heard of one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0053.19
Well them you, squire, have never heard of one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0053.20
SLAP OUT OF IT!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0054.22
He took two small papers with declining circulation in a small city in South Australia and built a media empire and made himself on of the wealthiest men in the world.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0054.23
Explain to me, in detail, and using the small words you can understand, how that is not an example of a self made man.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0055.1
The ows are just a bunch of spoiled kids that want great pay w/o the education or effort it takes to get it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0055.2
None of them are taking personal responsibility, just blaming Wall St.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0055.3
I'd be embarrassed to have anyone in my family involved in this non-sense.

they are parents, spouses, long time employees who saw their jobs outsourced overseas....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0055.8
and ALL of them have watched Wall St. and it's banking buddies in management making out like bandits, and then bitch that they may have to give up some tax breaks and loopholes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0055.9
If I were YOU, I'd be embarassed to voice your ignorance in public.

Utter fucking nonsense.

Your lack of information and vast wealth of propaganda, must make it hard to carry on an honest conversation.

Stop getting your info from Fox.

You guys talk about class warfare, I think the right is more involved in class warfare than anyone else.

The problem is, you are going after people just like you.

I listen to what they say on camera, on msnbc, abc and fox.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0056.11
They are all a bunch of spoiled kids, or whiny adults that want other people to take care of them.

I forgot how willfully ignorant and purposely obtuse you can be, Cali-Girl.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0057.19
Let me dumb it down for you: Murdoch was born into the American equivalent of upper middle-class....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0057.20
the next best thing to being "old money".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0057.21
So he had ADVANTAGES from birth...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0057.22
he did NOT have to work his way up the ladder or beat his brains to get a scholarship.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0057.23
So the comparison to Sharpton as a "self made man" is a crock.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0057.24
Got that, bunky?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0057.25
Actually, LackyTiberal, I was wonder when Australia became part of the UK.

Still waiting for TackyLiberal to explain what 'in the UK (Australia)' means.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0058.2
Australia is not in the UK.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0058.3
I stand corrected.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0058.4
Now, do YOU have the cojones to deal with the FACTS that back up my opening posts point regarding the idiotic comparison of Murdoch to Sharpton as "self made men"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0058.5
I'm a details person....

Not rocket science.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0058.10
or maybe it is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0058.11
It seems many Americans are incapable of grasping that fairly straightforward fact.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0058.12
Now, to address your "point".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0058.13
Murdoch inherited two fairly successful newspapers and turned them into a global media empire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0058.14
So, he is a 'self made man', if you want to quibble over that, fine.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0058.15
Personally, I don't give a shit about Murdoch or Sharpton's 'success'....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0058.16
I have zero respect for either.

How's that obsession working for ya champ?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0059.2
If you are addressing me, please explain how telling the truth and pointing out lies RE: Fox News and the Wall St. occupation an "obsession"?

Unless you can prove me wrong, it would seem that YOU are obsessed with just being contrary to anything I post.

Obviously, the reports of major downsizings by various corporations and industries, the official reports spotlighted by Congress and the Senate showing how companies are NOT opening their doors to higher people, and the 9% unemployment rate verified by the unemployment insurance rates reported by ALL press regardless of political affiliation is lost on your closed mind.

Hate to point out your painfully obvious regurgitation of a false premise (I lie), but his editorial work for a London tabloid DID NOT lead up the ladder of hard work to being head of one of Australia's leading news paper The Sunday Mail.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0069.20
he INHERITED that when his father died.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0069.21
Murdoch, the son of Sir Keith Murdoch (18861952), a famous Australian war correspondent and publisher, studied at Worcester College, Oxford (M.A., 1953), and briefly worked as an editor on Lord Beaverbrook's London Daily Express, where he first gained practical experience in the sensationalist journalism that would be a major influence early in his career as a publisher.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0069.22
His father having died, he returned to Australia in 1954 to take over his inheritance, the Sunday Mail and The News, both of Adelaide
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0069.23
No one is denying Murdoch's personal success....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0069.24
but to keep trying to push this BS that he's a "self made man" is just that...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0069.25
BS. Only a complete idiot would believe that an editor of a tabloid becomes the overnight owner of TWO major newspapers based solely on his merit and salary.

Where did I say it did?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0069.29
What I said was that he was working for someone else when his father died.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0069.30
He inherited two papers in Adelaide, the capital of South Australia (which is a state).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0069.31
He then built those two papers into a major media empire by making them profitable and expanding his holdings to other papers in Australia, and then the UK.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0069.32
It was what he did after he inherited them that make him a self made man, not the fact that he inherited them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0069.33
If he had been like you those papers would have been dead by now and no one would have heard of Murdoch.

No one is denying Murdoch's successes, but a "self made man" isn't handed TWO successful newspapers to start building his empire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0073.22
Like all ignorant neocon/teabagger blowhards, once Cali-Girl is proven wrong, she suddenly states that she doesn't care about the very subject she so ardently sounds off about.

Truthfully, I don't give a rat's ass what Murdoch inherited - it's not my business.

Riddle me this, Cali-Girl...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8869384_0073.34
if you don't give a rat's ass about the subject at hand, then why devote so much time and effort in trying to disprove what I wrote?

As I told you elsewhere, if I were a racist I would not have voted for Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8871979_0032.4
But the word racist is so over-used and so frequently misused that it's come to mean whatever the respective user wants it to mean.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8871979_0032.5
So, once again, my understanding of the word racist is it refers to one who dislikes all members of a specific race because they belong to that race -- which excludes me from the category.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8871979_0032.6
By the way, I hasten to add that if I were a racist I would not hesitate to admit it because I'd have no reason not to.

Obama and The Democrats: Are You Listening?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0090.4
If President Obama does not alter course swiftly, if the Democrat Congress does not fully understand the encompassing mistrust against their socialist direction now permeating the American subconscious, the Democrat Party may very well be relegated to the scrap heap of history.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0090.5
The Democrats, under the overtly misguided, impractical, and contradictory leadership of President Obama, have openly turned against those Americans who have the clarity of courage to question the necessity and soundness of their intended policies, equating these outspoken citizens to Nazis, thugs, and all things un-American.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0111.19
so, carry on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0112.1
I asked three times in a thread last week and never got a response......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0112.2
what honor is Glenn restoring?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0112.3
Since no one seems to know, I went and looked it up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0112.7
Join the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin and many more for this non-political event that pays tribute to America’s service personnel and other upstanding citizens who embody our nation’s founding principles of integrity, truth and honor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0112.11
I was unaware that the values that founded this great nation were lost.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0112.12
Perhaps it is a matter of perspective.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0112.13
You actually see the principles of 'integrity, truth and honor' as high on the priority list of any of our politicians?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0112.14
I sure as hell don't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0112.15
I see very little of these three qualities generally in the US....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0112.16
in fact, my impression is that, to many on the left, they're a joke.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0112.17
Yea, the Beckster just exudes the principles of 'integrity, truth and honor' every time he shills for Goldline, a company he's a paid spokesman for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0112.18
They rip off HIS viewers selling them 'fools gold'; gold coins they sell at 200 times their melt value.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0112.19
The Beckster; right wing scum...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0112.20
Among a people generally corrupt liberty cannot long exist.

Is anyone planning to go to the Restoring Honor Rally Glenn is holding in DC next week?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0140.2
Still haven't made up my mind.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0140.3
I'd like to but money's tight.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0140.4
too bad, according to beck, its going to be biblical...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0140.5
I wonder if Muslims are allowed?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0141.1
I can't but I know some people who are.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0141.2
I think it should be a kinda cool day....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0141.3
but not as cool as the 'I have a dream' thing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0141.4
"I have a dream THING".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0141.5
Are you being condescending or sincere?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0141.6
It reads as if you are being condenscending.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0141.7
Please excuse me if I have read it incorrectly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0141.8
Since MLK ranks as one of my "All Time Top 5 Americans", figure it out for yourself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0142.6
It's public property.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0142.7
You figure it out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0142.8
I'm sure you're smart enough.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0143.1
THE Arthur Brooks study
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0143.2
Arthur Brooks writes: "When it comes to giving or not giving, conservatives and liberals look a lot alike.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0143.3
Conservative people are a percentage point or two more likely to give money each year than liberal people, but a percentage point or so less likely to volunteer [citing the 2002 General Social Survey (GSS) and the 2000 Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (SCCBS)]".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0143.4
(pp. 21-22)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0143.5
So, according to THE Arthur Brooks study: conservatives believe in the giving of mammon (money) and liberals believe in the giving of themselves.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0143.6
So you can't win on one argument, you choose another.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0143.7
So what?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0143.8
Liberals volunteer more, I don't buy it, but ok.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0143.9
Hey pea brain...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0143.10
if you don't 'buy' it, then YOUR assertion is invalid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0143.11
Why?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0143.12
IT IS THE SAME STUDY...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0143.16
I should have made myself clearer, my bad.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0143.17
What I'm not buying is the attempt at your · deflection from a discussion centered around donations by monetary means, to volunteering to pick up trash or ladle soup in a soup kitchen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0144.1
Well...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0144.2
no one seems to know what honor is being restored.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0144.3
Just another empty catch phrase from the GOP.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0144.5
Is that really the card you want to play after 'hope' and 'change'?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0145.1
Oh, and Glenn Beck is probably the biggest asshole I have ever seen on TV, although Sean Hannity is a pretty large one too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0145.2
Bill-O isn't far behind.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0145.3
Well, I guess we all know what network YOU watch....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0145.4
cuz if you spent ANY time on MSNBC, you'd realize that Ed Schultz isn't only and asshole, he's a STUPID asshole...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0145.5
along with Keith and that other guy...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0145.6
what's his name...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0145.7
something Maddow.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0145.8
well, i guess we all know what network YOU watch..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0145.9
cuz if you spent ANY time on fox, you'd realize that Glen Beck isn't only and [sic] asshole, he's a STUPID asshole, along with Hannity and that other guy...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0145.11
something Coulter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0145.12
Now go away or I shall mock you for a second time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0145.14
That was just mean...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0146.1
In other words, you can't deal with what he actually says so you resort to namecalling.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0146.2
So Obama actually does have a deep seated hatred for white people?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0146.3
There is proof of this then...?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0146.4
There you go again with the race thing.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0146.5
Gawd get over it!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0146.6
Why wont you answer the question..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0146.7
was beck "factual" when he said the president had a deep seated hatred for white people..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0146.8
I know you hate this, but please stay on point and answer the question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0146.9
Dont come back with I am trying to race bait.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0146.10
Beck said it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0146.11
BECK SAID IT..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0146.12
back him up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0146.13
IS THIS FACTUAL?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0147.13
That was his opinion, it's as factual as any opinion you harbor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.1
You guys really think we are an honorable nation anymore?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.2
Take a look at any headline.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.3
Corruption, crime is rampant.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.4
Our economy is in the middle of a depression because people had no honor or integrity in their business dealings.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.5
Look at the past 4 administrations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.6
You honestly think we've had honorable people in power most of those times?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.7
We get corrupt politicians because the people are themselves corrupt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.8
We need to begin empowering people with integrity and truth again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.9
Because we are going to be going through some pain soon.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.10
It's inevitable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.11
The only question is whether we are prepared for it or not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.12
Does anyone honestly think we can continue spending carelessly with no consequences?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.13
Doesn't matter whether it's personal or public spending, eventually the bill comes in and if we aren't ready, we are screwed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.14
Does anyone honestly think we can tolerate corruption in our politicians and bueaucracies and there are no consequences?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.15
You think we can have a strong economy when we can't trust one another?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.16
Do you think we can be world leaders when others can't trust us?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.17
You think our children will grow to be honorable people if they see us being dishonest and easily corrupted?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.18
Every single individual needs to look at their lives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.19
They need to root out all corruption.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.20
They need to be honest in word and deed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.21
They need to do what they say they will do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.22
They need to do what it takes to meet their responsibilities to take care of themselves, their families, and then do what they can for the community at large.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.23
I am the first one to acknowledge that I need work.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.24
Can you honestly say you don't?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.25
And don't confuse honor with pride.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.26
And Glenn Beck has the way to improve upon all those evils?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.27
Uh huh...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.28
He perpetuates hatred, period.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.29
If it were all about losing our "honor" over the past several years, why wasn't someone who exemplifies that "honor" asked to speak?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.30
Why not someone like General Patreaus or Rick Warren?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.31
Or both?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.32
I know I would love to hear speeches from them about restoring honor and dignity, and September 12th would have been the perfect day.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.33
But Sarah Palin?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.34
Puleeze.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.35
This whole rally is political in nature, just shy of the midterm election 2 months away.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.36
It's a fucking smokescreen to rev up the tribe and get radicals elected.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.37

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.38
i love it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.39
where was anything political mentioned at the rally?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.40
Ive watched the whole thing and all that is spoken about is love for the founding principles, love for our veterans, the honorable gift of charity, and sacrafice that made america free.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.41
If you take issue with that, then you are the one who is full of hatred.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0241.42
get a clue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0242.1
It is obvious to any thinking American that we have lost the path of honor..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0242.2
It does not NEED pointed out..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0242.3
especially from the likes of Beck.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0242.4
His pathetic rally doesn't restore anything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0242.5
It is a rally for the simple minded.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0242.6
Talking "honor" is bullshit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0242.7
You either have it or you don't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0242.8
It does inspire disgust to see a Rupert Murdoch lackey speak of honor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0242.9
Who would you prefer?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0242.10
Well?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0242.11
Anyone?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0242.12
Would anyone who disapproved of the rally like to offer an alternative?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0242.13
If not, I suppose we are to assume that there isn't any.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0243.15
if this rally proves anything of the left it is their hatred of freedom.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0243.16
it really is that simple.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0244.43
I didn't watch the rally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0244.44
But I didn't have to, to know Maggie is only another wingnut prone to pulling her opinion out of her ass and waving it around as "fact."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0245.3
That is...

a...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0245.5
really dumb statement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0245.8
It isn't supposed to restore/solve anything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0245.9
It is supposed to bring light to a problem.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0245.11

Its about restoring honor of our country by "we the people".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0246.3
Now reading some of the posts I find it Quite alarming for anyone to say our country doesnt need to take a serious look at restoring its honor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0246.4
Not to mention for Individuals to look at restoring their honor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0246.5
Maybe For some I suspect its all about hatred towards who's asking us to do it(Glenn Beck).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0246.6
For whatever your reasons I sure dont understand you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0246.7
Are you really that Obtuse to whats going on in this country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0246.8
The lack of honesty, integrity, the outright abandonment of character, when a mans word is constantly abandoned, the lack of shame, the ease in which many take advantage of one another.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0246.9
Cant you See that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0246.10
I really dont think theres two meanings of the word honor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0246.11
Its not right honor vs. left honor, red state honor vs. Blue state honor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0246.12
In fact its entirely non partisan.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0246.13
If we cant come together as americans to look at the meaning of honor and seriously take an honest look at where were falling short as individuals and as a nation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0246.14
Then does any of this even matter?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0246.15
Most older generations have never "lost" the meaning of honor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0246.16
Perhaps special invitations should have been sent to the materialistic Generations X, Y and Z reminding them that "honor" starts at home, by honoring your family, your neighbor, your country--not amassing "stuff" and learning to hate and bully when YOU are not the center of attention.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0247.1
It's been decades since Glenn Beck or the Republicans have had "honor".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0247.2
Decades.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0247.3
So then you agree with his wish and attempt to try and "Restore Honor"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0247.4
In order to restore it, you have to have had it....

his only message today was love of america, love of our veterans, and the sacrifice necessary to be charitable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0262.2
nothing political was ever mentioned.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0262.3
you sir, are a piece of scum and should apologize if you have any dignity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0262.10
No sir I will not apologise for my statements.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0262.11
I did not see the whole rally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0262.12
I did not see anything about the troops.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0262.13
What I saw was crap.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0262.14
i suppose you have to be a pile of crap to see crap.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0262.15
if you dont have any substance to your statements, why bother?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0262.16
You just look like a dumbass.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0262.17
If you are good at one thing, it's definitely looking like a dumbass.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0262.18
you obviously didn't watch it though as 90% of the content was honoring veterans for a charity that puts the children of killed military personnel through college.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0262.19
Of course, you have a problem with that message, right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0263.1
Dr. Glenn Beck?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0263.2
Oh PUUUUULLLEEEEZZZZ!!!!!!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0263.3
Beck needs a doctor!(shrink)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0263.4
His "faith" recipient just addressed Beck as "Dr." Beck.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0263.5
What a crock of steaming liquid shit!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0263.6
Gotta change the chanel...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0263.7
these people are just too painfully ignorant.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0263.8
more loons attacking the person and not the message.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0263.10
they shit in every thread that honors soldiers and country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0263.11
you must expect it of them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0263.12
The rally is about honoring soldiers?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0263.13
Who's the guest speaker for that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0264.1
You know how I know this event will succeed?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0264.2
Every left wing psycho on this board is attacking Beck, and not his message.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0264.4
So far, his "messages" have been replete with innuendoes at best and blatant accusations at worst that Liberals=ALL BAD; Conservatives=ALL SAVIORS.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0264.5
It's pure rot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0264.6
What?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0264.7
Clearly you haven't watched any of it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0265.7
marcus lattrell, among various retried marine and air force personnel both officers and NCOs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0265.8
if you didn't watch it, you are just looking like an idiot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0266.1
I've been watching the rallies and all the anti-beck rally people were WAY off base with their assumptions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0266.2
Its not even politicial.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0266.3
It actually is about some principles and celebrating those such as Faith, Honor, and Charity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0266.4
Some of you truly are just lost individuals who have nothing but hate and are so blinded by that hate that you can't see something when its right in front of you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0266.5
All you see is "Evil Beck" and make yourselves out to be very petty individuals for attacking him when he is actually sending out a good message at this particular rally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0266.6
I pray that you can all get over your hate and celebrate the principles of equality, faith in each other and something greater than ourselves, hope that we can all come together across political lines in the name of charity, and love for our fellow citizens that this rally has been honoring for the last 45 min that i've watched it on facebook.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0266.7
One can only imagine the screaming protests if Keith Olbermann had rallied the country in the name of honor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0267.8
what kind of fucked up fantasy world do you live in?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0268.8
Not really...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0268.9
all 12 people who would have showed up would have been asking where is the free dinner.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0269.1
Here comes Alveda.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0269.2
The "token" King.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0269.3
Hilarious.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0269.4
I don't think Glennie would appreciate your comment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0269.5
He seems to think she's One of You.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0269.6
Are you admitting she's just a token speaker?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0269.7
Do you think Glennie paid her?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0281.1
I watched part of the Rally on C-Span.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0281.2
It was huge - hundreds of thousands of people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0281.3
I doubt you watched any of it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0281.4
I saw the black preacher recipient of the "faith" medal refer to "Dr. Beck" on C-span.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0281.5
You do not know enough to speak intelligently or accurately on what I know.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0282.1
Considering that you persistently prove that you know very little, there is little occasion to comment on what you know.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0283.1
I watched a good amount of it since nothing else was on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0283.2
His speech could make a good drinking game, take a shot every time he says crossroads, God, and invokes one of the Founders.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0283.3
I
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0283.5
when he said the settlers arrived 5,000 years ago.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0283.6
I'm sure a great part of the audience did a double take as Beck let some of his Mormonism into the rally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0283.7
Though they didn't show the crowd as a whole very much, I noticed a lack of something.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0284.43
So you really believe anyone attending intends to vote for a Democrat?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0284.44
Or approves of Obama?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0284.45
Gullible-itis has become epidemic.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0285.9
I have the same "freedoms" that I've always had.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0285.10
People like you talk as though we live in a Leninist state.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0285.11
Educate yourselves, please.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.1
It is always interesting to me the vitriol of the ignorant.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.2
People who will jump on the bandwagon of hate because an individual they disagree with is receiving prominence...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.3
or in many cases only think they disagree with them because they were told they should.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.4
Glenn Beck is an easy target for ridicule.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.5
The way he chooses to bring a message out is all too often a little too flamboyant, a little carried away.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.6
And in the process, unfortunately, his message is lost because of this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.7
I applaud Glenn Beck, and this rally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.8
Any rally that brings out the little dark secret that this nation has lost all sense of value and honor is OK by me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.9
Because we have.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.10
As I've said several times, if it were anybody but Glenn Beck leading the charge, I'd agree wholeheartedly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.11
But he has a clear agenda.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.12
End of story.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.13
So what you are saying is, if you heard the speeches on the radio you would be applauding...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.14
but because the speaker is someone you dislike - you dismiss it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0286.15
Got it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0287.21
sure why not?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0287.22
Now answer my questions and stop dodging.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0288.20
I haven't stated any "facts" here at all; only opinions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0288.21
But I don't expect someone as dumb as you to see that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0289.11
trust me, it's obvious enough.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0290.1
Restoring Honor means?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0290.2
It suggests that honor was taken, if honor can be taken, who took it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0290.3
Seems to me, and I only watched a short time, this was another in a series of events where uber-patriotism and God are used to appeal to the emotions of the people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0290.4
It reminded me of this well known remark, ' When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0290.5
Of course I'm not suggesting Beck or those who organized today's event or past 'tea parties' are fascists, but they do put on events based solely on emotion which appeal to those who seem to want to hear simple solutions to complex and myraid problems.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0290.6
Though the stage included a bit of diversity, when the camera pans the crowd there were only white people in view, and most appeared well fed and dressed in middle-class attire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0291.7
based on that statement, would you say george washington was a fascist?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0292.13
What specific part of the rally do you not agree with?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0292.14
Stop the ad hominem for one damn minute and post something legitimate...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0292.15
please.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0292.16
The freedom of speech part.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0293.8
i think we have a winner.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0294.6
you obviously didn't watch the rally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0294.7
Nothing political was mentioned in any way shape or form.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0294.8
Keep making yourself out to look like a hateful piece of shit like huggy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0294.9
Really, keep going.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0294.10
The fact that nothing currently "political" was said means squat.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0294.11
The entire world knows EXACTLY what Glenn Beck represents.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0294.12
Sure, he can turn on the sappy I love America BS and hoodwink his adoring fan club into weeping right along with him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0294.13
But I'm from the generation where when people said it, they actually meant it, and didn't turn around the following week and say something insulting and ugly against some person(s) who happen to have a different political viewpoint.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0294.14
Glenn Beck doesn't fool me one single bit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0294.15
AND, neither does Sarah Palin.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0294.16
AND neither does 500,000 supporters who turned out to lap it up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0295.14
why do you hate the children of veterans?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0296.14
I haven't seen any of it yet.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0296.15
I'm sure it will be the top priority of the 24/7 news cycle for at least a week.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0297.8
I mean his daily "messages" on FauxNews.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0298.3
I call shenanigans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0298.4
You clearly don't know EXACTLY what Glenn Beck represents - but it would be quite revealing of what you represent if you stated in plain English what you think he represents.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0299.9
I rest my case...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0300.10
Keep it comin'
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0300.13
That's two...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0301.5
i rest my case too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0301.6
you are too big of a retard to answer my various questions ive posed to you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0301.7
well done, you make your fellow filth proud to be filth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0302.8
Glen Beck is no George Wasington.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0302.9
BTW, are you dishonest, or have reading comprehension problems?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0302.10
"Of course I'm not suggesting Beck or those who organized today's event or past 'tea parties' are fascists..."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0303.9
ok.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0303.10
so can you answer the question please?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0304.8
no asswipe, you fucktard friend bodecca called her a "token"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0304.9
Well, shiite, why didn't you just say so?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0304.10
Sorry, sweetheart, but most of us don't read the thousands of postings every day in order to pluck out exactly the one you're referring to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0304.11
But hey, my bad.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0304.12
It's not like you ever have anything bad to say about black people, so we all assume you just love Alveda too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0305.1
Oh.The.Horror!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0305.2
Promoting and defending The Constitution!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0305.3
Honoring the Troops who have served our country and protected our liberty!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0305.4
No wonder Maggie opposes Beck.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0305.5
--->whoosh---> You never disappoint, Bo.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0306.6
so you don't disagree?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0306.7
Interesting.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0307.1
Still waiting for Maggie Moron to explain what Glenn Beck represents.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0307.2
*crickets*
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0308.1
In all seriousness Maggie...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0308.2
What are you moaning about?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0308.3
You are disparaging speeches you haven't heard...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0308.4
saying you agree with others thoughts, but not if you don't like them...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0308.5
That's not saying much about the foundation of your opinions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0309.1
And what credentials does Glenn Beck possess to make him an authority on what constitutes honor?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0309.2
Good question, try asking one of the 100,000+ that showed up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0309.3
The people that watch FOX are simple minded.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0309.4
Some of these simple minded people start thinking that an infotainment talking head is a god.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0309.5
It is a sad reflection on America.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0309.6
Maybe someone should hold a self-serving and self-promoting rally to restore intelligence to America?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0310.16
I too won't apologize for anything I say about Glenn Beck.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0310.17
He gets paid a lot of money to be a troublemaker, and he does it very well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0310.18
If you don't think he had a strong motive for doing this rally now, on this day, then I'm pretty sure that bridge in Brooklyn is still for sale.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0311.10
that didnt answer my question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0311.11
ill use caps so you can maybe understand better:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0311.12
WHAT DID BECK SAY AT THE RALLY THAT IS A BAD THING FOR AMERICA?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0312.16
If I didn't know the speaker, you would be correct.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0312.17
But I do know him and what his motivation is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0312.18
It's therefore a moot point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0313.1
Don't hold your breath waiting for Maggie to answer your question, Liberty.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0314.10
so what did he say at the rally that is bad for america?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0315.7
Read, think and then post.

But of course I expected everyone to jump up and try to claim that I was comparing Glenn Beck to the Hitler everyone knows as the dictator who marched across Europe and planned the Final Solution, while I was merely pointing out that if people don't have facts and will ONLY listen to propaganda, they WILL BE drawn to a charismatic personality.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0346.2
In all honesty, there was much about Obama's charisma that people ONLY voted for, which is equally as wrong, in my opinion.

Organizers pulled event permits for up to 300,000 people, and expected at least 100,000 to show up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0375.17
Beck said he had heard the crowd was between 300,000 and 500,000, "and if that's coming from the media, God only knows."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0375.18

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0375.21
Sgt. David Schlosser, spokesman for the U.S. Park Police, said it's extremely difficult to estimate crowds of this magnitude, given their fluctuations throughout the day and the fact that some are simply tourists.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0375.22
"We are not the event organizers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0375.23
We are merely the police officers for the event," Schlosser said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0375.24
"It's a better policy not to provide crowd estimates.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0375.25
It doesn't offer us anything from an operational standpoint."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872006_0375.26
The size of Saturday's crowd does, however, matter to Beck and other organizers who say the turnout is indicative of American's growing anger with the direction the country is headed under President Barack Obama and a Democrat-led Congress.

Then again maybe he was just a low-life that couldn't get along with anyone of the wrong color.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0018.7
Maybe he feels everyone hates him because he's black
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0019.11
I think race was simply an easy answer for him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0019.12
I don't think he was necessarily racist to begin with.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0019.13
It's possible, but we don't have enough to data to say either wasy so we can only speculate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0019.14
You'd be surprised what extremely sad people are capable of when they start to pin their problems on the wrong people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0019.15
They turn hate into violence.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0033.1
It doesn't sound like he killed people simply because they were white.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0033.2
The irony here is that if it had been a white man killing black people with the same circumstances, you would have made it a racial issue, Ravi....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0033.3
no doubt about that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0033.4
Your stereotypes run deep, don't they?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0033.5
I thought I was pointing out your stereotype, Ravi.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.1
Got any PROOF of that Skippy?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.2
"You probably want to know the reason why I shot this place up," Thornton said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.3
"They treat me bad over here, and they treat all the other black employees bad over here too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.4
So I just took it into my own hands and I handled the problem," he said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.5
"I wish I coulda got more of the people."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.6
The guys a real idiot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.7
I mean, why did he kill himself?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.8
I'm sure eric holder would have had all the charges against him dropped.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.9
Sounds like this nutter was racially motivated to be sure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.10
But the primary issue here is that he was a nutter who decided to kill people who pissed him off.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.11
What motivated him to target Whites is actually not all that important.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.12
Nutters often target one group or the other.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.13
Woman are the most targeted demographic by serial murderers, regardless of race.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.14
And coworkers (also regardless of race) are the people most frequently targeted in work-related mass killing events like this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.15
If the place had been manned by Black people?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.16
It's entirely possible this nutter would still have killed everybody he could find.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.17
We'll never know, really.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.18
Maybe the White people drove him crazy at work, but I kinda doubt it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.19
He was nuts first.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.20
His targets (and his stated motivation) are just based on who was around him to become targets would be my guess.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.21
In this guy's case?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.22
It was White people he could blame, and therefore attempt to justify his murderous urge.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.23
Co-workers are often the targets in work-related murders?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0034.24
Sorry, for some reason it's funny that was pointed out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0035.1
He was just a disgruntled common thief who got caught stealing beer (on video), got fired, mass murdered, who happened to be black.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0035.2
No more, no less.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0035.3
Onto the next roadside attraction.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0035.4
exactly
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0036.1
Other then the fact that he bragged to his mother that he killed white people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0036.2
Was that thru a medium?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0036.3
Cause he's dead.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0037.7
Actually, he was more playing the VICTIM, the MARTYR.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0038.2
You have to open your mind to the distinct possibility that accusations of "racist" against whites themselves come from the racist motivations of non-whites.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0038.3
I know, you have to connect a few dots there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0038.4
But that's what's going on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0039.4
If you don't know what happened, why do you comment?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0040.1
There was no racism at his workplace.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0040.2
We've elected a black President, we are in the "post-racial" era, remember?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0041.5
That could be true in some cases but I imagine it is actually pretty rare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0042.1
Out of 69 dock workers only four were black and I'd hate to be one of the three still there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0043.6
Maybe but when a guy goes off and kills a bunch of People and after the Fact he and his Family say it was because of Racism.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0043.7
when that Person never reported any such problems to his Job or Union.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0043.8
You have to wonder if maybe this is not one of the "rare" times.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0044.2
only 4 eh, well lest see blacks are 11% of the population.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0044.3
So 7 would have been an exact Fair representation of Blacks to white with 69 total Employees.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0044.4
4 is low but not terribly so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872271_0045.1
He claimed racism at his other jobs too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.1
According to them, the ONLY trustworthy news source is Fox news.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.2
I mean, any station that reports the news that doesn't slant their way is obviously liberal biased.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.3
Couldn't the the right be saying the exact same thing about the liberal biased media?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.4
UCLA did a study a few years ago which proved liberal bias.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.5
CBS, NBC, ABC didn't do any story on the Black Panther fiasco, nor the follow up with the A.J. I guess it wasn't newsworthy enough for the liberal media.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.6
So I'll ask this again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.7
Which is more likely, be honest...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.8
That ALL media, except for Fox news is biased.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.9
While Fox news is the only one reporting fair and even coverage of every story
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.10
OR
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.11
Or there are biased news on both sides, Fox on one side, MSNBC on the other and everything else just falls in between.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.12
Step back and give me an honest answer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.13
Which one seems more plausible?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.14
It might be wise to just throw out the labels and ask why a story is or is not covered.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0027.15
What seems plausible is that the gatekeeppers are still keeping the gates.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0028.1
I think white conservatives are the last one I need explaining racism to me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0028.2
When you focus nearly 95 percent on racism against whites you draw ridicule from educated people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0029.1
Then you oppose Affirmative Action.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0029.3
Affirmative action is a liberals way of saying your inferior in a "nice" way.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0030.3
Ah another liberal being a racist.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0030.4
Implying he does not need to listen to conservatives why?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0030.5
Because we are all racist?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0030.6
You do realize thinking like that is just as bad as thinking an entire race is inferior right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0031.1
Fox is not news, it's republican propaganda.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0031.2
Msnbc is not quit as bad, but their sophomoric ways expose them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0031.3
Fox at least pretends with the fair balanced line for the moron tea baggers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0031.4
Fox is biased to the right, I will not deny it, but they are far more Fair and balanced than CNN or LOL MSNBC. If you actually watch Fox news, Not the commentators like hanity and what not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0031.5
I mean the Hard News part.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0031.6
They are always very fair, and always have both sides of a story, and both sides represented by their guests.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.1
Just got done watching a Segment on CNN about the NAACP vs Tea Party controversy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.2
As you all know the NAACP is alleging that Tea Party Rallies are "rampant with overt racial messages and signs"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.3
So they had 2 African American men on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.4
1 from the Tea Party and one from the NAACP.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.5
The segment lasted maybe 7 mins, and CNN allowed the guy from the NAACP to about 5 mins of that time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.6
He Repeatedly claimed the Tea Party is rampant with Racism.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.7
During the entire 7 mins CNN was showing 3 different signs from a tea party rally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.8
Over and Over.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.9
Just 3, which were mildly racial.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.10
The worst had a picture of what looks like an African Native doing a dance and said Obama Care with the C as a hammer and sickle.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.11
One said "Send oBUMa back to kenya", and the other one was not racial at all but made Obama look like a Nazi or Soviet style propaganda picture basically.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.12
So after letting the Guy from the NAACP talk nearly the whole time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.13
They finally let the Guy from the Tea Party talk.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.14
He of course said that CNN and the NAACP were purposely focusing on a handful of Signs and ingoring, and even deliberately not showing the Hundreds of other signs that were not even remotely Racist.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.15
now as there is video on the internet of CNN doing just that before.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.16
I have no reason to assume anything other than they are doing just that right now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.17
Interestingly enough the NAACP is also claiming there were more than one sigh that read "Lynch Obama" and "Lynch Holder".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.18
One problem.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.19
NOBODY has been able to produce a single photo of these alleged signs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.20
In Fact, I can not remember the guys name, but someone has offered 100,000 Dollars to anyone who can produce a picture of the alleged signs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.21
Please people in todays world of A camera in every phone.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.22
There is NO WAY in hell there were signs that Read "Lynch Obama" or "Lynch Holder" and nobody got a picture of them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.23
Simply no way in hell.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.24
This is clearly a complete Fabrication, and it is also Clear CNN and the Rest of the Liberal Media are continuing to cherry pick signs from Tea Party rally's, and try to Paint the Tea Party as racist.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.25
Very disturbing that such a large segment of our Media, is not only Biased, but actually working for the Democrats.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.26
Actively Slanting stories to try and Destroy the Tea Party.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872357_0032.27
They should all be Ashamed, and have no Right to call themselves objective.

Bill Maher Saturday said America loves its military members the way disgraced football player Michael Vick loves dogs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0001.2
In his HBO special "Bill Maher...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0001.3
But I'm Not Wrong," the outspoken comedian went on a vulgarity-laden two-minute rant against Republicans and the troops.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0001.4
BILL MAHER: For the longest time, every Republican election has been based on some sentimental bulls**t: the flag, or the flagpin, or the Pledge, or the, "It's morning in America."

Bill Clinton got a blowjob in the Oval Office.

And when that happens, it hurts the feelings of our troops.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0001.8
And then Tinkerbell's light goes out and she dies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0001.9

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0001.10
Are you kidding?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0001.11
The troops, we pay them like s**t, we f**k them and trick them on deployment, we nickel and dime them on medical care when they get home, not to mention the stupid wars that we send them to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0001.12
Yeah, we love the troops the way Michael Vick loves dogs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0001.13
You know how I would feel supported if I was a troop overseas?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0001.14

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0001.15

Why don't you go look at the number of soldiers who have had to stay well beyond their initial employment contract.

Or why don't you go talk to Pat Tillman or countless other families who can't get the truth from the Military about their loved ones death or get the benefits that they well deserve.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0002.24

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0002.26
He's ranting against people like you likely.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0003.1
Oh, and never mind the fact it took years to get our troops serving overseas to get proper body armor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8872946_0003.2

Saying he stuck his foot in his mouth, implies that he feels sorry or embarrassed about what he said.

I highly doubt he is either.

What a retarded poll.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873009_0020.2
First off - MA was predominately about local politics (the same reason that a Democrat won that NY seat in a Republican stronghold) - local issues and someone who LISTENED to what the people were saying - economy, jobs, deficits etc. Partisan morons on both sides are try to make it into party referendums or a referendum on the President.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873009_0020.3
Yet President Obama still enjoys wide approval by the MA voters.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873009_0020.4
The other issue - MA's feelings about healthcare reform is also somewhat colored by the fact that MA has it's own affordable healthcare program in place so it's far less of a priority to it's citizens than economy and jobs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873009_0020.5
If you really think Obama is a "radical socialist" you really need to bone up on your history.

Barry suffers from Narcissistic Personality Disorder and thus he can't fathom that the voter's anger in MA would ever possibly be directed at him and at his administration run amuck.

For one thing, sex offenders lie about their past.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873788_0026.6
For another, they prey upon the vulnerable, the young, the weak.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873788_0026.7
Drug addicts, people who aren't very smart or have emotional issues, etc.

I think it's a matter of educating more than anything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873788_0026.14
We have to stop the government from promoting promiscuous behavior, we should actively campaign to educate young women about the dangers they can be faced with, and teach them how to keep their kids safe.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873788_0026.15
And #1 is to avoid bringing people into the home where the kids are.

He make go well over the top to make specific points (like when he announce he was supporting Ross Perot during the 1992 election and spent the whole first hour in that character just to prove a point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0045.12
The fact is that Rush is just a radio talk show host.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0045.13

There is the contradiction, by being bombastic you are in effect doing it for shock value, and facts just are not really shocking so to get the shock you have to exaggerate and take a lot of artistic licensing to make it so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0046.1
Are you advocating that she is censored?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0046.2
Would you like to tweak the First Amendment a little to prevent people from saying those things?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0046.3
Or are you just advocating that the President stand up and condemn a mean-spirited comment that was said about a conservative commentator?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0046.4
A comment that was spoken by an individual that was not a representative of his administration.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0046.5
Because, if Obama is required to condemn mean-spirited comments that are made by citizens that are not part of his administration, then he's got a lot of apologizing to do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0046.6
He can start here:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0046.7
I HOPE RUSH LIMBAUGH IS RUN OVER BY A STEAMROLLER AND THEN HIS FLATTENED CARCASS DEVOURED BY HUNGRY WOLVES.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0046.8
Because that is a pretty mean-spirited comment, if I might say so myself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0046.9
One might say that apologizing is pretty much his stock and trade.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0046.10
Or maybe he can only do that when he leaves the country, not within it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0046.11
Can't argue with that, but isn't it a bit hypocritical to complain about it while at the same time demanding it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0047.1
It doesn't matter how many times you show the brainwashed Ditto-Dopers actual quotes of LimpBoy saying he hopes Americans are in PAIN from the loss of their jobs and the PROLONGING of the Bush Depression so he can in "EUPHORIA" watch the suffering of the American people, they still parrot their programming that LimpBoy was talking about "policy" rather than SPITE.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0047.8
since I'm a "liberal" (according to many on here) I was somehow breaking an unwritten rule by laughing at the stupid nonsense jokes instead of whining about who said what and who laughed at it?

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0047.11
I would say if you cared to bone up on political ideology per se, as opposed to just issue by issue positions, you would probably end up being more conservative than not.

He didn't distance himself from the rhetoric.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0068.9
he continued to attend the church after he made the comments.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0068.10

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0068.11
He also said whites started aids to kill the blacks and Obama did not stop attending the church.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0068.12
Nice to see you defend not only Obama for being associated with the lunatic, but the lunatic himself.

With all the pastors that have made that claim lately, I wonder how people can still go to those specific churches.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0068.15
because they believe the rhetoric.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0069.1

Thank you for putting words in my mouth, but no, I was not implying that the right doesn't do it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0070.2
What I was saying is that that particular tactic is thematic of left-wing respondents.

That's all I meant.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0070.4
I have not noticed that is "thematic" in right-wing respondents.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0070.18
She argued by example that wishing a conservative would die, was, if not a common tactic, at least one in their bag of tricks by showing they had used before.

The issue was the Golf Reporter's comments.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0070.22
The issue was raised about the right being as upset as with the Sykes comments and this was the response.

As for the private school deal since we attacked McCain for living the high life, he had to put it back on obama for sending his kids to private school so therefore obama is hypocrit instead of discussing the real issue behind the voucher program.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0070.49

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0089.18
Really everyone on here is hypocrit including me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0100.1
I just found out Wanda was black...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0100.2
maybe she has a good reason to hate on Rush the racist.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0100.4
Not that I think she meant it as anything but a joke.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0100.5
Damn, you guys have been milking this all week.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0100.6
how is he racist?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0100.7
hating on Rush is one thing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0100.8
Wishing him death is something else.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0100.9
and on national television, no less.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0101.6
They'll milk it until a new "faux outrage" can be found.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0101.7
'Tis the way of politics, everyone else has to be out to get you, and your own leaders can do no wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0102.1
so the democrats hate Rush as much as the Jews hated Hitler?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0102.2
Some may...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0102.3
some Reps may to...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0102.4
you never know.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0102.5
Maybe Wanda does.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0102.6
How do you feel about anyone that wants you to fail?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0102.7
How do you feel about terrorists who say Death to America?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0102.8
Or how would you feel about a president who lied us into a war and got thousands of soldiers wounded and killed, or a radio host who was in on it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0102.9
Seems the last time a soverign country was invaded like that was when Hitler invaded Poland for no reason.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0102.10
And we don't hate Rush anymore than he hates us.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0103.10
1. Obama's pastor said "God damn America".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0103.11
Obama continued to support him by attending his church and you still voted Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0103.12
2. PROVE Bush lied.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0103.13
Oh that's right, you can't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0103.14
3. It's an insult to those Hitler murdered that you compare Bush to him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0103.15
4. the last time a sovereign nation was invaded?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0103.16
Did you forget about Iraq invading Kuwait?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0103.17
5. Did Rush say he wants Obama to fail or did the media twist it into him saying he wants America to fail?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0104.16
and Palin sends her kids to brainwash Jesus camps...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0104.18
your point?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0105.5
you have done it now Ravi.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0105.6
The PC police are going to be after you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0105.7
I also love how the right always says we are the PC Police but the first time someone make an un PC comment they are all over them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0105.8
so you think wishing someone dead on national television is a PC issue?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0105.9
or are you just as partisan as you sound?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0105.10
insane is more like it..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0106.18
Haven't caught Palin sitting around yucking it up at someone's kidney failure..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.14
1. Yes, God damn the racist America that owned slaves and did what it did to the indians.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.15
2. Prove Bush lied us into Iraq?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.16
Oh yea, he got bad info.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.17
We all know he cherry picked.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.18
Are you only going to admit it if and after the dems launch a formal hearing or eric holder has an investigation?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.19
Because if we do, I god damn bet you a thousand dollars that you'll pull a 180 and start crying how we are wasting money on a partisan investigation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.20
Fucking punks don't realize we know the games you fucking play.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.21
3. Didn't one of you ask if we hate Rush as much as Jews hate Hitler?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.22
What a fucking hypocrite you are.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.23
And yes, I compare Bush to Hitler.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.24
Hitler created his own 9-11 like Bush let 9-11 happen so he could lie us into war.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.25
Read PNAC you dumb fuck?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.26
5. Saddam had a reason to invade Kuwait, you just don't know what the reason is, you stupid brainwashed American who only gets Bush's side of the story.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.27
6. Yes, we know you all want Obama to fail.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.28
And, we know that if Bush or McCain or Romney or Rudy were in charge, they'd be doing the same thing Obama is doing, only they would be pissing more money away on their buddies and Obama's spending is being spent in America.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.29
but that's speculation so you'll say i'm wrong, but time and time again we've seen that you guys make everything political.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.30
Hell, I've even seen Pelosi do this very same thing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.31
When they weren't in power, they didn't like the Nuclear Option.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.32
Now that she's in power, she likes the nuclear option.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.33
And the GOP was saying the same things we say about Bush when Clinton went into Kosovo.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.34
Only the GOP were wrong and we were right about Bush.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.35
Did you punish the GOP for being wrong on Kosovo?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.36
No you did not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.37
Because you are a hack with a political agenda, just like the rest of us.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0111.39
The douchebag of the year wants God to damn America.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0112.1
Hmm...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0112.2
how many times have cartoons wished someone dead...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0112.3
I lost count.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0112.4
What about sitcoms...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0112.5
too many to bother counting.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0112.6
What about talk show hosts...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0112.7
at least half their jokes could be considered a "death wish" on someone.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0112.8
I am certain Rush has made jokes about it in the past (thus why he shut up about it).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0112.9
Thousands of songs about wishing someone dead...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0112.10
bah!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0112.11
Seriously...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0112.12
censorship at it's finest, that's all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0112.13
that waddn't no cartoon baby that was your elected leader,, the most powerful man on the planet..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0113.14
Again I post this question: Would you rather SkyNet be in charge or someone who is human?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0114.15
pretty dumb question if you ask me and you did,, what I want is a human in charge who can behave himself publicly with a little decorum...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0114.16
what he does in private is his own business.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0114.17
laughing outloud about "jokes" about the kidney failure and subsequent death of a talk show host everyone knows he and the left dislikes is not appropriate...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0114.18
it's the "politics of ridicule" it's disgusting.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0130.1
Kidney failure is not a death wish.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0130.2
Millions of people live with kidney failure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0130.3
Get over yourselves before your brains explode.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0130.4
for how long??
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0130.5
I dunno, why don't you call someone who has it and ask them how long they have to live??
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0130.6
You insensitive twit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0130.7
One of my brothers had it when he was a child and had to spend a year in bed...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0130.8
he's fine now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0131.1
not what I said at all...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0131.2
But what you did say is only possible with a machine, humans (all natural life actually) cannot be preprogrammed, and cannot be expected to be exactly the same.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0131.3
So, if you want them to only laugh at approved times, not fart, not make any mistakes, not bat an eye at the wrong time, not wink in the sunlight, not have a "trouser malfunction", not to anything that offends anyone...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0131.4
you have to have a machine, there is no other way, period.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0131.5
yep!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0131.6
your train has left the station.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0131.7
Hmm...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0131.8
typical it seems, all you can do is attempt to insult...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0131.9
yet you even fail at that since, well, it makes no sense.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0131.10
How is what you are asking for possible without switching to a computer for president?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0131.11
I'll wait for you to figure it out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0132.9
well, baby you're the one acting the expert and all,, people live with kidney disease you says...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0132.10
so I says,, for how long??
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0132.11
seemed like a reasonable question to me you insensitive bigger twit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0133.11
your train has left the station,, you keep trying to put words in my mouth,, now anybody with enough brain matter can read what I wrote and how you interpreted it and know,, that your train has left the station..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0134.1
And yet still no condemnatory statements against Coulter, eh Willow?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0134.2
This isn't outrage, this is made up bullshit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0135.9
Oh, you said they should laugh at "appropriate" jokes, that means they have to be pre-approved, and you said you don't think they should "fart in public"...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0135.10
which means they would have to have a non-farting body, thus mechanical.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0135.11
The only such thing would be a computer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0136.3
when she's elected president get back to me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0136.4
mkay?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0137.10
post it!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0138.5
Oh yeah, we forgot, you think the president should be inhuman...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0138.6

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0139.7

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0139.8
surely it's easy to copy and paste..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0140.1
he should laugh at humor at the appropriate time and the appropriate place,, that's all anyone's ever asked of him...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0140.2
act like a grownup all humans fart too..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0140.3
I expect him not to fart in public either...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0140.4
There it is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0161.1
i'm not talking about sykess,, i'm talking about the guy you voted for,, the most powerful person on the planet,, laughing at the kidney failure and subsequent death of a talk show host that he and the left have made no bones about is their political enemy..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0161.2
how demeaning,, how not to be dignified..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0161.3
Ann Coulter didn't laugh.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0161.4
She said that someone should MURDER a sitting USSC justice.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0161.5
And you are excusing it cause shes "not the president".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0161.6
Obama never said anything about Limbaugh, despite the massive amount of shit Limbaugh has thrown at Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0161.7
did I say I excused it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0161.8
DUmmie..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0161.9
boy you DUmmies are DUmb..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0161.10
I've brought it up multiple times.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0161.11
You haven't condemned it, you haven't said it was wrong of her, you haven't said anything against what she said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0161.12
I don't need you to state whether you've excused it or not, by your actions its clear that you have.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0162.11
I won't let you put words in my mouth..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0162.12
I've said what I've said, and if you have comprehension problems I cannot help you..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0162.13
I've said quite clearly the two are not in the same ball park,, one is a president and the other is a conservative political columnist,, one has power the other does not..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0162.14
now go play in the basement til your mama calls you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0163.11
I never put words in your mouth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0163.12
Of course you wouldn't state you excused it, because you really try very hard to avoid saying anything substantial.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0163.13
But you bluster, and cry, and whine about Obama & Sykes, day after day after day, and can't even bring yourself to criticize Coulter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0163.14
Yeah, thats excusing it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0163.15
If you can't see that, you need to repeat the 2nd grade.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0163.16
Again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0164.14
your train has left the station..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0164.15
if you ask a lib i'm sure they will be happy to lamblast Coulter..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0164.16
I'll take care of the obamalama..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0164.17
that's fair.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0165.15
LMFAO.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0165.16
Thanks for admitting that you are nothing but a partisan asshole.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0166.20
you are most welcome..

glad to make yer day!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0167.20
since you're a partisan hack, why the hell are you complaining?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0168.1
I hope every politician has a coronary!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0169.15
Your one to talk.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0169.16
Funny, I didn't notice you calling out Coulter either, despite you telling everyone to get AIDS and die at some lame attempt at bashing Sykes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0170.13
like calling out coulter is gonna get your goofy guy off the hook...

But by the same token, Sykes never used the exact word "dead."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8873872_0181.5
Since kidney failure is not fatal if treated, it is a greater twist of words to say Sykes wanted him DEAD than to say LimpBoy hopes America fails so he can blame Libs.

According to the dataset of the UK Met Office Hadley Centre (see figure), 1998 was the warmest year by far since records began, but since 2003 there has been slight cooling.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8764412_0067.18
But according to the dataset of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (see figure), 2005 was the warmest since records began, with 1998 and 2007 tied in second place.

Tracking the heat · Why the difference?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8764412_0067.20
The main reason is that there are no permanent weather stations in the Arctic Ocean, the place on Earth that has been warming fastest.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8764412_0067.21
The Hadley record simply excludes this area, whereas the NASA version assumes its surface temperature is the same as that of the nearest land-based stations.

You're quick to jump on the factoid that "the earth isn't warming up right now", but even saying that shows the shallowness of the skeptic argument.

A new paper exposing the myth of 70s global cooling · Over time, William Connelly has been steadily documenting 70s research predicting global cooling.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8764412_0088.4
It's a rich resource but as he admits, could be more accessible.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8764412_0088.5
Now he has collaborated with Thomas Peterson and Jr the liar you are.ohn Fleck to publish The Myth of the 1970's Global Cooling Scientific Consensus, due to be published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8764412_0088.6
The paper surveys climate studies from 1965 to 1979 (and in a refreshing change to other similar surveys, lists all the papers).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8764412_0088.7
They find very few papers (7 in total) predict global cooling.

This isn't surprising.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8764412_0088.9
What surprises is that even in the 1970s, on the back of 3 decades of cooling, more papers (42 in total) predict global warming due to CO2 than cooling.

"Unlike the surface-based temperatures, global temperature measurements of the Earth's lower atmosphere obtained from satellites reveal no definitive warming trend over the past two decades.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.2
The slight trend that is in the data actually appears to be downward.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.3
The largest fluctuations in the satellite temperature data are not from any man-made activity, but from natural phenomena such as large volcanic eruptions from Mt. Pinatubo, and from El Niño.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.4
So the programs which model global warming in a computer say the temperature of the Earth's lower atmosphere should be going up markedly, but actual measurements of the temperature of the lower atmosphere reveal no such pronounced activity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.5
In theory, one could argue that the computer models are accurate, and that the real measurements have some problem.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.6
However this is not the case.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.7
An incredible amount of work has been done to make sure that the satellite data are the best quality possible.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.8
Recent claims to the contrary by Hurrell and Trenberth have been shown to be false for a number of reasons, and are laid to rest in the September 25th edition of Nature (page 342).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.9
The temperature measurements from space are verified by two direct and independent methods....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.10
First, the influence of a man-made doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is small compared to the Earth's natural cooling rate, on the order of only a percent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.11
Second, there is a much more important greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, namely water vapor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.12
Water vapor over the Earth is extremely variable, both in space and in time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.13
Third, the ways in which clouds and water vapor feed back and ultimately influence the temperature of the Earth are, at best, poorly understood.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.14
Fourth, while the whole Earth is indeed in a state that scientists describe as "radiative equilibrium," where the incoming sunlight equals the outgoing infrared radiation to provide a roughly constant overall temperature, the surface is far from this radiative balance condition.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.15
Evaporation and convection processes in the atmosphere transport heat from the surface to the upper troposphere, where it can be much more efficiently radiated into space since it is above most of the greenhouse-trapping water vapor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0075.16
So in short, it is this convective overturning of the atmosphere - poorly represented in computer models of global warming - that primarily determines the temperature distribution of the surface and upper troposphere, not radiation balance."

There has been a very slight cooling, but not anything really significant," Willis says.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.8
So the buildup of heat on Earth may be on a brief hiatus. "
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.9
Global warming doesn't mean every year will be warmer than the last.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.10
And it may be that we are in a period of less rapid warming.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.12
In recent years, heat has actually been flowing out of the ocean and into the air.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.13
This is a feature of the weather phenomenon known as El Nino.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.14
So it is indeed possible the air has warmed but the ocean has not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.15
But it's also possible that something more mysterious is going on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.16
That becomes clear when you consider what's happening to global sea level.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.17
Sea level rises when the oceans get warm because warmer water expands.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.18
This accounts for about half of global sea level rise.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.19
So with the oceans not warming, you would expect to see less sea level rise.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.20
Instead, sea level has risen about half an inch in the past four years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.21
That's a lot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.22
Willis says some of this water is apparently coming from a recent increase in the melting rate of glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.24
But in fact there's a little bit of a mystery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.25
We can't account for all of the sea level increase we've seen over the last three or four years," he says.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.26
One possibility is that the sea has, in fact, warmed and expanded — and scientists are somehow misinterpreting the data from the diving buoys.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.27
But if the aquatic robots are actually telling the right story, that raises a new question: Where is the extra heat all going?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0076.28
If you read the whole article he doesn't sound like he knows if he is coming or going but that sounds about right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0077.1

The real brains are more concerned about global cooling, and they are REALLY concerned about it right now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0130.1
And physics has firmly established the absorbtion spectra of CO2.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0130.2
And the fact that we have had rapid increases in CO2 and CH4 in the past, and the result, in every case, was rapid warming.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0130.3
That the initial cause was trapp volcanics in no way changes the result, simply because now the cause is the activities of man.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0130.4
Like your stand on evolution, your talking points reveal a deep misunderstanding of how science is done, and how conclusions are reached.

Most of us understand science just fine in terms of how hypotheses are tested and how conclusions are reached..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0130.7
I would say it is you that does not understand science.

After all you don't really understand the science behind it as well as your cherry picked experts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0130.11
Therefore it is simply a faith that you have that one group of people is right and you have chosen to ignore the rest, much like a christian only has faith in Jesus' and ignores budha or the spirits native american's believed in.

Atmospheric CO2 causes the earth to retain heat.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0130.13
This was proved experimentally in 1859.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0130.14
We have increased atmospheric CO2 by 40% in the last 200 years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0130.15
We are adding 8 billion tons of CO2 to the atmosphere every year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0130.16
If our atmosphere was that simple you would have your case made.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0130.17
Except our atmosphere is far from that simple.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0130.18
It is truly laughable to watch you people trying to convince yourselves that you understand any of this when you obviously dont' understand even basic concepts like what constitutes an actual correllation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0130.19
Do yourself a favor, take a math class and learn how to derive a correct correlation co-efficient, run CO2 numbers over time with temperature over time and let us know what the number is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0130.20

bolt-eng-DF-170-181110-8770323_0132.18

Energy makes the world go around, especially in todays society.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.2
Electricity is a must have if you intend on living in the United States, with the notable exception of the Amish.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.3
Let it be said though that even the Amish are having a hard time fitting in and are moving further and further west.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.4
We use electricity for a wide variety of essential everyday needs from running our refridgerators (food), heating our homes (shelter), providing lights so we can operate and function around the clock, and to run our televisions (information gathering).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.5
Wether you have electricity or not determines what type of society you live in such as in the industrial world, or the third world.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.6
The question to ask yourself is...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.7
can I live for over a year without electricity?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.8

Oil being the most versitile of the lot is the most coveted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.11
Our society has entwined itself with oil and has become so dependant on it that without it we would not last very long.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.12
Oil provides the means to do everything from transportation to production to providing electricity, and to heating our homes (along with natural gas).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.13
I believe it would be fair to put oil into the same catagory as electricity when it comes to it's effect on society if it became absent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.14
Society would crumble.

Though it would be easier to get by without oil than electricity the effects would be very comparable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.16
Let it be noted that alot of our electricity comes from oil as well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.17
Given the facts about electricity and oil and their effects and contributions to society I cannot understand how energy in the United States has not been nationalized yet.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.18
In todays day and age with speculators and oil companies record setting profits how is it that this is allowed to continue?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.19
I would put forth that in the intrests of the population our energy should be produced, maintained, and provided by our government to ensure an affordable price to all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.20
Now wether the government hires independant contractors to help with this or not would remain to be seen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.21
Would this make us a socialist society?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.22
absolutely.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.23
Would this be a difficult transition?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.25
Would this be beneficial to the population as a whole?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.27
Would the oil fat cats and energy mongers fight this tooth and nail?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.28
without question, yes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.29
In the quest for energy independance I feel that it is a must that we nationalize our energy sector.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.30
To leave it up to individuals to do what is right has not proven to be the answer (greed), leaving it up to wall street has also proven not to be the answer (free market system / capitalism), and leaving it up to government regulations (politics) is not the answer either.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.31
Even dealing with OPEC has proven not to work (foreign policy).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.32
We as a nation of free people need to re-evaluate our energy situation before we are no longer a free people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.33
This I believe is what our government was created to do, protect us from enemies foriegn and domestic, and to maintain a fair and level playing field for all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.34
We are already part way there, we maintain a standing army and now we must follow up with a nationalized energy policy to ensure our way of life, our civilization can survive and thrive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.35
It's funny how you say we'll lose our freedom if we don't give up our freedom.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.36
Where have I heard something like that before...?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.37
Oh, yeah --

bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.41
So, to answer your question, no.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0011.42
Not happening.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0012.1
It is very important for our future.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0013.2
Socialism is a failure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0014.1
SOME things that governmenht do, they do very well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0014.2
I do not think that nationaling the assets of oil compnaies is remotely a good idea, though.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0014.3
There might be one way to test that theory, though., and no nationalization of private peroperty is necessary
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0014.4
The USA still owns plenty of land and offshore locations where there's oil.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0014.5
Instead of selling the right to drill to a private company, let the government try to set up its own oil company.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0014.6
I suspect that the oil won't be brought up out of the ground any more chearply than the private companies do it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0015.7
by nationalizing, the prices would absolutely go, down because if we the people being the govenment decide that oil needs to break even and the government doesn't need to make a profit then the price will definitally go down.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0015.8
Gas will become cheaper when it comes to the profit margin.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0016.1
Oil without question is the lifeblood of our economy and thus society.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0016.2
Far too important to be left in the hands of an inept Government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0033.9
The government doesn't have a profit motive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0033.10
They don't care whether they make a profit, break even, or go in the red.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0033.11
They will simply spend the entire budget allocation on oil production and whether or not its financially efficient will be of no concern to them because another budget will be passed with another allocation in the future.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0033.12
Funding would come from tax dollars, which are theoretically available forever.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0033.13
So if money is lost producing oil, who cares, there's money available forever.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0033.14
As long as oil is being provided, right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0033.16
You could always ASSUME that people would keep the system running properly through their due diligence and their vote, but I don't see that happening anywhere else with government spending so why think it would be different with government-run oil production?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0033.17
OP killer right there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0034.12
Not really.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0034.13
And it sort of supports the OP..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0034.14
although that's not the intention.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0035.1
I'd go out on a limb and say the oil industry is already nationalized.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0035.2
It's become pretty obvious now that the government will financially back stop big companies in the event that they face bankruptcy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0035.3
So if Exxon makes a bunch of stupid mistakes and loses their ass, our tax dollars will prop them up anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0035.4
This way, we don't actually have to CALL it nationalization.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763316_0036.13

My guess is that it will not only be more expensive, it will actually take longer to drill, and end up being more harmful to the environment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763626_0034.1
CFLs will actually cut down on mercury pollution produced by coal burning, and EPA agrees.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763626_0034.2
"By using less electricity, CFLs help reduce mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants, which are the largest source of human-caused mercury emissions in the United States," said agency press officer Ernest Jones.

And nuclear power would produce all the emission free electricity we need without having to use mercury for light bulbs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763626_0035.1
"Recycling programs are already in place in many areas," noted mercury clean-up expert Hogue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763626_0035.2
"Community leaders don't need to reinvent the wheel."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763626_0035.3
If recycling is not possible, used CFLs should be sealed inside a plastic bag and taken to a household hazardous waste disposal site, just as should batteries, oil-based paint, and motor oil, EPA recommends.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763626_0035.4
Web sites such as Earth 911 and Light Recycle can provide local disposal options.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181112-8763626_0036.3

that might be the reasoning for the "stimulus" part of the term "monetary stimulus".

What the fuck are you talking about?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0035.3
You think Milton Friedman was a central planner witch doctor?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0035.5
He worked with and enabled some of the greatest authoritarian economic witch doctors of all time, including FDR....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0035.6
In fact one of Friedman's greatest regrets is that he foisted income tax withholding upon the nation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0035.7
Unlike some, I don't consider Friedman to be an economic demi-god.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0035.8

bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0035.11
In other words, yes, Friedman was for central planning in monetary policy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0035.12
Keynes was too.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0036.7
The point is that since you're so keen on telling everybody to go to college and constantly informing us of your immense understanding of Econ 101, you should know better than anybody the basis you were asking for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0036.8
No point in sucking eggs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0042.16
Friedman wasn't for central planning at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0042.17
He ideally wanted Free Banking.

The point of monetarism was that given that central banks exist, which isn't to say that they should, they should be constrained by binding rules and have any discretion taken away from them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0042.19
Strange to call that being "for central planning".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0042.20
But that's part and parcel of the whole libertarian/anarchist internet culture.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0042.21
Anybody that holds opinions based on contingencies that occur in reality rather than constantly pounding the same extreme views is a "statist".

Problem with Friedman is that he failed to recognize what Basiat did in "The Law"...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0042.23
That given the choice between work and plunder, most people would choose the latter...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0042.24
Which exposes the fatal conceit of monetarists: They actually believe that you can put imperfect humans in charge of the money supply without them rigging the game to benefit themselves and their friends.

I sure you're well versed in the fact that you still can't push a rope.

False analogy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0043.6
It's the entire underlying premise of economic central control in general and Keynesian economics in particular.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0043.7
Fluffing that flawed premise with a flurry of incomprehensible semantics can't change the fact.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0044.5
And now we have a strawman.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0044.6
Is there any fallacy you won't invoke?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0045.4
he advised Pinochet only about how to manage monetary policy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0045.5
In fact, he gave him the same advice he gave our Presidents.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0045.10
he said that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0045.11
Then why be so afraid to prove it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0045.13
and your best example of this would be??
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0046.22
So I take it you're not at all familiar with Friedman or monetarism then.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0046.23
He wanted a k-percent rule so that a computer could control the money supply.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0046.24
The entire point was removing human discretion from monetary policy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0047.6
No strawman at all....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-8748063_0047.7

We spend more money on our Military than the next 10 largest militaries combined.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874189_0024.13
Thats because of our cost of living expenses.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874189_0024.14
We pay our troops and civilian employees/contractors a hell of a lot more than other countries.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874189_0026.4
Yeah thats true we do spend more than the next 10 largest militaries combined.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874189_0026.5
But If I am not mistaken we protect far more interests and humanitarian aid is included in the DOD budget.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874189_0026.6
Also at a time where soldiers are averaging multiple deployments in their first 5 years I dont think a troop reduction is really called for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874189_0026.7
Maybe a war reduction first then we can talk about cutting troops.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874189_0026.8
But positioning another battle fleet by Iran while the tentative outcasting of US troops by Iraq has left over 23000 soldiers in Kuwait plus more in neighboring countries because nobody believes we will be gone long does not signal a promising end to wars in the middle east.

Fucking laughable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874189_0028.1
We need to expand and take better care of our Military, not gut it and decrease it, not having enough Troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan is why things got so fucked up in those places to begin with, we didn't have enough troops to everywhere we needed to be to provide security and we left pockets of those countries open for the insurgents to control.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874189_0029.1
With the end of Vietnam most elements of the Military were slightly pared down, but not as would have normally occured because of the ongoing Cold War with Russia.

31 Americans, 7 Afghans killed in helicopter crash
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.3
By SOLOMON MOORE · Associated Press
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.4
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- A military helicopter crashed in eastern Afghanistan, killing 31 U.S. special operation troops and seven Afghan commandos, the country's president said Saturday.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.5
An American official said it was apparently shot down, in the deadliest single incident for American forces in the decade-long war.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.6
The Taliban claimed they downed the helicopter with rocket fire while it was taking part in a raid on a house where insurgents were gathered in the province of Wardak late Friday.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.7
It said wreckage of the craft was strewn at the scene.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.8
NATO confirmed the overnight crash took place and that there "was enemy activity in the area."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.9
But it said it was still investigating the cause and conducting a recovery operation at the site.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.10
It did not release details or casualty figures.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.11
"We are in the process of accessing the facts," said U.S. Air Force Capt. Justin Brockhoff, a NATO spokesman.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.12
But a senior U.S. administration official in Washington said it was apparently shot down by insurgents.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.13
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the crash is still being investigated.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.14
President Barack Obama mourned the deaths of the American troops, saying in a statement that the crash serves as a reminder of the "extraordinary sacrifices" being made by the U.S. military and its families.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.15
He said he also mourned "the Afghans who died alongside our troops."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.16
The death toll would surpass the worst single day loss of life for the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan since the war began in 2001 - the June 28, 2005 downing of a military helicopter in eastern Kunar province.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.17
In that incident, 16 Navy SEALs and Army special operations troops were killed when their craft was shot down while on a mission to rescue four SEALs under attack by the Taliban.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.18
Three of the SEALs being rescued were also killed and the fourth wounded.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.19
It was the highest one-day death toll for the Navy Special Warfare personnel since World War II.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.20
With its steep mountain ranges, providing shelter for militants armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers, eastern Afghanistan is hazardous terrain for military aircraft.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.21
Large, slow-moving air transport carriers like the CH-47 Chinook are particularly vulnerable, often forced to ease their way through sheer valleys where insurgents can achieve more level lines of fire from mountainsides.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.22
Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Saturday gave the first public word of the new crash, saying in a statement that "a NATO helicopter crashed last night in Wardak province" and that 31 American special operations troops were killed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.23
He expressed his condolences to President Barack Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.24
The helicopter was a twin-rotor Chinook, said an official at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.25
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was receiving his information from an Afghan officer in Kabul.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.26
The crash took place in the Sayd Abad district of Wardak province, said a provincial government spokesman, Shahidullah Shahid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.27
The volatile region borders the province of Kabul where the Afghan capital is located and is known for its strong Taliban presence.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.28
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in a statement that Taliban fighters downed the helicopter during a "heavy raid" in Sayd Abad.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.29
He said NATO attacked a house in Sayd Abad where insurgent fighters were gathering Friday night.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.30
During the battle, the fighters shot down the helicopter, killing 31 Americans and seven Afghans, he said, adding that eight insurgents were killed in the fight.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.31
There have been at least 17 coalition and Afghan aircraft crashes in Afghanistan this year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.32
Most of the crashes were attributed to pilot errors, weather conditions or mechanical failures.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.33
However, the coalition has confirmed that at least one CH-47F Chinook helicopter was hit by a rocket propelled grenade on July 25.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.34
Two coalition crew members were injured in that attack.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.35
Meanwhile, in the southern Helmand province, an Afghan government official said Saturday that NATO troops attacked a house and inadvertently killed eight members of a family, including women and children.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.36
NATO said that Taliban fighters fired rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire at coalition troops during a patrol Friday in the Nad Ali district.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.37
"Coalition forces responded with small arms fire and as the incident continued, an air strike was employed against the insurgent position," said Brockhoff.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.38
He added that NATO sent a delegation to meet with local leaders and investigate the incident.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.39
Nad Ali district police chief Shadi Khan said civilians died in the bombardment but that it was unknown how many insurgents were killed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.40
Helmand, a Taliban stronghold, is the deadliest province in Afghanistan for international troops.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.41
NATO has come under harsh criticism in the past for accidentally killing civilians during operations against suspected insurgents.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.42
However, civilian death tallies by the United Nations show the insurgency is responsible for most war casualties involving noncombatants.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.43
In south Afghanistan, NATO said two coalition service member were killed, one on Friday and another on Saturday.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.44
The international alliance did not release further details.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0003.45
With the casualties from the helicopter crash, the deaths bring to 365 the number of coalition troops killed this year in Afghanistan and 42 this month.

The anti-military left has some diehards in Code Pink that are pissed at Obama for not surrendering to Al Qai'da, but many of the left-wing goons put down their pitchforks because they feel protesting Obama will hurt their overall socialist agenda with non-military issues.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0015.2
They are willing to sit on their hands for Obama in order to ruin our economy and society.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0015.3
If this happened on Bush's watch we would have anti-war protestors on TV and marching around the USA, but not a peep with the "holy one" sitting in the White House.

I do recall Democrats wanted a stupid draft...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0021.1

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0021.5
Afghans had to be involved in revealing the location of this chopper.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0022.3
A slight disagreement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0022.4
The war in Afghanistan was completely necessary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0022.5
If a mistake was made there, it was when the Bush administration diverted our military forces to Iraq in 2003 before the Afghan war as wrapped up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0022.6
Now we are almost having to start over again there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874533_0022.7
It is important that we do the job right so we don't have to go back in 5 or 10 years.

Not trying to be disrespectful at all, but...

My dad was in the Coast Guard.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0008.8
He said it was his way of draft dodging during Vietnam.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0008.9
But he did boot camp, served, swabbed the deck, carried a weapon, arrested people for illegal fishing, stuff like that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0008.10
He still whistles the Coast Guard tune.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0008.11
Coast Guard not actually in the Department of Defense...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0008.12
it was part of the Department of Transportation (!) and now, Homeland Security.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0008.13
I trust the Coast Guard is rough and ready.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0008.14
They guarded me every time I went to work across New York Harbor!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0008.15
But honestly, if someone is trying to be a bad-ass, I figure they go for the Marines, Army's Delta Force or Special Forces, etc. If not, well, Air Force.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0008.16
Though I knew a guy who joined the Air Force so he could join their rescue team, reputed to be pretty incredible.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0008.19
Highly unique military circumstance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0008.20
Interservice rivalry aside, the Coast Guard has some jobs that are as tough as any special operations duty, and can get you killed, whether you get shot at, or not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0008.21
The Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer school has a typical attrition rate exceeding 50%, and it wouldn't surprise me if some of them were able to get through BUDS and become SEALs.; a lot of the mental and physical skills required are similar.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0008.22
The Coast Guard has about 300 Rescue Swimmers deployed world wide, and you'd be surprised at some of the things they do routinely.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0008.23
(It sure includes some things this former airborne infantry grunt would not particularly care to attempt.)

You gotta wonder why Joyce would disrespect his own father's service.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874674_0010.1
Things might have changed but as recent as the late 90s if you were from another branch of service and completed all the training you had to resign from that service and join the Navy in order to be a SEALs team member.

Political Chic, the concept of nation rebuilding after a war worked rather well with Japan and Germany.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874923_0016.2
Germany was a European nation with similar lifstyles and Japan was only a cultural difference.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874923_0016.3
But, the nations we are fighting in now are Islamic and that is a whole other scenario entirely.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874923_0016.4
Cultural and issues can be overcome, but religious fundamentalism, forget it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874923_0016.5
Trying to rebuild a nation that has at its base, a religion that adovcates persecuting or killing you, simply because you are not of their religion, is a waste of time and blood.

We have shed thousands of lives in Iraq and Afghanistan and what have we accomplished?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874923_0016.8
1. We got rid of Saddam Hussein and allowed a Shia dominated government and future ally of Iran to take his place.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874923_0016.9
2. Women are now more oppressed In Iraq.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874923_0016.10
3. Christians are fleeing Iraq because of death threats and killings.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874923_0016.11
In Afghanistan, the government is trying to include aspects of the Taliban back into its fold and women are gradually headed back to being where they were under the Taliban.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874923_0016.12
Closet Christians must still hide their beliefs or face death.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874923_0016.13
Citizens are still being whipped and stoned.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874923_0016.14
Basically, we have only accomplished getting thousands of sons, daughters, fathers, siblings, uncles, aunts and cousins killed for nothing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8874923_0016.15

Okay, this apparently is the POV you hold.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.7
The rest of the post you made contains the regrets and hindsight of men and women involved in the decision to use the A-Bomb on Japan....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.8
and I have no trouble believing they carried a powerful sense of conflict and regret over that choice till they died.

They would not have been human if they did not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.10
I seem to recall even Einstein regretted invention of the A-Bomb.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.11
But emotion alone does not control the questions of ethics and the A-Bomb.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.12
Personally I think it is irrelevant whether or not Japan had a "superior economic/political system" to the US's in 1945.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.13
I don't happen to believe that they did, but either side in a war seeks conquest.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.14
I like to think at least some military people place ethical limits on their warfare behavior.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.15
In that vein, what I am asking is this:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.16
* Was the A-Bomb a useful weapon?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.17
Did the war end faster because we unleashed it on Japan?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.18
* Why was it necessary to drop TWO A-Bombs?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.19
And most urgently:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.20
* Did humans learn anything from the A-Bombing of Japan that military types today can or should reflect upon before firing off the nuclear weapons in their arsenals?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.21
ill bet your dad was relieved it was over.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.22
if Truman had not dropped it and he (your dad) died then your family found he had a weapon that could have ended it, they would have wanted Truman drawn and quatered.

also you wouldn't be here today !!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.24
the Jap Army did not believe we had more that one weapon.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.25
also they were starving their own people to stay in the fight.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0014.26

Truman based his decision on the actions of the Japanese at okinawa, Iwo, and Tarawa.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0027.2
Civilian casualties were respectively 60%, 95% and 90%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0027.3
US casualties, while lower than Japanese casualties, were severe and the battles protracted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0027.4
Iwo is a very small rock, but it took two months to clear.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0027.5
They were budgeting 2 US deaths per square mile.

I have no problem with using the bomb to end it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0027.7
The original target was Germany because there was good reason to believe the Germans would come up with the bomb if we didn't.

What was happening to the Jews was separate from other war efforts, which the german soldiers likely didn't even know about while they were fighting the war.

I still can't understand why it was necessary to drop a second bomb only three days later.

After the first Bomb the Generals that ran the Government REFUSED to surrender.

The Emperor refused to act after the first bomb also.

It is all there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0029.9

Perhaps it was Document 29, where on 11 of July Foreign Minister Togo sent the following 'extremely urgent' message to Ambassador Sato:

"We are now secretly giving consideration to the termination of the war because of the pressing situation which confronts Japan both at home and abroad Therefore, when you have your interview with Molotov [ in accordance with previous instructions] you should not confine yourself to the objective of a rapprochement between Russia and Japan but should also sound him out on the extent to which it is possible to make use of Russia in ending the war."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0057.6
and then on the same day:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0057.8

All the while U.S. interceptors secretly listened in, and made Truman's office aware of the full content of these Japanese attempts yet they went ahead anyway, choosing to test one of each type of their new atomic devices, first Uranium, then Plutonium on the living Human guinea pigs; the old men, the helpless women and innocent children behind enemy lines, away from the theatre of war, away from where the soldiers were.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0060.3
Germany surrendered in April.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0060.4
We had no reason to drop said bombs on Germany.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0060.5
The reality is that it took BOTH bombs to get the Emperor of Japan to over ride his Army Controlled Government and order an immediate surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0060.6
With those bombs we would have starved Japan through the winter killing untold thousands followed by an Invasion of a Home Island which would have seen MILLIONS of dead Japanese civilians and soldiers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0060.7
Japan was teaching her civilians to arm themselves with Bamboo spears and human wave charge any invasion.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0060.10
Japan under the Army had no intention of surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0060.11
What they "offered" through the Soviet Union was a cease fire with Japan keeping everything she still possessed and the return of Japanese home possessions like Saipan and Okinawa.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0060.12
Japan was offering to let us just stop attacking them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0060.13
They would retain all of their Chinese, Korean and other possessions and we would return their home island captures.

There are two simple yet often overlooked fundamental aspects that prove the bombs were not meant to get Japan to surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0060.21
(1) We had their offer to surrender before we dropped the bombs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0060.22
It was the same offer we accepted after we targeted civilians with the A-bombs and dropped them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0060.23
(2) The bombs were not dropped to intimidate Japan.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0060.24

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0061.4

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0074.6
The Japanese simply offered to end the war in place.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0074.7
They would evacuate all territory captured after December 7 1941 and we would return all Territory held by them prior to Dec 7 1941.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0074.8
That simply was not going to happen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0074.9
It is idiotic to think it would happen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0074.10
Once again we did not have a functioning A bomb to drop on Germany before she surrendered and to tell you the truth we had no need to do so, they were not unreasonable fools like the Japanese.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0075.7
there is no doc that says we offered or agreed to any surrender prior to the bombs.

Straight up LIE.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0076.26
Provide a single source to your claim the Japanese offered unconditional Surrender before the Emperor ordered it AFTER 2 Atomic Bombs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0076.27
I have in the source documents the actual meetings of the Japanese Government and their refusal to surrender after the first bomb and their refusal after the second until the Emperor intervened.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0077.13
Bush never claimed Iraq had a bomb.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0077.14

You are a LIAR.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0078.5

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0078.6
I have provided a SOURCE document of the Japanese Governments meetings and then did not offered to surrender at all before either bomb was dropped.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0078.7
They offered through the Soviets to end the war in place exchanging territory they captured for territory we captured.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0078.8

Either this is an accepted, established historical fact or it isn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0085.6
We shouldn't be debating WHAT happened.

I thought we KNEW what happened.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0085.8
I'm very confused by these different scenarios you guys present.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0085.9
If we A-Bombed Japan needlessly, it was not ethical.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0085.10
Or was it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0085.11
Do we agree on that much?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0085.12
I say no.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0085.13
Even though we benefitted from the object lesson/demonstration of US military power, the use of the A-Bomb -- TWICE -- just to flex our post-war muscles was not ethical, if it was not ALSO necessary to force Japan to surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0085.14

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0085.19
which is it????
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0086.1
Personally, I dont think without the dramatic blow of the atomic drops many Japanese military units would have surrendered even if the Emperor had told them to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0086.2
The military often dictated terms to the government, they had large armies undefeated in China, mass killing civilians every day, they might have just fought on dragging the war out and costing everyone more life, (an invasion of Japan would have cost far more life than the drops on both sides) and allowing the Soviets to expand their sphere of influence in Asia.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0086.3
Indeed there was a plot to Kamikaze attack the surrender ceremony on the USS Missouri that was stopped by the Emperors son, (John Toland, The Rising Sun) so even after the drops there were hard core elements willing to fight on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0086.4
The drops (Japan did not know how many more bombs we had) made resistance of any kind almost unthinkable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0086.5
Also, how does President Truman tell a parent your son died, even in a war prolonged by days or weeks, and I had a weapon that could have ended the war immediately but did not use it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0086.6
He couldnt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0086.7
The drops also certainly put a break on Soviet ambitions, they had to think and be cautious about gobbling up territory in the direct post war chaos.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0086.8
They probably stopped an immediate military conflict with the Soviet Union.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0086.9
agreed !!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0086.10
ests were a million American dead in the invasion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0086.11
ests were always wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0086.12

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0086.13

You are arguing the wrong point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0087.19
There was no surrender on the table before the A Bombs were dropped.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0087.20
The ONLY thing the Japanese offered was a cease of hostilities and the return of captured territory.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0087.21
They would hand over what ever they still had from after Dec 7 and we would hand over what ever of theirs we had from before Dec 7.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0087.22
It is a bald faced LIE that the same surrender existed before as after and that we ignored it to bomb them.

I am not asking for a pie-in-the-sky ethical debate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0096.10
I merely want to know, was it necessary or not?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0096.11
Had Japan surrendered BEFORE we bombed there?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0096.12

The ONLY thing the Japanese offered before the A Bombs was a cease fire to move their troops from captured territory while we removed our troops from captured territory.

We demanded an unconditional Surrender just as we did in Germany.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.10
They are not authentic?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.11
What?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.12
You just CANNOT both be right on the FACTS.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.13
It's logically impossible.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.14
He is playing with words.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.15
The Japanese made the following offer through the Soviet Union...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.16
They would cease hostilities and we would cease hostilities.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.17
They would evacuate all territory captured since Dec 7 1941 and we would evacuate all territory that was Japanese before Dec 7 1941.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.18
Further no other action would occur to Japan.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.19
No foreign presence in Japan, no reorganization of their Government, no dismantling of their military.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.20
We refused.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.21
After the First Atomic Bomb they floated a similar plan and we again refused.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.22
After the second Bomb the Emperor intervened in the Governments deliberations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.23
The Army which controlled the Government absolutely REFUSED to surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.24
Even after 2 Atomic Bombs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.25
The Emperor over ruled them and ordered an immediate UNCONDITIONAL Surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.26
Curvelight is pretending that the offer to a cease of hostilities was a offer to surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.27
He is further claiming that because we eventually allowed the Emperor to remain as a figure head in Japan we should not have dropped the bombs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.28
He is using the same intercepts as my source documents and claiming they do not clearly say what they say.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.29
Further I have in my source documents the actual meetings of the Japanese Government and what was and was not agreed to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.30
Who wanted and did not want Peace.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.31
The Army ran the Government and was not going to surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.32
Even after the Emperor agreed to surrender the Army staged a coup and tried to seize the voice recording where the Emperor ordered the surrender and prevent the Emperor from further addressing the Nation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.33
Well, CurveLight, what say you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.34
If RetiredGySgt is right then the POV you and Quartermass have posted here seems less than completely intellectually honest to me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0102.35
If RetiredGySgt is correct on the FACTS, then as far as I am concerned, he is right on the ETHICS as well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0103.25
This business of flinging URLs around isn't getting us anywhere, CurveLight.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0103.26
WHAT exactly is defective about the documents relied on by RetiredGySgt and namvet?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0103.27
Why are THEY not good evidence of what transpired?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0103.28
Are the doctored?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0103.29
Are they incomplete?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0103.30
Is there doubt about their authenticity?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0104.33
I just posted the evidence Japan did not offer an unconditional surrender but you want to claim I'm ignorant of the facts?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0104.34
Lol...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0105.24
No to all those questions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0105.25
He even uses magic intercepts for his claims.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0105.26
He is twisting the information and in some cases outright lying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0105.27
But what is the point if you refuse to even read the documents?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0106.16
I have glanced through all the URLs, sir.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0106.17
Each seems to support the factual allegations the posters have claimed they would.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0106.18
But BOTH scenarios cannot have occurred, and at this point, I am kinda sorta thinking this is as far as I'm gonna get.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0106.19
I'm heavily inclined to believe what you have posted, RetiredGySgt, but I still have some doubts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0106.20
More or less the same place I was in when this thread started.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0124.1
The question of the bombs' role was not in trying to figure out how to end WW2.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0124.2
They were used to figure out how to start what became known as The Cold War.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0124.3
Oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0124.5
You could not think of any better way to demonstrate what an idiot you are.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0124.6
You're one of many who lack basic knowledge about the end of WW2.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0124.7
The bombs were used to prevent Japan from surrendering through a deal with Russia.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0124.8
Why?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0124.9
The US would have had to share the spoils of war and we were not about to do that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0124.10
Also, we were never really allies with Russia as our only common goal was defeating the third Reich in Europe.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0124.11
But feel free to continue calling people an idiot because they say something beyond your comprehension capabilities.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0124.12
It makes you look oh so cool!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0125.13
Excusatio non petita, accusatio manifesta
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0126.12
Shircia, fov huzy deramia!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0127.13
Once again you fucking MORON I have the meetings from the Japanese Government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0127.14
They were never going to surrender to the allies before the A bombs and there were no deals to surrender to the Soviets as the Japanese did not believe they would attack them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0128.10
The info they are pointing to is an incomplete picture.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0128.11
In many ways, what you are saying about both scenarios being impossible to co-exist is exactly what was taking place.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0128.12
There was the "official" position that the nukes were the only way to force japan to an unconditional surrender then there was the more factual position that japan was trying to surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0128.13
In both countries there was a power struggle between the military and civilian leadership, but their agendas were in role reversals.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0128.14
In Japan the civilian side was more apt to seeking peace than the military but in the US it was the military that was pushing for peace more than the civilian leadership under Truman.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0128.15
In regards to your OP question about the "necessity" of the bombs, what does it tell you that every top US military leader has agreed that the bombs were not necessary?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0128.16
And yet you IGNORE the fact that until the second Atomic Bomb was dropped the Japanese had NO INTENTION of surrendering and even after the second attack it took direct intervention from the Emperor to force the Army to surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0128.17
Once again pea brain the Japanese never offered to surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0128.18
The offer to the Soviets to intercede for them with the allies was NOT a surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0128.19
And after the first bomb they made no credible offer either.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0128.20
I have the FACTS to back me up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0128.21
The meetings of the Japanese Government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0133.10
"This memo showed that the Japanese were offering surrender terms virtually identical to the ones ultimately accepted by the Americans at the formal surrender ceremony on September 2 -- that is, complete surrender of everything but the person of the Emperor."

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0133.12
Have you never realized the Potsdam Declaration was designed to inhibit Japan's surrender so the a-bombs could be used?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0133.13
No wonder you are such an idiot: Poor, poor Curvey believes
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0133.14
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Elmer_Barnes">Harry Elmer Barnes</a> whose career as a professor and then as a journalist was aborted by his contentiousness and his cavalier disregard not only for accuracy but also for truth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0133.15
He produced no original scholarly work but synthesized information from his vast reading in a series of prolix and repetitious works on the history of Western civilization.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0134.1
Was it ethical to use the A-bomb on the Japanese?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0134.2
If so, was it ethical to bomb both Hiroshima and Nagasaki?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0134.3
I do not know what is ethical about war.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0134.4
I have never considered the ethics of war.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0134.5
I doubt if any soldier even considers this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0134.6
His main concern is necessity and self preservation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0134.7
As to the dropping of the first a bomb...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0134.8
I wonder if any Jap wrote a poem about the excessive sunburn that the population of Hiroshima experienced?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0134.9
Indeed, that which was of the Sun did shine on the Land of the Rising Sun............
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0134.10
But there are warfare ethics, aren't there?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0134.11
Don't we have them laid out in the Geneva Convention?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0134.12
Don't we teach them at the Naval Academy, etc.?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0135.9
So the documents relied on by CurveLight are suspect, Samson?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0135.10
I have to admit, I hope that you and RetiredGySgt and namvet are right, and Quartermass and CurveLight are wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0135.11
This country has enough to feel shame over without a gratitutous A-Bombing or two to add to that black list.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0136.10
Curvey's only resource is some nut-case-historical-revisionist.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0137.8
Please check your InBox.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0137.9
I'm grateful to you, and so you have a present.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0138.9
I never referenced barnes as a source you lying fuck.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0139.7
So you're relying on Samson to tell you my sources instead of asking me?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0139.8
How much sense does that make?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0139.9
One source is an article from August 1945:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0139.10
"In an article that finally appeared August 19, 1945, on the front pages of the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Times-Herald, Trohan revealed that on January 20, 1945, two days prior to his departure for the Yalta meeting with Stalin and Churchill, President Roosevelt received a 40-page memorandum from General Douglas MacArthur outlining five separate surrender overtures from high-level Japanese officials.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0139.11
(The complete text of Trohan's article is in the Winter 1985-86 Journal, pp. 508-512.)"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0139.12
Samson claimed my "only resource" is barnes when in fact I've never referenced barnes at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0139.13
So you just thanked Samson for outright lying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0140.1
Madeline, have you ever responded to the fact our top military leaders all agreed the bombs were not necessary?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.13
Curvelight's "source" is Mark Weber's IHR Article.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.14
Let's see what Good Ol' Mark is all about, shall we?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.15
Mark Weber:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.16
<a href="http://www.adl.org/holocaust/weber.asp">The Professional Denier</a>
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.18
More than any other propagandist, Mark Weber, 45, embodies the Holocaust-denial movement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.19
An articulate, media-savvy spokesperson with a master's degree in History from Indiana University, Weber got his start in the radical right in 1978, when he took the position of news editor for National Vanguard, a publication of the neo-Nazi National Alliance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.20
In 1979, Weber also began to contribute regularly to The Spotlight, a weekly
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.21
tabloid produced by Willis Carto's Liberty Lobby organization.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.22
His involvement with the IHR also intensified steadily over the years; initially working as a contributor to the now-defunct IHR Newsletter, Weber began serving as emcee for the group's annual conventions in 1984.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.23
In 1985 he became a member of IHR's Editorial Advisory Committee and in 1992 he became editor of the Journal of Historical Review.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.24
Following IHR's break with Carto and the subsequent departure of most professional staff members in 1993, Weber became director of the organization with one professional staff person serving under him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.25
Ahh, yes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.26
Only those as hopelessly stupid as Curvey would use Weber as a resource.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.27
Maybe he has a National Enquirer Article he'd like to present with more credability?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0141.28
Perhaps some Alien in the form of Elvis has an opinion about Ethics and The A-Bomb that Curvey would like to share!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0142.11
What Journal is this CurveLight?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0142.12
Now I am determined to know what the fuck is the deal with these competing documents.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0142.13
Give us the complete citation and I will ask my research librarian to pull it for me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0142.14
Thankies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0143.2
CurveLight, I am not the arbiter here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0143.3
All USMB-ers get to have the same weight given their opinions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0143.4
I'm just asking questions because I'm dumbfounded that there is (apparently) disagreement as to the historical facts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0144.23
Well CurveLight?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0144.24
Is this true?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0144.25
You've relied on reporting by a discredited man?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0145.23
Weber is not my source either you dumbfuck.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0145.24
That's the second time you've falsely accused a source I've not used.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0145.25
But you want to call others stupid......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0145.26
lol.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0146.5
It is an indisputable historical fact that the top US military leaders agreed the bombs were not necessary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0146.6
What do you think about that fact?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0146.7
I'm beginning to doubt the sincerity of your OP since you have side stepped this at least 4 times.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0147.25
You have no leg to stand on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0147.26
Japan NEVER made an attempt to surrender before the Atomic Bombs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0147.27
The only thing they did is offer through the Soviets to a cease fire and a return to pre war borders.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0147.28
They would vacate all captured territory that had from after Dec 1941 and we would evacuate all Japanese territory captured that was owned by them prior to Dec 1941.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0147.29
That is the ONLY offer made.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0148.8
Poor, poor foolish curvey, linked to Mark Weber's IHR article, and doesn't even understand who he's quoting....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0149.8
They were wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0149.9
Once again the Japanese had no intention of surrendering.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0149.10
Even after 2 atomic Bombs the Army which controlled the Government REFUSED to surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0150.8
"Indesputable fact"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0150.9
Like the Holocaust, huh?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0150.10
Your sources also claim that it did NOT happen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0150.11
Idiot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0151.10
Or, they never agreed to any such thing: Curvey's source is bogus: You may as well be arguing with someone that claims it was an "Indesputable fact" that Martians agreed the A bombs were not necessary, and quotes an article from the National Enquirer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0152.1
I don't give a damned if it was ethical or not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0152.2
it ended the war and saved millions of AMERICAN lives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0152.3
bottom line for me.

A former ambassador to Japan, Grews knowledge of Japanese politics and culture informed his critical stance toward the concept of unconditional surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0161.3
He believed it essential that the United States declare its intention to preserve the institution of the emperor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0161.4
As he argued in this memorandum to President Truman, failure on our part to clarify our intentions on the status of the emperor will insure prolongation of the war and cost a large number of human lives. Documents like this have played a role in arguments developed by Alperovitz that Truman and his advisers had alternatives to using the bomb such as modifying unconditional surrender and that anti-Soviet considerations weighed most heavily in their thinking.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0161.5
By contrast, Herbert P. Bix has argued that the Japanese leadership would probably not have surrendered if the Truman administration had clarified the status of the emperor when it demanded unconditional surrender.

Commenting on another memorandum by Herbert Hoover, George A. Lincoln discussed war aims, face-saving proposals for Japan, and the nature of the proposed declaration to the Japanese government, including the problem of defining unconditional surrender. Lincoln argued against modifying the concept of unconditional surrender: if it is phrased so as to invite negotiation he saw risks of prolonging the war or a compromise peace. J. Samuel Walker has observed that those risks help explain why senior officials were unwilling to modify the demand for unconditional surrender.

This review of Japanese capabilities and intentions portrays an economy and society under tremendous strain; nevertheless, the ground component of the Japanese armed forces remains Japans greatest military asset. Alperovitz sees statements in this estimate about the impact of Soviet entry into the war and the possibility of a conditional surrender involving survival of the emperor as an institution as more evidence that the policymakers saw alternatives to nuclear weapons use.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0164.4
By contrast, Richard Frank takes note of the estimates depiction of the Japanese armys terms for peace: for surrender to be acceptable to the Japanese army it would be necessary for the military leaders to believe that it would not entail discrediting the warrior tradition and that it would permit the ultimate resurgence of a military in Japan. That, Frank argues, would have been unacceptable to any Allied policy maker.

Another intercept of a cable from Togo to Sato shows that the Foreign Minister rejected unconditional surrender and that the emperor was not asking the Russians mediation in anything like unconditional surrender. Incidentally, this Magic Diplomatic Summary indicates the broad scope and capabilities of the program; for example, it includes translations of intercepted French messages (see pages 8-9).

Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal was a regular recipient of Magic intercept reports; this substantial entry reviews the dramatic Sato-Togo exchanges covered in the 22 July Magic summary (although Forrestal misdated Satos cable as first of July instead of the 21st).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0166.3
In contrast to Alperovitzs argument that Forrestal tried to modify the terms of unconditional surrender to give the Japanese an out, Frank sees Forrestals account of the Sato-Togo exchange as additional evidence that senior U.S. officials understood that Tokyo was not on the cusp of surrender. [34]

An intercepted message from Togo to Sato showed that Tokyo remained interested in securing Moscows good office but that it is difficult to decide on concrete peace conditions here at home all at once. [W]e are exerting ourselves to collect the views of all quarters on the matter of concrete terms. Barton Bernstein, Richard Frank, and Tsuyoshi Hasegawa, among others, have argued that the Magic intercepts from the end of July and early August show that the Japanese were far from ready to surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0168.3
According to Herbert Bix, for months Hirohito had believed that the outlook for a negotiated peace could be improved if Japan fought and won one last decisive battle, thus, Hirohito delayed surrender, continuing to procrastinate until the bomb was dropped and the Soviets attacked.[38]
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0168.4

Excerpts from the Foreign Ministry's compilation about the end of the war show how news of the bombing reached Tokyo as well as how Foreign Minister's Togo initially reacted to reports about Hiroshima.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0169.6
When he learned of the atomic bombing from the Domei News Agency, Togo believed that it was time to give up and advised the cabinet that the atomic attack provided the occasion for Japan to surrender on the basis of the Potsdam Declaration.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0169.7
Togo could not persuade the cabinet, however, and the Army wanted to delay any decisions until it had learned what had happened to Hiroshima.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0169.8
When the Foreign Minister met with the Emperor, Hirohito agreed with him; he declared that the top priority was an early end to the war, although it would be acceptable to seek better surrender terms--probably U.S. acceptance of a figure-head emperor--if it did not interfere with that goal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0169.9
In light of those instructions, Togo and Prime Minister Suzuki agreed that the Supreme War Council should meet the next day.

An entry from Admiral Tagaki's diary for August 8 conveys more information on the mood in elite Japanese circles after Hiroshima, but before the Soviet declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0169.12
Seeing the bombing of Hiroshima as a sign of a worsening situation at home, Tagaki worried about further deterioration.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0169.13
Nevertheless, his diary suggests that military hard-liners were very much in charge and that Prime Minister Suzuki was talking tough against surrender, by evoking last ditch moments in Japanese history and warning of the danger that subordinate commanders might not obey surrender orders.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0169.14
The last remark aggravated Navy Minister Yonai who saw it as irresponsible.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0169.15
That the Soviets had made no responses to Sato's request for a meeting was understood as a bad sign; Yonai realized that the government had to prepare for the possibility that Moscow might not help.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0169.16
One of the visitors mentioned at the beginning of the entry was Iwao Yamazaki who became Minister of the Interior in the next cabinet.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0169.17
Again Hardliners controlled the Government and had no intention of surrender even after the first atomic bomb.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0169.18
The Emperor wanted better terms before he would agree.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0174.7
They were however willing to surrender with the sole condition that the Emperor retain his throne, we refused that sole condition, dropped two atomic bombs on their cities, and then allowed the Emperor to retain his throne anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0174.8
That is a lie, they demanded 4 conditions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0174.9
After the second bomb and the Soviet attack the Emperor changed it to one condition.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0174.10
Prior to the Atomic bombs they only offered a cease fire and return to Dec 1941 borders.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0175.13
I was fully prepared for you to try and jump on that and had Leahy's quote from his book ready to use in response.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0175.14
What you fail to understand is his prediction that it would not go off has absolutely nothing to do with the fact he said the bombs were not necessary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0175.15
Quentin already posted Leahy's quote so I don't need to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0175.16
So will you respond to the fact our top military leaders all agreed the bombs were not necessary or will you continue to be dishonest and claim I'm citing sources I've not cited?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0175.17
Wait....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0175.18
aren't you the same person that had no idea of the significance the bombs had with Russia?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0175.19
Do you know what else happened on August 9th, 1945?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0176.18
From everything I've read, and talking with people at my Grandpop's lodge, this is the version I believe.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0176.19
I think the Truman Administration did the right thing to save American lives as terrifying as it was.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0177.1
Madeline,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0177.11
I purposefully cited half of Leahy's quote because his prediction the bombs would not detonate have no bearing on his position they were not necessary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0177.12
There was no risk of a failed detonation whether the bombs worked or not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0177.13
If they didn't go off they would have simply looked like conventional duds.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0177.14
It's not like the Japanese military would have said "Look!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0177.15
The nukes didn't go off!"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0177.16
Although any poor sucker who would have opened a dud would not exactly be radiating with joy.......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0178.21
I cannot get any pro-bomb person to answer a couple of questions so maybe you can.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0178.22
If we dropped the bombs to force an unconditional surrender, then why is it the US changed its surrender terms instead of Japan?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0178.23
Do you realize that after the bombs were dropped it was not Japan who changed their conditions for surrender but the US?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0178.24
If it was worth nuking two civilian populations to try and force an unconditional surrender then why did we give up?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0178.25
The nukes didn't change Japan's terms for surrender so why didn't we invade?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0178.26
Why didn't we continue firebombing, blockades and air raids?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0179.5
The Emperor only agreed to the provision of a a surrender with him in control AFTER the first bomb, NOT before.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0179.6
There is NO surrender agreement prior to the first atomic blast.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0179.7
All they offered was to cease hostilities and return to the Dec 1941 lines.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0179.8
Even after the first blast the Emperor did not FORCE the Army to give up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0179.9
He told them to continue to work for better terms.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0179.10
they offered 4 terms which were rejected.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0179.11
After the second Bomb and a Soviet Invasion the Army STILL refused to surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0179.12
It took the Emperor to intervene and even then the Army tried a Coup to stop him
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0179.13
Show us in the Potsdam Declaration where the Emperor's disposition is stated upon agreement of surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0180.1
they wanted to surrender on their terms.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0180.2
what was our offical policy????
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0197.27
I have no idea.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0197.28
Invasion would have cost American lives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0197.29
If it came down, as I understand it did, to American servicepeople dying or Japanese, it is a no brainer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0197.30
Remember Pearl Harbor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0198.1
You're full of shit as I just posted the fact Japan offered the terms for surrender and we accepted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0198.2
Also......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0198.3
Leahy, Eisenhower, and Macarthur all stated the bombs were not necessary for a surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0198.4
Could you explain why we should believe you over them?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0198.5
Your facts and your documentation are wrong.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0198.8
If you know then you should have stated what they were and proven them wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0198.9
You ignored the earlier posting, so I moved it to here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0198.10
Because you have not bothered to read the declassified material from the 1945 strategic planning ops for the Japanese invasion that have been released in the last decade.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0198.11
It turns out that Leahy, Eisenhower, and Macarthur were all wrong, and that Truman made the right decisiohttp://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_downfall3.htmln · .
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0198.12
Now did you really suggest that Japanese offered to surrender in January 1945?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0198.13
Really?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0198.14
Oh, my.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0213.1

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0213.3
A land invasion may well not have succeeded.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0213.4
The casualties were going to be incredible even if the Allied armies managed to consolidate beach heads, much less push inland.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0213.5
The bombs were necessary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0213.6
There is no real argument about this anymore.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0213.7

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0214.12
All Japan offered was to cease the war and return to the 1941 start lines.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0214.13
And after one bomb they still demanded their terms be meet.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0214.14
It took 2 bombs, a Soviet Invasion AND the DIRECT intervention of the Emperor to end the war.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0214.15
Even then the Army attempted a Coup.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0228.1
It was understood at the time that unless the Japanese surrendered, we would lose as many as a half a million to a million of our fighting men to finally defeat the Japanese Empire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0228.2
And the Japanese were not going to surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0228.3
The citizenry was being trained in how to fight to the last man, woman and child.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0228.4
It took the atomic bomb to prove to them that it was futile.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0228.5
And even the first one didn't turn the trick.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0228.6
Compared to how many of OUR soldiers' lives were at stake -- not even counting the many fold MORE Japanese lives that would be lost -- the math alone underscores a tragic (but real) morality in going atomic.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0228.7
A horrible, horrifying and wrenching decision by President Truman?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0228.8
Absolutely.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0228.9

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0228.10
Based on the quantification of human life, the decision was far more moral than the alternative.

We called for unconditional surrender and we got it the day AFTER we dropped the SECOND of the two atomic bombs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0236.17
That we chose to be even moderately magnanimous doesn't change the equation at all.

Not even a tiny little bit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0236.19
The Japanese were permitted to keep their titular head, the Emperor.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0245.28
Now, of course, you being the abjectly and always dishonest lying cowardly pussy that you are will deny the plain words of the text, but the Instrument of Surrender signed by Japan ending WWII is really quite clear:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0245.29
We, acting by command of and on behalf of the Emperor of Japan, the Japanese Government and the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, hereby accept the provisions in the declaration issued by the heads of the Governments of the United States, China, and Great Britain 26 July 1945 at Potsdam, and subsequently to by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which four powers are hereafter referred to as the Allied Powers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0245.30
We hereby proclaim the unconditional surrender to the Allied Powers of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters and of all Japanese Armed Forces and all Armed Forces under Japanese control wherever situated.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0245.33
It was difficult for the Japanese to grant UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER to the Allies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0245.34
It appears to be even harder for you to admit an historical fact.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0245.40
I've already posted the fact Japan offered a conditional surrender we accepted Snitch Bitch.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0245.41
When I said "keep embarrassing yourself" I didn't mean for you to make it your only mission in life.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0246.28
Of course I can't "keep" doing that since I haven't ever started.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0246.29
That's just you lying again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0246.30
Ho hum.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0246.31
I have, however, completely exposed and humiliated you; but you are such a lying PussyPuddle that you are not even aware of how humiliated you should feel at this point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0246.32
Japan did not "offer" the surrender, either, you retarded asshole-licker.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0246.33
We offered it and they were obliged to accept it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0246.34
You cannot get anything straight.

I will continue to ignore your bullshit dishonest spin as long as you continue to ignore the historical reality.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0249.19
Japan SIGNED the Un conditional surrender, PussyPuddle.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0249.20
Need to read it again?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0249.23
End of story.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0262.15
Straight up LIE.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0262.16
Before the bombs Japan wanted us to agree to a cease fire and a return to our 1941 start lines.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0262.17
They wanted no foreign presence in Japan, no Change of Government and no change of the Military.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0262.18
After the first bomb they still tried to make demands they want 4 things only one of which was the Emperor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0262.19
After 2 bombs and a Soviet declaration of War they agreed to surrender and WE agreed to let them keep their Emperor as a FIGURE head only.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0262.20
The final surrender was UNCONDITIONAL.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0262.21
As evidenced by the Documents the Japanese signed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0262.22
You have yet to provide us with all the supposed surrender attempts by Japan in 1945.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0262.23
You keep making the claim but provide absolutely no evidence of such.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0262.24
There is nothing that can be posted that you would pay attention to unless it appeared to re-affirm your pre-maturely developed position.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0262.25
I've already posted evidence that you flat out ignore but demand more......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0263.1
Targeting civilians or civilian population centers is always unethical; using weapons of mass destruction makes the situation unimaginably worse from a moral standpoint.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0263.2
By 1945, Japan's military had been crippled to the point of ineffectiveness.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0263.3
A bombing campaign against strategic military and industrial targets could have been carried out with minimal casualties among the US military as well as among Japan's civilian population.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0263.4
One of the reasons the sites were chosen was based on creating an atomic barometer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0263.5
They needed to drop the bombs in places that were very much in tact to measure the damage and fall out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0264.4
That is exactly what happened: two atomic bombs and the Soviet invasion ended the war with very little casualties to Americans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0264.5
No atomic bombs, no surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0265.16
You are now engaged in the immorality of stubbornness.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0265.17
Your assertion has flatly been disproved.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0265.18
You can't admit it, which says very poorly about your character.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0266.16
You have made a claim, that Japan offered to Surrender in 1945 NUMEROUS times before either bomb was dropped.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0266.17
PROVE it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0266.18
The ONLY offer they ever made was through the Soviets and that was not a surrender it was a cease fire with a pullback to the 1941 Line for all sides.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0266.19
And according to this offer nothing else would be done to the Japanese.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0266.20
After the first bomb was dropped they made an offer with 4 demands.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0266.21
We rejected it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0266.22
After the second bomb and the Soviet Declaration of War and Invasion Japan's Emperor ordered an immediate surrender with no Conditions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0266.23
The Allies accepted and changed the term to keeping the Emperor as a FIGURE head.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0266.24
Japan surrendered unconditionally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0267.21
This is rock solid proof you ignore facts you don't like because I've linked a government website showing japan offered a conditional surrender but you continue to ignore it.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0267.22
like your twin Starkey.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0268.15
Flatly disproved?

Lol....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0268.17
you have ignored the government link I posted showing Japan's offer of a surrender on one condition and we accepted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0268.18
But you keep on ignoring that..........
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0268.19
hell.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0268.20
you don't even attempt to support your claims like saying all the top military leaders were wrong for saying the bomb was not necessary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0269.14
Your website misinterprets the facts, thus the conclusion is wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0269.15
You would fail any paper you had to turn in on this subject with that interpretation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0269.16
The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that you are intellectually anoxeric, refusing to ingest all the evidence.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0269.17
This is not being persuasive, but demagogic on your part.

You are a LIAR.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0271.15
I provided the minutes from the Japanese Government, I provided the Magic intercepts, they made a surrender offer ONLY after the first bomb.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0271.16
YOU have claimed they made numerous requests including JUST keeping the Emperor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0271.17
PROVE your claim.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0272.7

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0312.10
The US intended to force an Unconditional Surrender.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0313.23
Everyone is laughing at you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0314.6
CurveLight, you are clearly emotionally disturbed and cognitively impaired.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0314.7
The rest of the world is overwhelming in step, and you are out of step.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0314.8
You are wrong, period.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0314.9
Good job on sticking to ad homs when you can't support your claims.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0314.10
You never showed why all the commanders were wrong and your Iraq Melthod is fuxxing stale.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0315.9
The Iraq Method is your idiocy, and the event proved the few commanders who opposed it to be wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0315.10
This discussion proves that your cognition is definitely impaired.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0315.11
So move along, your case is summarily dismissed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0316.9
eots is waiting for you in the conspiracy forums.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.1
Once again you fucking donkey dick sucker......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.2
you said:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.3
"Curvelight has made the claim we never intended to Invade Japan."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.4
So show where I made that claim you lying fuck.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.9
So Curvelight.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.10
Since the US was prepared to invade the home Islands, the Japanese were unwilling to surrender and were training their civilians to human wave attack the landing beaches with bamboo spears, and you never claimed the casualty figures were false.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.11
You would rather have seen several MILLION dead Japanese and upwards of a million casualties on the allied side, rather then drop 2 bombs that killed FAR less people?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.12
And you want us to believe that dropping the bombs was unethical?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.17
You are a coward.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.18
An intellectual coward and an ethical coward.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.19
YOU keep making ignorant claims that are not true and I can link to them through out this thread.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.20
YOU claimed Japan made numerous attempts to surrender before the Bombs were dropped.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.21
AN out right LIE you can not support.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.22
They made one attempt and it was not a surrender but a cessation of Hostilities with Japan relinquishing captured territory after Dec 1941 and the Allies returning Captured Japanese territory.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.23
YOU claimed that Japan made the EXACT same offer to surrender before the bombs were dropped as the one we finally accepted, which was UNCONDITIONAL.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.24
Another bald faced lie.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.25
YOU claimed Japan did not surrender UNCONDITIONALLY, when we all know and have the surrender documents to prove they did EXACTLY that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.26
YOU claimed that the US fabricated casualty estimates for an invasion of Japan.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.27
Implying further that we had no intention of invading and that Japan was already beaten.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0366.28
Another lie.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0367.1
And I disagree.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0367.2
The question is a simple one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0367.3
DO we kill a few hundred thousand in order to save MILLIONS or do we just kill MILLIONS.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0367.4
That is an ethics question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0367.5
You may not LIKE the ethics but it is ethical.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0367.6
Your saying it does not make it so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0367.7
Your question implies you have the right to decide who lives and who dies, you don't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0367.8
The only life you have a right to make that choice about is your own.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0367.9
Absolutely incorrect.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0367.10
Decisions of the most horrific choices are caused by tyrannical governments and leaders that force men and women of good will to make such choices.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0367.11
Please, naivete informs your statement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0367.12
Please think very carefully before uttering such statements.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0367.13
You're full of shit and I've proven several times the bombs were not necessary but you keep on wrapping your ignorance up in a form of patriotism indistinguishable from butt monkey crack.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0368.1
No, it was not unethical.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0369.9
You have not proven anything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0369.10
Once again, you claimed the Japanese made numerous attempts to surrender before the bombs were dropped.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0369.11
A LIE.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0369.12
You claimed that Japan made an offer EXACTLY like what was given them after the bombs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0369.14
You claimed that Japan was offered a conditional surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0369.15
Again a LIE.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0369.16
MEANWHILE, I provided PROOF Japan made ONE attempt to end the war before the bombs were dropped and that was no surrender offer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0369.17
I provided proof that even after both bombs were dropped and the Soviets declared war the Japanese Government REFUSED to surrender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0369.18
It took the DIRECT intervention of the Emperor and that was nearly foiled by an attempted Coup by the Army.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0369.19
Try again you coward.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0371.21
So you can not provide any factual evidence to support your bogus claims?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875443_0371.22
We already knew this, keep on lying it is hilarious.

That's their problem.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.11
It doesn't effect them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.12
It effects the people who want to serve in our military but can't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.13
We did this for African Americans, we did this for women, now it's time to do it for gays.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.14
The military is designed to protect our nation and that is their top priority first and foremost.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.15
If anything gets in the way of that being accomplished, the military seeks to remove it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.16
Having soldiers that are openly gay sparks contention among troops, resulting in lower morale, less teamwork, and overall a lack of professionalism.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.17
There is no discrimination against gays.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.18
They can join the military if they want.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.19
However, they cannot make an issue out of their homosexuality by declaring it to other soldiers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.20
Similarly, any form of sexual misconduct on the parts of heterosexuals is also prohibited and they cannot inquire as to what another soldier's sexuality is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.21
Overall, the military is lean, mean fighting machine, not a Manhattan cocktail party.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.22
Are you suggesting that our military members can't handle working with someone who is openly gay?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.23
I served with a few men and women who were very obviously gay, it didn't bother me or seem to bother others around them at the time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.24
I don't think if they came out and said what everyone already knew things would have changed much.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0008.25
Well, other then them being discharged and all that jazz.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0009.14
how was your military experience affected by DADT?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0009.15
My brother wasn't allowed to serve because he is openly gay.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0009.16
Instead he became a firefighter and almost gave his life on 9/11.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0009.17
Let me see here - if you're good enough to save lives on 9/11 and almost give your life, you're NOT good enough to save lives and give your life for your country?

no, i said i don't support changing the policy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0037.7
i don't oppose changing the policy, either.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0037.8
i prefer to leave military matters to the people who run the military.

Obama cannot revoke the policy alone.

The congress has written it into law, and only the congress can repeal it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0039.13

bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0042.4
go figure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0043.5
In partial answer to your original question, here's <a href="http://talkradionews.com/2008/07/dont-ask-dont-tell-effects-military-cohesiveness/">some testimony by soldiers whose career has been affected by DADT.</a>
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0043.6
Retired Marine Corps. Staff Sgt. and first wounded soldier during the Iraq War Eric Alva, stated that trust was the most important bond he shared with his fellow soldiers, and that when he admitted to them that he was gay, trust and cohesion in the group only strengthened.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0043.7
Joan Darrah, a retired Navy Captain, echoed Alvas sentiments, saying that she was constantly forced to live a double life while serving.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0043.8
After leaving a room in the Pentagon that was destoryed only minutes later on the morning of 9/11, Darrah realized that her partner of 11 years would have been the last to know, had she been killed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0043.9
Due to the policy, she said that she was very secretive about her life as a lesbian, not even listing her partner as an emergency contact.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0043.10
In addition, Darrah said that the Dont Ask Dont Tell policy actually hurts troop cohesion by mandating the immediate removal of soldiers who are found to be gay.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0044.1
del is a good old fashioned biggot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0044.2
as are most conservatives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0044.3
they're insecure closet homophobes who are secretly gay.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8875920_0044.4
a guy i work with would go ballistic if you said that to him....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0022.1
Maybe you're onto something.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0022.2
I was thinking the Marines should absorb the Air Force, but then we don't need you so it would be only an act of charity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0022.3
We could pawn you off on the Navy but they don't need you either.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0022.4
Matter of fact seems everybody can do their own flying AND fighting on the ground but you powderpuffs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0022.5
Probably be best if we divvy up your assets among the 3 useful services and just send y'all home since you couldn't pass a PFT and the sight of an actual bayonet would make you faint.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0022.6
Or perhaps y'all should be re-absorbed back into the Army where you came from.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0022.7

Me, too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0023.6
I hand wash and fold laundry like a demon on steroids, too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0023.7
Hell the NAV even showed me how to hang up my wash on a clothes line with little pieces of rope.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0023.8
Now there's some skills I can take to the bank, eh?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0023.9
I'm like totally qualified to run a pre-industrial laundry service.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0023.10

I've never known an Army guy that even came close.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0025.4

At night when I say my prayers I make sure to include the Iraqis because I know what he's capable of.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0026.5
Don't get all sensitive on me now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0026.6
You know WHO the remark was directed to and why. I grew up in the Air Force.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0026.7
My father is a retired Chief, and my grandfather (his father) a retired Army SgtMaj.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0026.8
I have nothing but respect for the other services.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0026.9
But when it's time to play the interservice rivalry shit-talking game, and it's aimed MY way, I'm returning fire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0027.8
Ooh-rah!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0028.9
Cool logic, just because you never met any so called "hard motherf'ers" in the Army it does not mean they fail to exsist.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0028.10
But of course coming from a family of Marines I will exscuse your bias opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0029.4
Well, we could discuss the Army's judgement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0029.5
Both of my brothers are Army zeroes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0029.6
That's almost like being in the real Army, isn't it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0029.8
One has to wonder just WHAT THE HELL the Army was thinking with THAT dynamic duo; especially, the West Point grad.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0030.6
Do I suspect a bit of sibling jealousy?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0031.3
Well I do suspect that the siblings are a bit jealous of the Gunny being, well, a Gunny.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181118-8876009_0032.6
Yeah, like being a sailor is almost like being a Marine!

Sorry, couldn't resist.

The people are the same as they were in the 14th century as well as back in the 14th century BC.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0004.2
There is some myth that because technology and knowledge has improved we are somehow superior to generations that came before us.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0004.3
That is our pride talking.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0004.4
What we are has been because we've built on the back of their accomplishments.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0004.5
Not because we are somehow superior to them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0004.6
But the people have the same ideas and attitudes as they've always had.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0004.7
human nature hasn't changed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0004.8
The only way it can change is through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0004.9
wtf!?!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0004.11
Non-sequitur much?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0005.1
Yeah I'm hoping for a day in which little town celebrations take place where we throw every crazy religious book in a fire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0005.2
Not all of them, just the 'crazy' ones?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0006.1
On a daily basis thousands of books are pulped and recycled.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0006.2
And some get burnt in municipal incinerators.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0006.3
There is something about burning a book as a act of intellectual destruction that is repellent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0006.4
You buy your own book and burn it...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0006.5
that is your right to be stupid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0006.6
Keep the fires going etc. I have tossed a few books in the trash myself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0006.7
There is just something wrong with making a point of being a jerkass.

If there is anything funny to be taken away from koran burning, fanatical murdering, terrorist appeasing events of the last few weeks, it's that some people seem to view book burning as if it's still the 14th century.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0010.2
I've seen countless people post comments to the effect that book burning stifles free speech, blah blah blah.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0010.3
Newsflash nitwits, not anymore it doesn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0010.4
You see, back in the 14th century, when a book was burned there was a good chance that it was a one-of-a-kind original.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0010.5
Not so today folks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0010.6
To suggest that burning a book today impedes anyone else's ability to get and read there own copy, or stifles free speech in any way, is so silly it's laughable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0010.7
You nitwits know who you are.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0010.9
For every terrorist act committed, burn a koran.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0011.8
'intellectual destruction'?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0011.9

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0011.10
How about a simple political statement?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0011.11
Is that repellent too?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8784904_0012.3
Yeah I guess i'd have to be introduced to one that's not crazy.

Why did Obama wait so long in getting our people out of Egypt?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786197_0001.2
I thought the other day when they were saying "no problem" they were actually evacuating as they spoke.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786197_0001.3
They had to be.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786197_0001.4
Now I hear as things are boiling over they are just thinking about taking a ship over there going through the Suez fror a month long trip?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786197_0001.5
Did anyone tell Obama it's dangerous over there?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786197_0001.6
Tens of thousands of Americans!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786197_0002.1
I have family waiting in the Cairo Airport right now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786197_0002.2
They report that there are no planes coming in or out, and that there are tens of thousands of people at the airport.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786197_0002.3
The NY times reports that we are evacuating - so I called them to see where they got the information - and they said the embassy - as you can imagine - getting through to the American Embassy in Cairo is impossible at this time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786197_0002.4
My family has been told by State Department (today) that there is no evacuation order in place, and that there is nothing we can do but wait.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786197_0002.5
So I really don't think this is even happening.

She flew in yesterday, but said no flights out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786197_0003.4
The airport seems safe.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786197_0003.5
The rioters are pretty focused on the police and the President.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786197_0004.1
Some reports coming out for Americans not to go to the airport but to find their own way via car to other cities or countries if they have the resources.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786197_0004.2
Feeling very bad for them..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0031.1
The Glock dealer was no more a perpetrator than the American Imam.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0031.2
The Glock dealer would not think to open up a store on the site of a mass murder.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0031.3
Nobody would defend the decency of his decision to do that, including me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0031.4
The American Imam, he doesn't have the same decency and respect.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0031.5
Cool.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0031.6
Using that logic, if some Christian goes postal in some small town in America, we'll demolish the church....

If 20 people were killed by a gun, then you have a point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0033.4
To make your analogy similar you would have to have somebody open a place that sells aeroplanes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0033.5
IOW, a mosque had nothing to do with it....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0033.6

It deserves the same reverence, decency, and respect.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0038.5

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0038.6
There are hundreds of mosques in NYC, and several offers of alternate sites.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0038.7
It's not an issue of Constitutional rights, it's an issue of the lack of decency and respect shown by American Imams.

My opinion of it might change if they showed respect to the survivors and families who perished at the WTC.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0067.10
Barring that, they're nothing but self-centered ideologues.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0068.7
So what?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0068.8
That doesn't negate the majority of survivors who don't want it there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0069.9
The quote in the title is hers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0069.10
Opposing the mosque is the thing that she has done.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0069.11
If "crimes begin and end with the criminal who committed them", then why hold an entire religion accountable for the actions of 19 people.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0070.8
Thanks....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0071.10
What is "show respect"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0072.1
Apparently, reopening a Burlington Coat Factory.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0072.2
Because that is what this house of worship and community center will replace.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.1
Seriously, doesn't this hurt?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.2
It's a great argument.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.3
If you don't agree, refute it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.4
The cheap shot doesn't cut it Maddie.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.5
Okay, let me see if I can explain, Missourian.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.6
For the days since the terrible shooting in Arizona, Revere and I have been arguing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.7
I have said the violent rhetoric should be foreclosed, and he has said I am undercutting free speech.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.8
He does not at all agree that an atmosphere of such speech may make such tragedies likely to recur.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.9
"Only the shooter is responsible", he keeps saying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.10
But in the case of the Park 51 Mosque, he seems to do a complete backflip.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.11
Now ALL American Muslims, all mosques, are somehow responsible for 9/11.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.12
Now, a tenuous connection (that only exists if you agree with his beliefs about the role of religion in that tragedy, and I do not) between those who commit a crime and those whose speech MAY support their ideas (and other premise I'm not buying) should be used to foreclose freedom of religion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.13
Consistency is not exactly Revere's hallmark here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.14
He still makes a good point...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.15
one I've made myself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.16
I have as yet to meet a Muslim I didn't like.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.17
And even tho Sunni Man and I often disagree, I like him personally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.18
But I still oppose the GZ Mosque for the exact reason Revere put forward.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.19
Just like I would oppose a Shinto Shrine built at Pearl Harbor during WWII or a Glock outlet opening next to the Safeway in Tuscon next month.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0084.20
When Muslim extremist are no longer plotting to kill us, we can revisit the subject.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0085.7
I'm having trouble with you analogy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0085.8
No one is saying an existing mosque should be demolished.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0085.9
The debate is whether or not a new mosque should be built at that very location.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0085.10
So, I am having trouble understanding how you come up with demolishing the church in Mississippi.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0085.11
Immie
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0085.12
I think in his twisted mind denying the killers the privilege of building a mosque to establish Muslim dominance over Western culture at ground zero is the same as demolishing a mosque that already exists.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0085.13
I guess.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0085.14
It's sick and twisted, but I think that's it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0085.15
Grump is a sad, hateful little bigot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0085.16
I'd like to say he grows on you with time, but except in the sense that a fungus or viral infection grows, it just isn't true.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0085.17
Yep Muslims through their history have a propensity of building MOSQUES on conquered LANDS...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0085.18
Hence the project's FIRST NAME of 'Cordoba'...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0085.19
And the scumbags certainly built a Mosque in Cordoba, Spain after their conquest.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0086.20
You cannot apply vicarious liability to one group and not to another, Missourian.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0086.21
That is why I have said Revere puts himself into a pretzel shape.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0087.14
In what?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0087.15
900 A.D.?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0087.16
I guess you aren't aware of the history of christianity in the UK, or in California?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0088.12
IDIOT...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0088.13
You are unaware totally aren't you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0088.14
Nice try at obfuscation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0088.15
The object of ISLAM is clear.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0088.16
YOU reamain ignorant.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0088.17
Poor little MADDIE...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0088.18
thinks because it's the 21st Century their CONQUEST is gone...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0088.19
*MORON*
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0089.19
What group did Loughner belong to?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0090.14
Wouldn't you expect them to build mosques in their own territories?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0090.15
They controlled Spain for quite awhile back then.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0090.16
I'm sure there were plenty of Christian churches built during and shortly after the various Crusades in what had formally been Muslim territories.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0090.17
The Muslim Community Center in NYC that has been termed the Ground Zero Mosque is not a monument of Muslim victory but rather a place of worship that American Muslims would like to build and according to our own Constitution they have the right to build it if they own the property.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0090.18
I still feel that it would be disrespectful to build on ground zero.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0091.11
He was an American, and evidentially had some interest in politics.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0092.15
One would expect that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0092.16
THEY had a Victory on US SOIL.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0092.17
Why do you think the fervant PUSH to build so close to where they murdered so many?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0092.18
It's a statement by them...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0092.19
as they have done throughout their history.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0093.11
NONE.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0093.12
He was a NUTCASE in his own right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0094.19
Bullshit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0094.20
To say a lone gunman with no particular political views and no backing is the same as the thousands of zealots, fueled by $$ and rhetoric of their imams are the same is juvenile and dangerous.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0094.21
Stop defending terrorism, Madeline.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0094.22
It's not a good thing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0094.23
Even if you do it by pretending it doesn't exist.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0094.24
It does exist, and it's a fucking crime.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0094.25
Islam is a controlled and carefully orchestrated terrorist movement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0094.26
Arizona lunatic acting on his own is not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0094.27
There are no groups of right wingers dancing in the streets waving signs that say "Death to Liberals!"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0094.28
or people stepping forward to support this guy's family.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0094.29
If he dies tomorrow, he won't be considered a martyr; there will be no mother saying "I'm proud of what my son did!"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0094.30
I can't believe you cannot fathom the difference.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0095.1
And PS, this is a perfect example of blood tithing...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0095.2
you insisting that right wingers are as bloody as the Taliban.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0095.3
That IS blood libel, you know.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.12
A victory on US Soil is not in the same league as conquering the U.S.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.13
We have had victories in Iraq and Afghanistan but we have not taken over the land.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.14
One might say that Muslims won a victory on 9/11, but in reality all that happened was that America suffered a terrorist attack.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.15
If a victory is won by simply killing people then you can say they won a victory.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.16
My definition of a victory in war is winning the battle and pushing your enemy out of the territory which was fought for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.17
I do not believe the 9/11 terrorists accomplished that task.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.18
Nor have I seen any proof that those who are associated with the so-called Ground Zero Mosque were in anyway associated with the murderers of 9/11.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.19
You say that this is a statement by them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.20
Maybe that would be the case if they were actually planning on building on the grounds of the World Trade Center.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.21
How far away is far enough?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.22
10 blocks?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.23
20 blocks?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.24
All of Manhattan?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.25
How about all of New York State?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.27
Immie?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.28
It doesn't matter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.29
They brought down the very SYMBOL of Western Capitalist Culture.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.30
The Twin Towers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.31
They at the time almost caused an economic collapse.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.32
To them it was good enough.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.33
WHY was the initial project name of this mosque called 'Cordoba Project'?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0100.35
WHY was it changed later?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0101.1
I know why!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0101.2
Pick me!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0102.22
I know you spoke with passion, Allie, but it is upsetting to read "stop supporting terrorists, Madeline".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0102.23
A false allegation, Allie.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0102.24
Unless you happen to think that freedom of religion = supporting terrorists.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0102.25
You stepped on my feelings a bit there, girl.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0103.1
So if a crime begins and ends with the criminal, according to Palin,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0103.2
does that mean that in the case of a Jew being murdered in medieval times by someone who had heard the stories of Jews killing children for their blood (the blood libel of Palin's speech)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0103.4
that crime ONLY began and ended with the murderer and his act ?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0103.6
that crime didn't begin with the stories concocted to demonize Jews?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0103.8
that crime didn't begin with vitriolic, inflammatory, inciteful rhetoric spread through that society?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0103.9
Really?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0103.10
Did she really intend to refute her own argument in the same speech?????
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0104.2
What are you parsing?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0104.3
What POINT are you trying to relay?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0104.4
You are MIXING events.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0104.5
As to the Mosque genius?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0104.6
The American people have an aversion to allowing the RELIGION of the KILLERS from that day holding SACRED GROUND.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0104.7
Or aren't you that fucking bright and showing your lackluster brillience at being a Statist moron?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0104.8
There's a different sort of blood libel.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0105.7

How dare she barge into a story to defend herself against charges of inspiring murder?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.1
Oh come on Madeline, of all people, YOU should understand this issue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.2
Here's a question for you:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.3
If someone were to propose tearing down Auschwitz or the Holocaust memorial and replacing it with an "earth-friendly German car dealership"....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.4
How would you react?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.5
Come come now...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.6
Be truthful.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.7
Seems to me the proper analogy is how would I feel if someone tore down a Burlington Coat Factory and built a House of Worship?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.8
Why wasn't this land "sacred" before the Muslims wanted to build a new mosque?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.9
How "sacred" is the land next door, which sports a titty bar?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.10
Just as I thought...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.11
You're avoiding the question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.12
I'll ask again, just to watch the next dance you do to avoid it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.15
This analogy involves land that was not deemed "sacred" before WWII, but now is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.16
The analogy is appropriate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0129.17
That is the worst analogy ever.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0130.1
dude, tell me about it,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0130.7
"How dare she barge into a story to defend herself against charges of inspiring murder?"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0130.8
is THAT what she was doing?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0130.9
cus I thought she was using this as a means to DEMONIZE liberals and democrats and show her mindless minions that liberals and democrats are REALLY EVIL and REALLY DESERVE what ever they get...

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0131.19
I am merely showing the illogic and inconsistency in what she said, point by point, fact by fact (and which no one is so far disputing, so what I'm saying is apparently indisputable).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0131.20
What's wrong, exactly, with what I'm doing?

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0142.12

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0142.15
you're doin' it right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.1
Palin said, specifically that journalists and pundits were
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.2
"manufacturing a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they purport to condemn."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.3
She is thus stating, unequivocally, her opinion that journalists/pundits CAN in fact incite violence with their words.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.4
But she also says:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.5
Acts of monstrous criminality stand on their own.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.6
They begin and end with the criminals who commit them, not collectively with all the citizens of a state, not with those who listen to talk radio, not with maps of swing districts used by both sides of the aisle
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.8
thus contradicting what she said above that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.9
In short, she doesn't have a clue what she's talking about.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.10
I am not defending her.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.11
I have not read what she said beyond this site nor do I care what she said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.12
However, the way I see it is that by blaming the pundits i.e. "hate speech", rather than Jared Lee Loughner, we are taking away the focus on what it should be and that is that Mr. Loughner committed murder and quite frankly I believe he was mentally disturbed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.13
If any blame should be placed on anyone's shoulders besides Jared Lee Loughner's it should be placed on the shoulders of the people and places that refused to help a man who needed help mentally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.14
I do not believe that anyone can successfully argue that this man was not mentally disturbed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.15
Blaming politicians, pundits and internet speech is not the answer here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.16
The focus should not be upon us being more civil to each other (although it would be nice if we were) but rather on what caused Jared Lee Loughner to snap last Saturday.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0143.17

That's why I'm talking about this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0185.1
But she also says:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0185.18
I do not think anyone is doing it deliberately or even saying so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0185.19
I think that when we point fingers at everyone else we are exonerating him...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0185.20
basically it is the unintentional consequences of casting blame on everyone else.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0185.21
That is how I see what is happening, anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0186.1
If crimes "begin and end with the criminals who commit them,"....

The mosque isn't on the sacred site of a mass murder.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0190.8
It's located at the formerly sacred Burlington House of Coats
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0190.9
As well as being as close to ground zero as they could get, correct.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0191.7
The mosque is located at the hallowed ground that used be known as The Burlington Coat Factory, just a few doors down from the sacred Pussycat Lounge
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0191.8
I've worshiped at both locations.

I think your confused the Pussycat Lounge had woman dancing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0192.6
I guess the families of the Muslim victims who wanted the mosque to be built arent legitimate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0192.7
In wingnuts mind, they probably helped plan the attack that killed their loved one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0192.9
Of course they helped, do you believe that the Moslems who started this war were alone.

By 1941, annual festivals were being celebrated for all three shrines; Kotohira Jinsha, Shirasaki Hachimangu and Otaki Jinja, with an ever-growing membership of over 1,200 families.

In the worst abuse of government authority in the history of the U.S., more than 120,000 Japanese Americans were interned in relocation camps.

Issei leaders of the community in Hawaii were immediately rounded up and sent to internment camps on Sand Island, Honouliuli, Maui, Kaui, Lanai, Molokai, the Big Island and the Mainland.

All religious and cultural activities were terminated as the war continued.

In 1943, the interned Rev. Isobe was deported to Japan, forcing officers to call a special meeting on July 21, 1945 to decide the fate of the shrine.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0194.21
Kotohira Jinsha officially announced the temporary closure of the shrine and its activities on April 6, 1946.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0194.22
After the war, members enthusiastically restored shrine activities on December 31, 1947, despite the absence of a priest.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0194.23
However, the shrine faced another crisis on June 8, 1948, when its property was seized by the Federal Government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0194.24
An emergency meeting was called and a special committee formed to initiate measures for the return of the shrine and its property.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0194.25
On March 4, 1949, an announcement for the sale of the Kotohira Jinsha property appeared on local newspapers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0194.26
The shrine immediately solicited the services of the law firm, Robertson, Castle & Anthony and filed a suit on April 4, 1949 against Attorney General Tom C. Clark, the State of Hawaii and the Federal Alien Land Office.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0194.27

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0246.16
You obviously missed the point of the OP.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0246.17
For the record (and those slow on the uptake), I am not comparing American political rhetoric to anything that comes out of OBL's mouth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0246.18
So I agree with your last sentence.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0246.19
The point is this: Sarah Palin made a stink about the Mosque that is two blocks away from Ground Zero due to the fact that it was close to (as we all know) the site of the twin towers that were destroyed by fanatical muslim terrorists.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0246.20
The people behind the Mosque had nothing to do with the 9-11 attack.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0246.21
However, they were held accountable for it all the same.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0246.22
Then, a year or so later, some crazy asshole in Arizona shoots up a bunch of people, to include a 9 year old girl and a congresswoman, and the left wing punditry (erroneously) claims Palin is inciting these events with her "vitriol" and shares some blame over the event.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0246.23
Palin get's all high and fucking mighty and makes the statement: "Crimes begin and end with the people who commit them".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0246.24
See the hypocrisy?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0246.25
OK, thanks for the explanation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0246.26
However, I believe I've found the disconnect and bolded it above.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0246.27
I do not recall anyone suggesting that those behind the ground zero mosque were to be held accountable for 9/11.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0246.28
If there were, my guess is it was a tiny tiny fringe minority.

But by all means, provide some links and prove me wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0246.30
I'd be much obliged if you can.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0247.27
There have been plenty of posts in this thread, with links, that argue that the people behind the mosque should be held accountable for 9/11.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0250.27
If they aren't being held accountable, then why would anyone give a damn if they build a mosque within a two block radius of Ground Zero?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0251.24
Personally, I didnt' give a crap about the mosque.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0251.25
But I can understand how some might have found it insensitive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0251.26
But I don't see how finding it insensitive constitutes holding those behind it accountable for 9/11.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0252.24
They are accountable for their own actions, and when those actions either by design OR by consequence aid or abbet an enemy in war they are accountable for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0252.25
The only question would be whether or not it's by design or consequence as in the former they could be held criminally responsible for treason and in the latter civily responsable for whatever damages are incurred from their negligence (which may also be criminal).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0252.26
Unless of course you are of the legal opinion that a person is NOT responsible for unintended malconsequence resulting from their actions (and in some cases innaction), which would be wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0253.11
How is it insensitive if the mosque has nothing to do with the 9/11 terrorists?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0254.7
Good one!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0255.8
I see another wingnut is too scared to defend his own words
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0255.9
Why do wingnuts always run when challenged?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0256.6
As far as I can tell it would mean that people who had nothing to do with 9/11 were doing a victory dance for something that they had nothing to do with.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0257.7
Oh, I'm sorry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0257.8
I didn't realize you were being serious.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0257.9
I did in fact laugh out loud when I read your post.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0257.10
The answer seems obvious to me, but let me give you an analogy that might help you out...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0257.11
How would it be insensitive for me to call a black man a nigger if I had nothing to do with slavery?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0257.12
Suss that out and maybe you'll get it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0258.6
Yup.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0258.7
And I agree that it's a pretty silly accusation, but believing this and also believing that crime begins and ends with those who commit them is not contradictory or hypocritical, as the OP implies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0259.2
Good one!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0259.12
Last time I went by the area, the mosque wasn't calling black people "nigger".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0259.13
Please explain how it is insensitive to build a mosque on the former site of the Sacred Burlington Coat Factory
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0260.11
I can't explain why something that doesn't offend me is offensive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0260.12
But neither you nor I get to tell other people what they are allowed to find offensive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0260.13
Again, the point I'm trying to make is that being offended by the mosque and also believing crime begins and ends with the criminals who commit them is not contradictory or hypocritical, no matter how much you and geaux want to pretend that it is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0261.12
Gee, earlier you said that building the mosque is insensitive and that the reason was obvious and simple.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0261.13
Now, it's suddenly impossible for you to explain why it's insensitive
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0261.15
Keep dancing
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0262.11
Those responsible for 9/11 were Muslim
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0262.12
Those who want to build a mosque are Muslim
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0262.13
Some view this as insensitive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0262.14
That much seems obvious, you hacktard.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0262.15
It's the WHY that I can't explain.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786509_0262.16
But you've clearly demonstrated that you are incapable of objectivity and it's been duly noted.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786987_0034.10
The numbers just don't seem to be adding up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786987_0034.11
And is 'Shop till you Drop' really the right message to be sending Americans at this point?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786987_0034.12
Just something i've been wondering about.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786987_0034.13
All this suffering yet the people still shop till they drop?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786987_0034.14
Hmm?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786987_0034.16
So...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786987_0034.17

The National Retail Federation predicts spending this holiday season will reach $451.5 billion, up 3.3 percent over last year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786987_0035.2
That would be the biggest increase since 2006, and the largest total since a record $452.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786987_0035.3
8 billion in 2007.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786987_0035.4
The holiday season runs from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, so a strong week after Christmas could still make this the biggest of all time.

I don't think 'Shop till you Drop' proves your assertion.

Your 'Blame the Evil Christians" theory on over-spending is just plain simple.

Seriously,i lost a whole lot of respect for you with that ridiculous theory.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786987_0038.9
Your knowledge of what being a Christian is about is very limited at best.

You obviously know nothing about Christians.

I pretty much support the food bank at my local church, and when I die they insist on having my funeral there although I tried to talk them out of it and they know I am a non believer.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786987_0038.27
Your 'Blame the Evil Christians" theory on over-spending is still just silly Bullshit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786987_0038.28
Seriously,you need to grow up and stop being so simple.

I don't care what your past experiences with Christianity were.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8786987_0038.30
That doesn't mean you know anything about Christians.

Try actually talking to some Christians and maybe even attending Church once and awhile.

But you really need to get over your pettiness and bitterness.

The recent discovery of two "Toner Cartorage Bombs" seemed like a great find and the world would be safer from the efforts of the authorities.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.2
Then...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.3
came the report that the woman reported involved was released after a few hours and the reason was that she had been the victim of identity theft.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.4
WTF???
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.5
Does anyone else find that astonishing?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.6
How did they find the bombs in the first place if the person linked to sending them was a fake?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.7
This just doesn't add up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.8
Did the actual bombers turn themselves in or inform on themselves.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.9
This would be an Al Quida first.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.10
Have they ever started a terror plot and not tried to carry it through ending in just a warning?

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.12
Does anyone else find this to be a little much to believe?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.13
Let's not go conspiracy here..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.14
but there are certainly huge holes in what has been told the public.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.15
This assumes that the government IS telling us the whole story, which, of course, they are not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.16
Too many people assume that once they watch 10 min of CNN they have the entire story, as well as all the background information.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.17
This has nothing to do with conspiracy, and everything to do with the fact that the goverment has to keep some infromation from the press due to 1) possible intelligence advantages and 2) making the information part of a legal case.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.18
Yes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.19
I agree that there has to be a reasonable amount of secrecy in a case like this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.20
I'm not suggesting any conspiracy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.21
I just found it odd that the persons of interest who's identities were used to mail the bombs were cut loose so quickly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.22
Like I said in the OP it seems to exclude the possibility that the authorities nailed the plot by nipping it at the bud...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0006.23
since the "Bud" was just a stolen name and address.

Allowing the U.S. military's Special Operations Command units to operate under the CIA would give the U.S. greater leeway to strike at militants even without the explicit blessing of the Yemeni government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0010.2
In addition to streamlining the launching of strikes, it would provide deniability to the Yemeni government because the CIA operations would be covert.

The White House is already considering adding armed CIA drones to the arsenal against militants in Yemen, mirroring the agency's Pakistan campaign.

They found the bomb BEFORE they found the woman.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0011.13
When they found the bomb, they first thing to do was to track it back to who sent it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0011.14
That led them to the woman.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0011.15
She (presumably) showed that her identity was stolen, so (presumably) they are looking into the ID theft.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787574_0011.16
Presumably, they are concerned that the person who did give the package to the recieving clerk was involved (duh)

There doesn't seem to be any novel con law question presented on these facts and it's a puzzler why the SCOTUS took the cert.

Have you read the 4th Circuit opinion and the transcript of yesterday's questioning?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0013.4
It seems the Court is looking at whether the 4th Circuit was correct in disregarding the public v. private nature of the individuals and event and focusing on the type of speech instead.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0013.5
There's also a side issue of amicus waivers.

The attorney for the church is the daughter of the nut case pastor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0013.8
The public v. private nature is THE argument for the church as the ruling in the Jerry Fallwell v. Hustler case is what they are hanging their entire argument on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0013.9
How they can claim the father of the soldier is a public figure is absurd.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0013.10
That is the entire case.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0013.11
The father IS NOT a public figure and is a private citizen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0013.12
The jury verdict must stand.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0013.13
Actually what they're arguing if you read it closely is that Hustler should be expanded to private individuals, or conversely that the definition of public figure should be changed to include anyone who has personal information available publicly - in this case, through the deceased's obituary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0013.14
Why they dropped the sufficient evidence objection and it had to be raised on amicus is beyond me, that's the key to the entire case.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0013.15
The WBC people were never suspected to be all that bright though.

The WBC assholes were kept a few hundred yards away, they got to wave their little signs and the family never even knew they were there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.4
I can see mebbe clarifying when someone becomes a "public figure" for purposes of libel and slander law -- but even that is a stretch, as I am not persuaded anything the WBC wrote on its signs or shouted at passers by could be legally regarded as libelous.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.5
Beyond that, I am not convinced the SCOTUS can find anything new to say about the First Amendment on these facts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.6
"Harrassment" is a matter of criminalizing conduct, not speech.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.7
I doubt the Synder family could have filed a police report on the WBC for any harrassment type crime in connection with their son's funeral.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.8
How can a reasonable person be "put in fear, etc." by a protest they were not aware of until the paper reported on it the next day?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.9
Actually if you read the decision the Snyders were awarded $2.9 million (reduced to $2.1million) not because of the newspaper coverage, but because Mr. Snyder sought out and watched the WBC's "documentary" video of the protest on their website.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.10
True story.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.12
The 4th Circuit used Milkovich as their primary case with Cantwell quoted as the secondary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.13
But what they actually overturned the District on was sending the question of law as to whether the speech should have First Amendment protection to the jury rather than deciding it from the bench - which is what they did by focusing on type of speech rather than nature of speaker and audience and concluded it was protected.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.14
The only problem may be that they used New York Times in their tort analysis after saying public v. private didn't matter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.15
The concurrence at the Circuit level also raises the (valid, IMO) point of lack of sufficient evidence to prove harm but on an amicus waiver, over which there seems to be some confusion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.16
That's an interesting side issue that may be addressed.

Excellent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.22
The court must take into consideration the technology of the times in their ruling.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.23
I just had a case where a youth committed suicide and the bullies posted more negative crap about this kid on the web site dedicated to a memorial for the youth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.24
The parents of the youth would go on the web site to see all the kind remarks about their child and then see the negative crap also.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0015.25
Usually free speech cases like these take a long time to rule on and do not have split decisions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0016.21
That's just crazy talk!

Of course they are because without the "expansion" they have no argument.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0017.17
However, they argued yesterday that TV interviews the father gave "expanded" the father to a piblic figure from a private one de facto.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0018.23
The problem I have here is that the WBC's site isn't a memorial site for Matthew Snyder, it is their own property to disseminate their point of view.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0018.24
By the time Mr. Snyder did his google search he knew from media sources WBC had been present, but he chose voluntarily to view it anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0018.25
IIED is a very narrow and hard to win tort for a reason, you don't want to open the door to multi million dollar judgments for anyone who says something that hurts a person's feelings, whether directed at them or not, whether made in their presence or not, whether intent to harm that individual is real or whether it is a promotional piece for their movement and the intent to harm is simply imputed because the offended party went out of his way to find it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0018.26
If this were any group other than WBC, would you feel the same way?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0018.27
Think about that, because whatever ruling comes down will affect all religious, quasi-political and groups out there as far as whether they can picket, protest, or use any material on their website or in their publications naming groups or individuals or that could be considered offensive to named groups or individuals.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0018.28
It's the voluntary and knowing nature of Mr. Snyder's exposure that bugs me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0018.29
I just don't feel comfortable with expanding IIED that far, WBC assholes or no.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0019.14
I am surprised the ACLU is not representing the WBC. Doubtless they'll file an amicus brief.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0019.15
If the parties' lawyers have fucked up the law and the facts, this is one more reason why SCOTUS normally would not grant cert.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.1
There has to be a present risk of harm, editec.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.2
Reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on first amendment rights are constitutional, but only if they pass muster on this point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.3
<a href="http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/771/771.F2d.920.82-1913.82-1865.html">771 F.2d 920</a>
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.4
And those already existing time place and manner restrictions were utilized at Matthew Snyder's funeral, with the result that the family never even knew WBC was there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.5
So why do we need broad new restrictions on speech, or liability expanded for speech, when existing restrictions already work ?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.6
Apparently the restrictions did not work as harm was done.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.7
It was proven in a lower court by a judge.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.8
Granted that was overruled in a higher court, that is how we got here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.9
I highly doubt the Supreme Court took this case, only to agree with the appeals decision.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.10
A narrow ruling with a ban on political speech focused on a private individual without a political opinion on the speech in question does no harm.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.11
In this case, the soldier was the private individual and could not speak in his own defense.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.12
I think something about private events that have no reasonable expectation of being completely out of the public might be part of it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.13
I'm not so sure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.14
To my knowledge IIED hasn't been expanded anywhere to cover knowing and voluntary viewing of offensive material in the media or online, but with all the tort cases out there it's hard to say for sure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.15
I'm uncomfortable with it though, for a lot of reasons.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.16
The example of defacing a memorial site that Gadawg brought up is one thing, that's essentially vandalism of another person's property and the parents would be viewing it unawares.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0031.17
But what about when the "victim" voluntarily seeks out a site knowing in advance the content will be offensive and then claims millions because he was in fact offended?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0032.13
There are a couple other problems with this argument.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0032.14
The first is the sufficiency of the evidence, which was considered so vital on appeal it caused a split in the bench not over whether the evidence was sufficient but whether they could rule it was insufficient on an amicus waiver (read the 4th Circuit ruling).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0032.15
The second being that the question of whether the speech was protected, a question of law, was given to the jury - which is only to determine questions of fact.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0032.16
The judge is to hear arguments and determine all questions of law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0032.17
That alone pretty much guarantees this will be remanded for either summary judgment or retrial - under what instructions is what remains to be seen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0033.1
The court has both liberal and conservative points to make.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0033.2
The opinions will be interesting.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0033.3
The church is going to lose.

stay tuned.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0036.25
Well said but I trust the jury verdict.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0036.26
They are the voice and interpreters of this tort and did their duty.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0036.27
This is about a family and their grief first and religion, or lack of it as WBC clearly shows, plays no part in it for me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0037.1
Calling for people to commit crimes against a group is hate speech.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0037.2
Basically it's a kind of incitment to riot and it ought to be illegal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0037.6
By statute as you indicated.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0037.7
Excellent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0037.8
Very good thread here sports fans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0039.11
The only problem with trusting the jury on this one is that they were given a question of law to determine.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0039.12
It was left up to them to decide whether the First Amendment applied.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0039.13
No jury should be deciding questions of law, those are to be decided by the judge prior to giving the case to the jury to determine the questions of fact.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0039.14
So if the jury was in fact instructed incorrectly, chances are they will not come to the correct conclusion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0039.15
The Jury Instruction given on this clearly put the question of First Amendment protection in their laps.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0039.16
I still think for this reason alone it will be remanded for a new trial with instructions no matter what the outcome, unless WBC wins outright (probably not) in which case it will be remanded for summary judgment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0039.17
There wasn't a jury verdict based on the proper findings from the proper source.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0039.18
Nor should the jury be interpreting the nature and scope of the tort - again, that is a question of law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0039.19
The jury is to be instructed as to the law to be applied to the facts they determine, not the other way around.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0039.20
Determining the law and instructing the jury in that law is what the judge is for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0039.21
Respectfully, I have investigated over 1000 cases for trial in 30 years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0039.22
The jury is charged on the law and in this case material fact was the free speech 1st Amendment protection.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0039.23
That is a jury decision as to the facts: · State v. Howell "The jury must beleft perfectly free in reaching a conclusion upon the testimony introduced, untrammeled by any intimidation from the judge as to whether a certain fact at issue has been proved or not" · Concerning the 1st Amendment Constitutional argument and jury charges by a judge: · Norris v. Clinkscales "A judge violates this provision when he expresses in his charge his own opinion upon the force and effect of the testimony, or any part of it, or intimates his views of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence, in whole or in part.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0039.24
Under the Constitution the force and effect, or weight and sufficiency, of testimony and facts must be left exclusively to the jury, uninfluenced by any expression or intimation of opinion on The First Amendment or any other Amendment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0040.13
The whole family are lawyers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.5
Right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.6
The jury has full power over questions of fact, of evidence and testimony, weight and credibility.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.7
The judge can't influence them in any way over that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.8
This is different from questions of law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.9
For example, the jury doesn't decide whether an objection is sustained or overruled.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.10
They don't decide what evidence is admissible.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.11
They don't decide what the law says, they are told what it says and they are to determine the facts exactly as you have described and apply those to the law as they are instructed by the judge in order to reach a conclusion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.12
What types of speech are covered by the First Amendment is not a question of fact for a jury to determine.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.13
It's settled law that is to be determined by the judge and then the jury instructed as to what speech is and is not protected and under what circumstances.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.14
They then go over all the facts, evidence and testimony and decide whether those facts as they determine them fit the law as they were instructed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.15
We are on the same page.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.16
I know the rules of evidence.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.17
You fail to understand they were already PAST that when this went totrial.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.18
The jury was charged on the law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.19
What IS free speech is a judicial decision and that is where they are now,only after appeal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.20
But the Constitution, where the 1st Amendment is, does not allow judcial interpretation AT TRIAL on issues of material facts IN evidence.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.21
That is a jury issue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.22
Did you read Jury Instruction 21 in the 4th Circuit opinion?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.23
If not you should.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.24
To paraphrase (there's a link in one of my earlier posts on page 2, I think) the jury was simply told the level of protection varies on the type of speech, with no instruction on what the levels are or what types do and do not receive protection.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.25
And yet the level of protection for different types of speech is a matter of law, not fact.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.26
So the jury was in fact given a question of law to determine - the judge did not spell out the law but left it up to the jury to decide what is and is not protected speech.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0043.27
See the problem here?

There are better ways to speak your mind than to scream like banshees at ordinary people going about their private business.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0045.7
The case before the court would not allow that sort of finding from the facts, because the family never saw, or heard, Phelps and his church.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0045.8
I would think that harassment has to be immediate before it is actionable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0046.1
They heard it after the fact Quantum.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0046.2
Harm seems to have been established in the lower courts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0046.3
I think drawing a bystander into a political speech for your benefit and the other private party's harm is the key here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0047.13
I think you have that backward.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0047.14
Snyder is the one pinning his whole case on the public/private division, and the news about that funeral was very public.

WBC is getting sued by a grieving parent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0048.2
What the fuck law or act (of Congress or of a state) is even implicated?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0048.3
Freedom of speech has never been understood to restrict the ability of people to sue other people for things like libel and slander.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0048.4
It cannot be properly understood in that way, in fact.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0048.5
Only the so-called "1st Amendment 'absolutists'" think in such ridiculous terms.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0048.6
So if a citizen can sue another citizen over something said or written, then why can't a citizen sue another citizen for the intentional infliction of emotional injury caused by the outrageous CONDUCT of the party getting sued?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0048.7
If the plaintiff succeeds in the lawsuit at the SCOTUS level, there will have been ZERO violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0048.8
The fucking scumbags of WBC will merely have had their depraved, disgusting and outrageous behavior properly called into account.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0048.9

How much free speech will anyone have if someone can sue anytime they are offended?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0049.1
I like how free speech rights all point to protecting objectionable speech.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0049.2
Free Speech was meant to protect a political minority from the majority in getting their message heard.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0049.3
It was not meant to protect pornographers, hate speech against a minority or politically motivated attacks on a small group of private citizens, who are not even part of that discussion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0049.4
Some speech is simply unnecessary to the ends of a political debate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0049.5
I expect that the ruling will fall on the time tested principle of liberty up to the point it displaces the liberty of another.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0049.6
So, if I print up a political track that talks about sex in a graphic manner, that is fine, but if I leave politics out, is isn't?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0049.7
How exactly is that supposed to work?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0050.16
They can't sue just because they are offended and that was not the basis here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0051.4
Harm from deliberately seeking out offensive material.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0051.5
that is like me going in the store and asking for a Hustler, and then demanding my money back because it contained pornography.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0051.6
I don't think that will fly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0052.1
The point was, free speech many times IS protecting something that is objectionable for no other reason than that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0052.2
I fail to see how political discourse is harmed in its true form by dropping the pretense that objectionable stuff can protect the other.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0053.17
Slander is action against against an offensive statement that claims to be true.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0053.18
The statement that God killed Mathew Snyder because he hates fags, and demonstrates that hatred by killing US soldiers who defend fags, is extremely hateful, and demonstratively offensive, but I doubt it meets the legal definition of slander.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0053.19
The jury had the chance to hit back at a bunch of despicable people for a horrific belief, but those beliefs, and their right to express them, is a fundamental right in this country.

the whole controversy over pornography is a perfect example of this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0075.13
When the court ruled that pornography was anything that did not have socially redeeming qualities the result was far from what all the people who set out to protect us from ourselves wanted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787903_0075.14
Instead of eliminating an entire industry, we ended up with an era of porn that included a short disclaimer about the social perils of promiscuous sex, and the exact same movie we would have seen before the ruling.

Perhaps because we understand that two wrongs (or three) don't make a single right.

I think the delay was caused by the EPA.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0034.2
The skimmer works by skimming oil and water, filtering the oil and discharging the water back into the sea.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0034.3
The EPA's concern was the amount of oil contained in water being pumped back into the sea.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0034.4

Lawrence Solomon, Financial Post · Saturday, Jun. 26, 2010
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0042.4
Some are attuned to the possibility of looming catastrophe and know how to head it off.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0042.5
Others are unprepared for risk and even unable to get their priorities straight when risk turns to reality.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0042.6
The Dutch fall into the first group.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0042.7
Three days after the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico began on April 20, the Netherlands offered the U.S. government ships equipped to handle a major spill, one much larger than the BP spill that then appeared to be underway.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0042.8
"Our system can handle 400 cubic metres per hour," Weird Koops, the chairman of Spill Response Group Holland, told Radio Netherlands Worldwide, giving each Dutch ship more cleanup capacity than all the ships that the U.S. was then employing in the Gulf to combat the spill...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0042.10
Why does neither the U.S. government nor U.S. energy companies have on hand the cleanup technology available in Europe?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0042.11
Ironically, the superior European technology runs afoul of U.S. environmental rules.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0042.12
The voracious Dutch vessels, for example, continuously suck up vast quantities of oily water, extract most of the oil and then spit overboard vast quantities of nearly oil-free water.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0042.13
Nearly oil-free isn't good enough for the U.S. regulators, who have a standard of 15 parts per million -- if water isn't at least 99.9985% pure, it may not be returned to the Gulf of Mexico.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0042.14
When ships in U.S. waters take in oil-contaminated water, they are forced to store it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0042.15
As U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen, the official in charge of the clean-up operation, explained in a press briefing on June 11, "We have skimmed, to date, about 18 million gallons of oily water--the oil has to be decanted from that [and] our yield is usually somewhere around 10% or 15% on that."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0042.16
In other words, U.S. ships have mostly been removing water from the Gulf, requiring them to make up to 10 times as many trips to storage facilities where they off-load their oil-water mixture, an approach Koops calls "crazy."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0043.1
And yet, Dutch ships are there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0043.2
And Norway's ships are as well and they've been there since the rig blew up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0043.3

NEW ORLEANS  BP and the Obama administration face mounting complaints that they are ignoring foreign offers of equipment and making little use of the fishing boats and volunteers available to help clean up what may now be the biggest spill ever in the Gulf of Mexico.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0044.7
The Coast Guard said there have been 107 offers of help from 44 nations, ranging from technical advice to skimmer boats and booms.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0044.8
But many of those offers are weeks old, and only a small number have been accepted, with the vast majority still under review, according to a list kept by the State Department.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0044.9
And in recent days and weeks, for reasons BP has never explained, many fishing boats hired for the cleanup have done a lot of waiting around.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0044.10
A report prepared by investigators with the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., detailed one case in which the Dutch government offered April 30 to provide four oil skimmers that collectively could process more than 6 million gallons of oily water a day.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0044.11
It took seven weeks for the U.S. to approve the offer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0044.12
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Thursday scorned the idea that "somehow it took the command 70 days to accept international help."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0044.13
"That is a myth," he declared, "that has been debunked literally hundreds of times."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0044.14
He said 24 foreign vessels were operating in the Gulf before this week.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0044.15
He did not specifically address the Dutch vessels.

Prior to the dutch ships arriving, they sent the sweeper arms to be used on US ships.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0046.2
And again, Norway has six or seven skimmers in the Gulf.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0046.3

From the article I posted, you allude to:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0047.8
In sharp contrast to Dutch preparedness before the fact and the Dutch instinct to dive into action once an emergency becomes apparent, witness the American reaction to the Dutch offer of help.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0047.9
The U.S. government responded with "Thanks but no thanks," remarked Visser, despite BP's desire to bring in the Dutch equipment and despite the no-lose nature of the Dutch offer --the Dutch government offered the use of its equipment at no charge.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0047.10
Even after the U.S. refused, the Dutch kept their vessels on standby, hoping the Americans would come round.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0047.11
By May 5, the U.S. had not come round.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789373_0047.12
To the contrary, the U.S. had also turned down offers of help from 12 other governments, most of them with superior expertise and equipment --unlike the U.S., Europe has robust fleets of Oil Spill Response Vessels that sail circles around their make-shift U.S. counterparts.

And didn't you say that the taxpayers were going to have to foot the bill anyway?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0061.3
Exactly!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0062.9
boycott....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0062.10
no...

calling for the death of the CEO....

YES!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0062.13
The taxpayers are already footing a portion of the bill!!!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0062.14
It's called the US Coast Guard and the US Navy being on scene and providing support...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0062.15
do you want them to do the entire clean up now?

On topic: Anyone who thinks that BP should be boycotted has an IQ smaller than their shoe size.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0064.21
Off Topic: The old adage 'with age comes wisdom' is definitely not accurate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0064.22
Fuck you, you stupid blind bitch.

Geology and geography weren't strongly emphasized in your schooling were they?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0065.4
Whats a spree, how do you clean them once you've killed one, and are they better roasted, boiled, or pan fried?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0066.16
Even if no Guardsmen or sailors are killed or injured in the clean up, those men and women are directly exposed to the oil...

not just on the water, but air-bourne as the wind whips up the froath.

They can wear all the protective gear available but it is inevitable that they will still have some severely injuried -- injuries that will manifest in a decade or so as cancer and other diseases.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0066.19
God bless the clean up workers.

Do you use 76 stations?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0069.17
How about Exxon stations?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0069.18
Please tell us where you get your gas.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0078.6
Yes I do Luissa, though I dun think I own anything made by Rubbermaid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0078.7
I am sure BP is a conglomerate and supplier to many companies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0078.8
Boycotting is never perfect, Luissa...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0078.9
do you have a better idea?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0078.10
Siting passively by whilst manatees and sea turtles become extinct in the next month does not appeal to me, but I am more interested in being effective than I am in being right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0078.11
What ought we do then miss, in your opinion?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0078.12
Thats the first step in every evil deed....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0078.13
you stop thinking about whether or not your cause is right, and then whatever you want to do you can justify in your mind...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.17
Vengeance?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.18
Isn't that the kind of thing a liberal should be against?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.19
Vengeance brings more vengeance remember?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.20
Funny how those oh so self-righteous liberal sensibilities go out the window when its convenient...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.21
Well if its vengeance you seek, take it out on your lifestyle..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.22
After all if you follow the trail back to its source, and get to the core of the entire evil you will find consumerism and modern lifestyles the prime culprit...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.23
If there wasn't an ever increasing need for oil, we wouldn't be drilling there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.24
If there really was a viable alternative oil wouldn't be an issue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.25
BP nor the owners of the rig wanted a disaster like this, it hurts them publicly, in a very hard and very hard to get past way.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.26
not to mention the sheer costs and legalities to follow.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.27
Also loss of property, loss of revenue from the oil, and various other things.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.28
They did not take shortcuts or skirt any regulations in place, they were just inspected recently and passed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.29
This was an accident.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.30
A very tragic and unfortunate accident and nothing more.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.31
They will pay for the clean-up and damages, in fact who do you think will be the main employer of those doing the cleaning?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.32
BP will of course just as EXXON did before.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.34
Really?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.35
Then look to your car, your house, your boat, your electricity, your medicine, your consumables, your food, your water, and even your very existence.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.36
Perhaps.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.37
I think it will take time to analyse what exactly went wrong on the rig...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.38
but it really does not matter, legally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.39
The BP Corp. is Strictly Liable for the spill and all its consequences.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.40
I am not a "Greenie".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.41
I can throw a plastic container into the trash without weeping.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.42
But I protested against the Alaskan Oil Pipeline, I have agitated for/against EPA activities, and I do care about the State of Florida because I lived and loved there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.43
How innocent of bio-impact must I be before I am ethically able to condemn BP?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.44
And where on Earth did you ever get the idea that all Liberals are sweetie-pies who cannot get angry?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0079.45
Miss the 1960's entirely did ya?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.30
Nice response!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.31
Seriously you got me on the 60's remark.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.34
I concede that to you...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.35
However, I do feel for the desire to lash out, I cannot stress enough how this is not the way to effect real change....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.36
All this WILL do is push a bill and legislation through that is not designed nor intended to save any environment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.37
Cap and trade is about CO2 and CO2 only, it will not address anything such as this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.38
And whats more giving an opportunity for greedy business men to make the make money off the product AND the effects of using it is the work of insanity in regards to reduction.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.39
I do know BP will pay dearly, as will the owners of the rig, and rightly so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.40
And that in reality is all we can hope to get out of this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.41
There can never be enough legislation to counter every possible thing that can happen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.42
Only thing it does is generate revenue for politicians and government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.43
And whats worse the most of that revenue will go to feeding the infrastructure whose job it is to regulate those new regulations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.44
We get a law requiring a new switch or cut-off valve, and what would it change?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.45
Well the fact is it wouldn't change anything in regards to this spill or any like it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.46
The explosion was beneath where any such switch would have been.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.47
And since we cannot regulate natural disasters, or every possible accident imaginable, the legislation is a waste....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.48
Sure it may stop some kinds of accidents which haven't occurred yet to my knowledge, but it will not stop this type of accident..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.49
I am very sorry for the damage to the environment, but new legislation will only feed itself and not change anything...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.50
Regulations don't mattert if those in chgarge of enforcing the regulations reoutinely issue exemptions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.51
BP has lobbied the White House Council on Environmental Quality -- which provides NEPA guidance for all federal agencies-- to provide categorical exemptions more often.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.52
In an April 9 letter, BP America's senior federal affairs director, Margaret D. Laney, wrote to the council that such exemptions should be used in situations where environmental damage is likely to be "minimal or non-existent."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0093.53
An expansion in these waivers would help "avoid unnecessary paperwork and time delays," she added.

Well, alright, calling for the death of the CEO is a bit extreme.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0094.9
I'll give you that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0094.10
Though if deaths occur from this, like say from cancer from the pollutants, that would be murder by negligence, wouldn't it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0094.11
As far as the other part goes, I want BP to pay for this anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0094.12
Personally I don't care if they go bankrupt from legal fees.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0110.18
So what should we do with the Obama Administration since they accepted the campaign contributions of BP then granted them exemptions from safety standards that would have prevented this catastrophe?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0110.21
Certainly BP is guilty of buying off our president, but our president is also guilty of willingly being bought off.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0110.22
Personally, I think I'll continue to buy BP products and boycott the corrupt Obama Administration that gave BP an exemption to safety standards.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0110.23
Blah blah blah...

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0112.28

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0112.29
But....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0112.30
Obama signed off on the drilling - and he did not regulate the industry prior to sign off.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0112.31
He's as responsible as BP, Transocean, the states and the American people who want cheap gas.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0113.2
The stupidity from you never ceases to amaze me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0113.3
You actually love mega-corps so much you think that their disasters are somoene else's problem.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0125.23
Exempting them from an ecological impact study isn't exactly giving them a free ride....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0125.24
All it was was a n ecological impact study it says nothing about them being exempt from any regulations...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0125.25
And the other link shows nothing other than they give money to both parties pretty much evenly...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0125.26
isn't that going against what we are told about big oil?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0125.27
Again none of this shows they were able to avoid any regulations...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0126.1
As someone who recently bought a place literally a stone's throw off the pristine beaches in South Walton Country, I am more than a little concerned about the oil slick hitting my piece of paradise.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0126.2
I am also against drilling off the Florida coast as an oil spill could have a devastating effect on our economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0126.3
However, I am not supporting a boycott of BP. As much as I do not like this disaster, and as much as I will want BP and the other energy companies to clean up this mess, and as much as I do not want to see this again, I do not think BP is the primary culprit in all this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0126.4
We as a society have chosen to drill in a very dangerous part of the world.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0126.5
Occasionally, disasters are going to happen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0126.6
We should do everything we can to prevent such disasters, but they will happen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0126.7
Boycotting BP doesn't do anything more to emphasize that they must take better care of their operations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0126.8
They already are aware.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0127.9

Interesting.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0137.2
You actually admit you don't know what Obama did or did not do and yet, despite admitting that you don't know all the facts, you have decided that BP are responsible.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0137.3
What a fucking moron.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0137.4
It doesn't really matter what Obama did or did not do, BP is legally responsible, it their fucking oil you dumb bitch.

Hey, sorry I asked you to justify something you said, i forget that you were a superior being.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.1
My point is that he does bear some responsibility.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.2
No matter whether it turns out to be BP's or Transocean's fault or, as is more likely, a combination of both, the President did not regulate before he agreed the drilling.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.3
I am fascinated that the rabid left refuse to recognize that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.4
You can bet your last dime that, if there was a GOP POTUS, they'd be howling for his blood.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.5
So does the President bear responsibility for every single tort that happens under his watch?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.6
Did he, or did he not, agree to the drilling.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.7
Him.

Not that he left in place an agreement from the previous administration....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.10
but he, as an actual individual.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.11
He agreed the drilling.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.12
He could have regulated and chose not to.

Where is the timeline in all of this?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.18
A rig just doesn't appear out of no where...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.19
or no when.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.20
When was the rig placed?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.21
When was the lease leased?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.22
So on and so on...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8789911_0138.23
Strangly a COMPLETE and coherant timeline seems difficult to google.

Without one blame is impossible to lay.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0019.2
I love how reuters calls them 'migrants' in the title, and illeagal aliens in the actual story.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0019.3
What I found interesting was the law may actually work, the illeagals are talking about leaving, which is what Arizona wanted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0019.4
Funny how that works out isn't it, upholding the law is 'racist'.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0019.5
upholding the law isn't what's racist.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0019.6
putting people who are LEGALLY here in fear of being stopped and arrested if they don't have papers IS.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0019.7
and no offense, hon, but when tom tancredo and al sharpton agree something goes too far, you're on the wrong side.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0019.8
it particularly amuses me when 'small government types' want the police to be able to stop you and demand papers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0019.9
So it's racist if the police ask an Hispanic person if they're here legally?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0019.10
I wouldn't call that racism.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0019.11
Since the law has passed, my hope is that this will force the federal government to revamp and enforce immigration law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0019.12
They've clearly failed in their duties.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0019.13
And once this happens, Arizona can get rid of this stupid law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0020.1
I think most will try California and if they can't get work there, return to Mexico.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0020.2
For once they feel they are not wanted if they came here illegally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0020.3
They will go where there is work.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0020.4
As long as we dont enforce the law that restricts employers to employ them, they will stay here.

if the police think you have committed a crime and you fit the description of the person they know committed the crime....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0021.10
don't the police have the right to stop you and question you.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0021.11
and why does everyone think the police are going to stop every non-white person they see....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0021.12
i would guess the police will go out of their way to be careful.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790688_0022.13
All it is is fear mongering by the left.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.1
About 80% of them have already.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.2
For instance if we made cars without robots it would take 10X the manpower to produce what we now produce.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.4
Actually, it's people who build the robots since not enough are being made to create an assembly line.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.5
It's people who make the precision parts the robots are made from.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.6
People who design the robots.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.7
People who are the technicians to maintain the robots.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.8
People who install and program the robots.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.9
People who design the parts the robots make.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.10
All that takes "education".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.11
Something Republicans "mock".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.12
Odd that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.13
yes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.14
anything that can be done without critical thinking can be programmed into a robot to do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.15
since building a robot from peices doesn't require critical thinking, one day robots will build robots and then humans will only be needed for trouble shooting, designing, and programming them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.16
I think those who have rejected science will finally realize their fautls at this point since there will be little jobs available for them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.17
even more advanced jobs could be taken over by robots if AI continues to improve, and of course if robots become capable of learning on their own then humans are no longerneeded at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.18
computers can only be as smart as whomever is programming them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.19
But they are extremely accurate and consistant.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0022.20
Much better than humans for many jobs actually.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0023.10
And of all that only the maintenance and perhaps the engineering is generally US provided.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0023.11
As far as the workers maintaining and manufacturing the robots.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0023.12
A tech education is a must, but almost equally as important is experience.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0023.13
I did that type of work for a few years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0023.14
It's the manufacturing too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0023.15
I have a friend who runs a machine shop.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0023.16
Their biggest money maker, railroad ties, was moved to Mexico.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0023.17
So they revamped their business to make high quality machined parts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0023.18
These are parts used in everything from the "medical industry" to "specialized tiny mechanisms".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0023.19
Stuff that are made in the hundreds or few thousand at the most.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0023.20
They even make stuff for the military or NASA.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0023.21

yes everything is being pushed to robots.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0027.6
as usual the usa military is leading the technological push, currently to militarize the entire armed forces, but with everything else all this R&D trickles down to the private sector.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0027.7
if people think drones and killer military bees are bad wait until the entire army is robotic which will happen in most's peoples lifetime who are reading this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0027.8
I'm sorry, I can't tell if you're joking or not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0027.9
Robots only become feasible if they are doing something that makes many thousands or millions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0027.10
Like cars.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0027.11
If it's only a few hundred, then the time it takes to program the robot and verify it's doing the task correctly, you could have the job already finished.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0027.12
So robots are limited.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0028.5
And all to few understand, therefore nothing will be done to avoid the slide.

American blue-collar workers are screwed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0048.5
Why?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0048.6
The average world labourer increases their standard of living by out-competing American workers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0048.7
They work harder and for less money, until they win their share of the industrial jobs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0048.8
In other words, for every American factory worker paid $40k a year, there are four Chinese/Indian/African factory workers being forced out on the street.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0048.9
Likewise, fore every American factory worker forced out on the street, there are four Chinese/Indian/African factory workers who start making a living wage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0048.10
Why will the Chinese/Indian/African worker win?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0048.11
The alternative for the Chinese/Indian/African worker is severe poverty, possibly starvation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0048.12
The alternative for the American worker is a welfare check that is bigger than the Chinese/Indian/African worker's entire paycheck.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0048.13
Thus, the situation of blue-collar America will not improve, even as the economy recovers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0048.14
Yes.

True.

It also makes no sense to insist on putting your own employer out of business with union greed.

Eventually you'll be initially screened at the hospital by a computer program, too.

There is almost nothing that people can do that sooner or later a robot or computer program won't be able to do better and or cheaper.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.5
And you know what that really means?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.6
The end of capitalism as we know it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.7
Seriously, you cannot have capitalism when 80% or more of the population isn't employable because tecnology is doing the jobs they once did.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.8
And no, this problem we're just now beginning to face is magnitudes larger in terms of disrupting our labor patterns than the industrial revolution ever was.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.9
Because in that revolution, farming help went to work in factories.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.10
They STILL had jobs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.11
In the technolgical revolution, factory workers (and the mangament which once oversaw their work) and highly skilled workers (like Doctors, lawyers, and other professional INCLUDING SOFTWARE ENGINEERS) are going to find that they cannot compete with technology, and AI pprograms either.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.12
Then how does our economic system work?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.13
Do we continue to only reward those elements of our society who OWN the technology?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.14
And who will be the consumers buying all this techologically made wealth when nobody has a job to make the money to buy it all, anyway?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.15
Remember now, this problem is aleady starting to include highly educated people whose jobs are better done by machines and programs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.16
Should we let the majority of the society starve?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.17
Our technology is going to change our economic system, folks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.18
Count on that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.19
And the transition from industrial capitalism to technology capitalism isn't going to be easy on the MAJORITY of us regardless of how well we educate ourselves.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.20
yes you are close, but not all poisitons in science and engineering will be overtaken.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.21
AI is not to where a robot learn say a physics undergrad worth of knowledge without it being programmed into him (which isn't learning obviously).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.22
unless there is a major breakthrough in AI or robots can be programmed to learn on their own, the high end science & engineering jobs will still be human done.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8791594_0071.23
the resst of the population as you say, probably greather than 80% will be replaced by machines with no jobs available whetehr its because tehy are too old to learn the science needed or just refused to learn science along the way.

We are talking about situational awareness type of intellegence as it relates to knowing where your enemy is and him knowing where you are

What I do know is that todays cutting edge, is tomorrows dinosaur.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792054_0036.10
It's just not safe to cut that much out in NASA
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792054_0037.1
We spend more on defense that every other country combined.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792054_0037.2
If we have anything to fear from the Russians (or anyone else), then we are getting the royal screw job from Congress, the Pentagon, and the defense contractors.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792054_0038.1

I think cutting the nonessentials would be fine...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792054_0055.6
but cutting our defense budget during two wars and in essence grounding us isn't exactly very bright.

None of it would exist if it wasn't used to reduce weight on our spacecraft.

The purpose of the space program isn't to install WMD on the moon capable of blowing up certain countries.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792054_0055.17
As he does correctly point out, the space program does provide us with technology, some of which deters war or even prevents the threat of war.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792054_0058.1
Yet another thread on this topic, first lets get this straight the Presidents budget did not cut any MONEY, it CUT and re-tasked program(s) within NASA and the DoD.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792054_0058.2
In fact the President raised the funding, so why then would Republicans be for any of that based on a fiscal level when it adds to the deficit and accomplishes NOTHING.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792054_0058.3
Starting with the F-22 and ending it's production at 187 in favor of the F-35 which by the way is an average aircraft at best in terms of performance and the US Navy is calling into question operating costs on that aircraft and due to these factors Sec.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792054_0058.4
Gates yesterday fired the program manager for the F-35 project and is holding back 614 million in funding until these issues are addressed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792054_0058.5
One of those issues is the F-35's failure to perform well against current Russian, American, and EU 4th generation fighters.

However there is a new player in the India aircraft needs and that the F-16IN which is a "super cruise" version of the F-16 purpose built for India based on the F-16XL technology and using the F-35 Radar system which is the feature of the F-35 JSF that makes it a worthy aircraft.

A Russian cargo freighter flying on autopilot performed a successful rendezvous and docking with the space station Thursday night, delivering two-and-a-half tons of supplies and equipment for the international outpost and its resident crew.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792054_0078.3
While flying 212 miles over the extreme southwestern Atlantic, the Progress M-04M spacecraft linked up to the aft docking port of the station's Zvezda service module at 11:26 p.m. EST. "Docking confirmed.

After arriving in range of the space station, the vessel began a flyaround maneuver to get lined up with the docking port and then executed a roll maneuver to properly orient its forward docking probe with Zvezda.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792054_0078.12
A brief stationkeeping hold with about 530 feet between the freighter and station allowed Russian flight controllers to assess systems before giving approval to commence the 10-minute final approach.

sure, it's a study run by some religious wingnut zealot at some christian cow college, but it seems that abstinence only sex education is much more effective in preventing teen pregnancies and STDs than either traditional general health courses or courses that focus on safe sex.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792098_0018.2
it should also be noted that abstinence in this case does not refer to abstinence until marriage.

A study of middle-school students that found for the first time that abstinence-only education helped to delay their sexual initiation is already beginning to shake up the longstanding debate over how best to prevent teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792098_0018.6
This is a rigorous study that means we can now say that its possible for an abstinence-only intervention to be effective, Dr. John B. Jemmott III, the University of Pennsylvania professor who led the study, said Tuesday, hours after results of the study were released.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792098_0018.7
Thats important, because for some populations, abstinence is the only acceptable message.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792098_0018.8
In Dr. Jemmotts research, only about a third of the students who participated in a weekend abstinence-only class started having sex within the next 24 months, compared with about half who were randomly assigned instead to general health information classes, or classes teaching only safer sex.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792098_0018.9
Among those assigned to comprehensive sex-education classes, covering both abstinence and safer sex, about 42 percent began having sex.

The United States apparently possesses an "earthquake weapon" that set off the catastrophic quake in Haiti and killed 200,000 innocents.

Don't believe it's true?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792370_0027.3
Just ask Hugo Chavez.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792370_0027.4
Citing an alleged report from Russia's Northern Fleet, the Venezuelan strongman's state mouthpiece ViVe TV shot out a press release saying the 7.0 magnitude Haiti quake was caused by a U.S. test of an experimental shockwave system that can also create "weather anomalies to cause floods, droughts and hurricanes."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792370_0027.5
The station's Web site added that the U.S. government's HAARP program, an atmospheric research facility in Alaska (and frequent subject of conspiracy theories), was also to blame for a Jan. 9 quake in Eureka, Calif., and may have been behind the 7.8-magnitude quake in China that killed nearly 90,000 people in 2008.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792370_0027.6
What's more, the site says, the cataclysmic ruin in Haiti was only a test run for much bigger game: the coming showdown with Iran.

Even as a Ron Paul supporter I support helping another country with humanitarian aid in a time like this...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.3
but using the RESERVES??
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.4
That's not a job of the reserve component.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.5
Those men and women are supposed to be the last line of defense here on our shores, and to augment the active duty forces during a time of war or national emergency.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.6
National emergency meaning, US national emergency.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.7
This is a misuse of the reserves if you ask me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.8
As if it wasn't bad enough that Bush pretty much back door drafted most of them into Iraq, now Obama is bringing them into Haiti in a clear misuse of their purpose.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.9
I'm already certain the comments on this are going to be pretty evenly divided down partisan lines, too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.10
I can understand why Obama is doing this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.11
The amount of warlords and gangs down there is preventing aid to getting to the people who need it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.12
Obviously sending some reserves are suppose to combat that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.13

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.14
I can understand the use of them in war despite Bush's abuse of that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.15
But the last lines of defense on our shores?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.16
Who exactly are you expecting to show up?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.17

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0029.22
It would be cool if, just once in a while, we recognized that we are not the only damned nation in the world that offers aid and assistance to those in need.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0030.1
I am not saying anyone turned down our help, I am saying some countries offered helped during Katrina and were turned down.

Thirty pages.

Table listing countries offering aid and assistance after Katrina ( many more than I had found in my above post), and those denied/rejected by the US.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.6
CREWs matrix is based on 25,000 Department of State (DOS) documents it received as a result of a lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information Act in December 2005 for records relating to the federal governments handling and acceptance of international offers of aid after Hurricane Katrina.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.7
The matrix includes all international offers, whether they were rejected or accepted and the reasons why, if available.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.8
The documents reveal a number of disturbing responses to offers from 145 countries and 12 international organizations from around the world.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.9
For example, an email from Jeffrey Goldstein, a U.S. Embassy official in Estonia, to several DOS officials, states:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.10
It is getting downright embarrassing here not to have a response to the Estonians on flood relief.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.11
And now I see from the staff meeting notes that the task force may disband soon.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.12
We know that what the Estonians can offer is small potatoes and everyone at FEMA is swamped, but at this point even thanks but no thanks is better than deafening silence.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.13
Another email responding to an offer from Argentina to DOS officials reads All, The (sic) word here is that doctors of any kind are in the 'forget about it' category.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.14
Human assistance of any kind is not on our priorities list....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.15
Its all about goods, not people, at this point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.16
Another email describes how the transport of Israeli relief supplies loaded on a C-130 aircraft was delayed for over 48 hours on the tarmac while Israeli officials waited for clearance from the U.S. government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.17
The unidentified author states: Ive been on the phone with the [Israeli] attache every couple of hours since noon...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.18
theyre patient, but not amused by our delay, obviously. The documents do not reveal if or how the issue was resolved.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.19
Melanie Sloan, CREWs executive director said today, A review of the State Department documents reveals distressing ineptitude.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792505_0056.20
Countries were trying to donate desperately needed goods and services, but as a result of bureaucratic bungling and indifference, those most in need of these generous offers of aid never received it.

WICHITA (AP)  A Kansas judge has again refused to block a confessed abortion clinic killer from arguing in court that he should be spared a murder conviction because he believed he was saving unborn children.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792613_0001.3
Judge Warren Wilbert dealt prosecutors a setback during a hearing Tuesday.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8792613_0001.4
He said that until the defense decides which evidence it will present, it's difficult for him to rule out Scott Roeder's proposed defense claim in the killing of Dr. George Tiller in Wichita, Kansas, last May.

bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949028_0001.3
(Reuters) - Texas unveiled the second of six new 'interceptor' gunboats on Thursday, similar to Navy swift boats that plied the rivers of Vietnam during the Vietnam War, to patrol the waterways of the Mexico border.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949028_0001.4
The Texas Department of Public Safety, which oversees the Texas Highway Patrol and the Texas Rangers, said the 34-foot shallow water crafts would be deployed on the Rio Grande and the Intercoastal Waterway, which separates the Texas mainland from Padre Island.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949028_0001.5
"They have night vision capabilities, they have ballistic shielding, and the first couple of boats have fully automatic machine guns," department spokesman Tom Vinger told Reuters.

The shooting occurred as protesters threw rocks at police, government buildings and a U.N. office in eastern Afghanistan, kicking off a fifth day of riots sparked by the burning of Korans at a U.S. base, officials said.

KABUL  The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan on Saturday recalled all NATO personnel working in Afghan ministries in the Kabul area  a bold and potentially divisive response to the killing of two American service members by an Afghan security official in the countrys fortified Interior Ministry earlier in the day.

Marine Gen. John R. Allens directive comes five days after U.S. military personnel burned a pile of Korans at the largest military base in Afghanistan in an apparently inadvertent act that set off violent protests across the country.

More than 25 Afghans have died in those demonstrations, and four NATO soldiers have been killed by men wearing Afghan security uniforms since Thursday, when the Taliban urged Afghan soldiers and police to turn their weapons on their Western counterparts.

The weeks events have exposed a core vulnerability of the Obama administrations strategy for winding down the decade-long Afghan war: a fraying trust between two presumed allies who must depend on each other to keep the insurgency at bay.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949380_0016.13
Although mutual suspicions have been building for some time, the Koran burnings followed by the apparent revenge killings of U.S. military personnel will make it much harder for both sides to agree in the coming weeks on the specific terms and timetable of NATOs planned withdrawal from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.

Another "isolated case"
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0001.1
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press – 15 minutes ago · WASHINGTON (AP) – House Republicans put aside their usual antipathy toward President Barack Obama on Wednesday to give the president, and his successors, the line-item veto, a constitutionally questionable power over the purse that long has been sought by presidents of both parties.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0001.2
A minority of Democrats joined in casting a 254-173 vote in favor of allowing the president to pick out specific items in spending bills for elimination.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0001.3
Currently, the chief executive must sign or veto spending bills in their entirety.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0001.4
The main opposition came from members of the Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for putting together the annual spending bills.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0001.5
They argued that the bill upsets the constitutional separation of powers balance in favor of the executive branch, and that recent efforts to curtail so-called earmarks in spending bills make the line-item veto unnecessary.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0001.6
The bill now goes to the Senate, where its prospects are uncertain.

of politicans in the right wing leaning, authoritarian quadrant of the political spectrum vs those closer to the libertarian point of view, Obama has given the authoritarians no reason for concern, he's one of them.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0005.5
The Republicans know that even if Obama were to win reelection, the corporate media will still continue to enable and depict poltiicians in the right wing, authoritarian quadrant as being the "moderates," "centrists," "mainstream" to power whether it be in the White House or the Congress.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0005.6
Even if Obama were to surprise them and deviate from authoritarianism, the long term dynamic would be set to correct itself.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0005.7
The peoples' representatives in Congress would be weakened and subjugated to a central figure; the same one which can on his/her authority alone have any American killed or imprisoned indefinitely as Donald Trump would say, that American is fired.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0005.8

bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0012.5
His lasting legacy is as the "Leach" in "Gramm-Leach-Bliley" bill that repealed Glass-Stegall
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0012.6
I started asking him about the budget in 2004 as the Bush deficits mounted and he would never answer me.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0012.7
At one of his town halls he made this incredible statement about how great line item veto would be.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0012.8
I interrupted and said "If the President controls the budget, what does congress do?"
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0012.9

bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0016.3
seems like the repugs like to put this on the bill in a Presidential election year when they think they can get the President away from a Dem.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0016.4
When it passed (1996), and Clinton was re-elected, the SCOTUS found the legislation "unconstitutional"...
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0016.5
Wouldn't surprise me if the SCOTUS would find it "unconstitutional" again...

bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0022.3
I don't care who is president, the line item veto is a massive transfer of power from the legislature to the executive.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0022.4
On a tactical level it also destroys any impetus for compromise within a legislative body as it means that any concessions and compromises reached will merely be crossed off by the president of one party or another.

bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0023.2
I don't know if I can support this line-item veto......
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0023.3
As long as the legislation is clear that the President can veto individual line item(s) to make clear the portions with which he/she disagree, I can support it.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0023.4
But it must be understood that the legislation, so amended, must go back to the House and Senate for approval or for an override of the items so vetoed.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0023.5
I do not want a unitary executive.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0023.6
Congressional earmarks are a mess but then we the electorate need to do a better job in who we vote for.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0023.7
But we cannot let the President modify the legislation passed by Congress by striking out items that are from his/her perspective undesirable and then signing the bill into law.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0023.8
The amended legislation must be re-submitted and approved by Congress.

13
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0024.2
I can support a line item veto - as long as we get there via a Constitutional amendment.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0024.3
Doing it
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0024.4
by mere legislation will not hold up in court.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0024.5
Most governors have this power - along with the requirement to balance the budget.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0024.6
The power applies only to budget line items, not other types of legislation.

House wants to have its pork and eat it, too.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0040.3
Here is how the scam will work.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0040.4
This way, if the House load bills that have to pass---like military funding---with pork(which they have to do, this being an election year) Obama will be the one who is forced to either veto it (alienating voters) or sign it----at which point it becomes his pork and the Congressman who wrote it was just doing his job for his constituents while the GOP House as a whole can claim that it is trying to cut government spending but Obama will not let them.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0040.5
For instance, military says a certain bomber is unneeded.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0040.6
House member for that district---say, in a purple state like Ohio---wants it built.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0040.7
Obama can either veto the bomber--and lose votes in a purple state.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0040.8
Or he lets the bill through, at which point the House member wins easy re-election.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0040.9
This strategy depends upon the GOP having lots of SuperPac money to ran wall to wall ads that say something along the lines of "You lost your job at Boeing because Obama cut spending for the ___bomber."
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0040.10
In case he does not veto the unnecessary spending, the Super Pacs will run "Obama authorized money for a bomber that the Pentagon said it does not need" in other districts hit hard by the economy.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0040.11
Solution to this problem: Senate should kill the line item veto now---and then bring it up against next year after Obama is re-elected.

There does seem to be a tendency for Congress to reject its powers

We already have "war powers" rules that, while maintaining some tiny fig leaf of retroactive accountability, essentially cede to the President the ability to wage undeclared wars.
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0043.4
And now they want to let the President have the power to pick away at spending bills?
bolt-eng-DF-183-195681-7949942_0043.5
Note that this is a one-way power - its use only reduces spending.

I don't, of course, read the Possum's posts--on those few occasions when i have, and have responded, i've always realized it's foolish and a waste of time, because all it wants is an opportunity to pick a fight, and it is never interested in the accuracy of it's statements.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809814_0128.3
I did think, though, that it would worth while to point out that "quote mining" is part of the Possum's MO.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809814_0128.4
Quote mining is taking someone's remarks, and taking portions of them out of context to attempt to distort the actual meaning of what the person in question has said.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809814_0128.5
This is a favorite technique of the creationists, who love to indulge quote mining to make it appear that reputable scientists reject a theory of evolution.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809814_0130.12
The fact is, Panzade, that I rubbed Setanta's nose in it with my exposition, where I gave evidence that Setanta did not, indeed, could not, rebut, to the effect that the NAZIS were, in many respects, left wingers, not right wingers, in their policies and proposals.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809814_0130.13
One point serves to show how Setanta was wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809814_0130.14
The Nazis( which I proved in my posts giving direct evidence and quotes were strongly opposed to Christianity and Roman Catholics in Germany.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809814_0130.15
Only someone who either knows nothing about the period or about the Catholic Church can call the Nazis "right-wing" in that respect.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809814_0130.16
The left, Stalin, especially, opposed the Church.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809814_0130.17
The Catholic Church in the twentieth century must be viewed as a conservative right wing force.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809814_0130.18
And the Nazis were against the Catholic Church.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809814_0130.19
These, and scores of other points, Panzade, are points which Setanta dare not address since it will show that his old notes( cribbed from Howard Zinn's books?)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809814_0130.20

The whole man over women thing I always thought had it's origins from the hunter gatherer era, and then sort of died out with the socialist era, where women no longer relied on men for survival of themselves and their children, rather the state.

The only big thing that concerns me over the differences is the emotional differences, which in my opinion are more learned as parents reward emotionalism with girls with comfort, and reward boys with emotionalism with scorn and discipline.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809822_0029.6
I think this hinders the ability for the sexes to relate to each other and creates the impression of weakness in women.

IMO, boys need to be allowed a wee bit more to cry and express their emotions and girls need to not be allowed to as much as children, in other words, they should be treated equally in this arena, and encouraged to express positive emotions and discouraged from negative ones.

I agree that we can focus on just the H. sapien, the humanbeing, but also realize that by doing such, we will not be cutting the line of continuum with all other life forms that are, and have been.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809822_0030.5
By focusing on the H. sapien, for example, we will not be giving consideration to the H. neandertahlensis, H. heidelbeergensis, H. erectus, H. rudolfensis, P. robustus, and so on, or, even, the H. sapiens idaltu (which is very intermmediate in build--globular braincase) We would not be focusing on the Great Apes, even our very near relatives the chimpanzees (including the bonobo), regardless of the overlap in genetic material we share.

I'm not sure that you are really asking the right question, william, because once genetic, genital, and gender identity are set, we have no way of changing that (which is basically why homosexuality was finally deleted from the list of disorders to be correct by psychologists...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809822_0055.3

bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809822_0055.4
You see, all this hormone stuff is simply (and mostly) 'up stream' events from genetical events which build us, and set us organisms off on a cetain track.

Enviornment and personal history will, nevertheless, have some effect, but case after case has taught us that there is very little chance of altering the 'hard wiring' after birth.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809822_0055.8
This is one major reason why I see problems with the set-up you are insisting on, namely, that some (not all) elements of your proposition attempt to work cross-grain with nature itself.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809822_0055.9
There will without doubt be some genetic and genital males who will be as good (and some even better) at raising children than some genetic and genital females will be.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809822_0055.10
Therefore any attempt to blindly draw lines along what we see on the outside as being a gender, is not good enough.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809822_0055.11
Also, this will surely draw more focus on the idea of 'equality' in the pair-bonded setting--that is, equality between two human beings first and foremost.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809822_0055.12
A number of applications can be made; one being that rather than acquiescing any role of 'final-decision-maker-in-disagreement-situations' on either of the two in a pair bond situation based on sexual state, we would find a greater leverage in rendering that role to the one of better qualification for the particular task at hand.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6809822_0055.13

My father at 86, his body growing weak, refused to live with anyone else.

And definitely didn't want to go into a nursing home.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0023.5
That was the ultimate insult to him.

@firefly,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0026.2
Firefly, aging is an assault upon the ego, as we lose independence, mobility, and as chronic pain sets in. Some people master the aging process however, let go of their ego ways enough that they can enjoy these years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0026.3
Check out Ram Dass in "Still here" Riverhead Books, 2000.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0026.4
Meds only help a bit with this, the primary tool needed is a healthy outlook on life in general and aging in particular.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.1
@hawkeye10,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.2
Oh, I agree completely, hawkeye.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.3
A healthy outlook on life is essential--at any age.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.4
Any pre-existing personality problems are simply likely to intensify as we get older and are confronted with more and more challenges, obstacles, and losses.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.5
That's why I know that, in part, some of my mother's problems are due to her personality make-up, and how she has always coped with change, and not just due to the stress of advanced aging.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.6
You really do have to let go of parts of yourself, and change your image of yourself, as aging takes it's toll.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.7
But, by the time you are in your 90's, I think that most people have learned to weather those assaults on one's ego.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.8
They couldn't have survived that long if they didn't do that.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.9
But everyone may have a breaking point, a final indignity or loss that is just too much to bear.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.10
And, certainly when you are over 90, your emotional stamina for coping with things may really be wearing down.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.11
When I look at my mother, I still see a reasonably vital woman with the physical and mental abilities, and energy, to enjoy a very good quality of life, if only she would be willing to make some changes and push herself out of the house, and fight her depression a little more.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.12
However, my mother keeps saying to me, "You don't understand what it's like to be 94".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.13
And she is right.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.14
I don't know what that is like.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.15
Her doctors don't know what's that like either.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.16
Once in a blue moon, she will run into another person in their 90's, but it's pretty infrequent.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.17
A lot of the time she feels like an oddity, or a curiosity, because she is so much older than everyone else in just about every situation she is in, even if no one else actually knows her age (and she looks considerably younger than she is).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.18
I don't know what it feels like to have lived for 94 years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.19
I don't know what a 94 year old body or brain feels like, even if they are in pretty good shape.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.20
I don't know what it's like to have to leave a job I loved, or stop driving my car, because I just couldn't keep up anymore, and my abilities were failing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.21
I don't have to experience an enormous, daily gap between what I would like to do, and what I am able to do.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.22
I don't know what kind of emotional and physical stamina one must muster to keep going at 94.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.23
I do have to cope with my own age-related problems--in my case, chronic severe back pain--but I do not feel my essential personhood dimished by such things.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.24
My mother has reached a point where she feels less of a person, where the person she was is rapidly ebbing away, and some of this is due to neurological changes in her brain.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.25
That's not just an ego assault, it really is the final blow of very advanced age.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.26
I'm not sure that one can have a healthy outlook about that sort of thing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.27
At best, I think one can only deal with it by resignation, and, if possible, some humor.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.28
Fortunately, my mother's sense of humor is still alive and kicking.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.29
Apart from giving my mother support, encouragement, etc. I try to let her make her own decisions about things.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.30
I did not insist she stop driving, for instance, the final decision was hers.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.31
I'm not insisting she consider an assisted living facility, although I can see where such a situation might have some advantages for her.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.32
I'm more than willing to care for her and to make sure that her life is as good as it can be.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.33
I respect her enough to not deprive her of her dignity and independence any more than what mother nature is already doing to her.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.34
So, hawkeye, I'm not really sure that any of us can really tell a 94 year old what a healthy outlook on life should be.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.35
I'm more inclined to think we should focus on trying to learn from the extremely elderly, since they have weathered this trip longer than we have, and they must be doing something right.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810873_0027.36
It's also the best way for us to prepare for our own advanced years.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0005.1
@BrightNoon,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0005.2
I am not entirely without hope.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0005.3
Some small shift beyond the oil economy is already occurring.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0005.4
Don't forget the human species is capable of rapid adaptation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0005.5
And especially countries like the US have shown they can adapt real quickly if they have too.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0005.6
We saw evidence of that adaptability in the days of the new deal and again in the rapid transition from peacetime to wartime economy in the years 1917-1918 and 1941-1945.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0005.7
While some of the worlds wealth may be redistributed to other parts of the world the US is still the leading technology driver.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0005.8
That power can also drive a rapid change away from oil.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0006.1
@BrightNoon,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0006.2
We can safely assume that the amount of petroleum is finite even though we can assume also that new discoveries of addition sources and improved extraction methods may extend the life of oil-based technologies, and that our needs will eventually absorb the resource.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0006.3
We cannot precisely predict when the crises will occur, but we understand its inevitability.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0006.4
This crisis will be a global problem and will be resolved globally.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0006.5
We can, however, begin at once to reduce our usage of oil and oil products, invest in the development of alternative sources of energy and move ever more towards their use, and fund both technological and scientific innovations.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0007.1
@jgweed,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0007.2
It seems like we're all pretty much in agreement; the current global order cannot be survive, unless there are extremely rapid deployments of renewable energy technologies.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0007.3
If we will be presented with a choice between collectivization on a global scale or death, I must admit, I choose death: i.e. mad max style chaos.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0007.4
In any case, I wanted to bring up an analogy, often misused, but that I think is relavant here.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0007.5
There widely differing opinions about the causes of the collapse of the Roman Empire, but the general consensus is that the Roman military system became unsustainable and was replaced with a mercenary system because an economic collapse, beginning around the reign of Septimius Severus.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0007.6
Now, here is the part relevant to all of us.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0007.7
This economic collapse was basically the result of the unfortnuate Roman habit of importing huge quantities of very expensive, luxery goods from Asia, which were paid for in hard currency.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0007.8
The Mediterranean's old mines were unable to keep up with the losses, resulting in a profound debasement of the currency and in masive inflation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0007.9
Quite a few of the Emperor's in the later period tried and failed to enforce strict price controls in response.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0007.10
The basic problem, with differences is detail, was the same as that faced by the United States today; we have a masive and growing trade deficit, resulting from our import of cheap manufactures and oil.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0007.11
We don't have hard currency, so this money can be replaced physcially, but we are similiarly being hollowed out, because of the government policy of constantly encouraging spending, much of which leaves the country via those imports.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0007.12
Anyhow, I couldn't reists bringing this up, cliche as it is.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0008.1
@BrightNoon,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0008.2
There's more to it I am afraid.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0008.3
If we can fix the peak oil problem technology and its survival-of-the-fittest driven abuse will simply lead us to the next crisis.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6810984_0008.4
A worldwide change of attitude is what we really need to survive as humanity.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0004.1
I don't know what the economy looks like in Mass, and most of what you say I agree with, but geography plays a big part in this.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0004.2
For example, a one company town (there are many) where the one company closes up and moves out leaves a lot of people with similar skillsets rooted in a particular area.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0004.3
The cost of moving is often prohibitive for people of lower incomes so they are pretty much at the mercy of their employer.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0004.4
A business in this town could pretty much name its price for these workers.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0004.5
But I make that argument without much conviction because, as I said, I'm undecided.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0004.6
I don't know enough about economics to foresee what the consequences are of leaving it as is or removing it altogether.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0004.7

if you are working for a living, yes
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0007.1
Considering some employers will only pay the absolute bare minimum to workers, les if they were allowed, I think minimum wage is important.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0007.2
It doesn't pay enough as it is...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0007.3
can you imagine what some employers would do to workers if they didn't have to pay them a certain wage?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0008.1
At a certain point you become a slave.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0008.2
You make just enough to survive to work for the boss.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0008.3
You exist merely to produce for the boss.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0008.4
Only when the worker takes action in numbers is it any different.

When we got to LA, I knew there were tough parts of town.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0064.11
I married a guy who'd lived at the heart of south LA until he met me and he'd lived two blocks from Florence and Normandie his whole life, a neighborhood with some tough stuff going on.

But me, at fourteen, when I saw what they considered a tough neighborhood in LA, I thought, eh!

I don't think a "National" minimum wage makes any sense, since the purchasing power varies wildly from State to State.

The issue of a national minimum wage is complex, because as somebody already mentioned, the cost of living ain't the same across the US - or even from community to community in the same county.

The big increase per customer?....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0087.21
17 cents.

Minimum wage jobs have historically been considered as entry-level jobs with the hope of advancing into better pay with time and experience.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0088.3
The trickle-up effect of increasing the minimum wage applies to everyone on the payscale grid.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0088.4
If you've been working at minimum wage for a couple years and have moved into a better paying job then chances are your going to expect a wage increase once the minimum wage increases to maintain your well-earned compensation gap above the entry-level employee.

President Bush used to proclaim that illegal immigrants were taking "jobs Americans don't want."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0090.5
He more recently adjusted his rhetoric to refer more accurately to "jobs Americans are not taking."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0090.6
If the jobs paid more, more Americans probably would take them.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0090.7
But that runs the risk of reducing profits for employers or raising prices for consumers.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0090.8

In answer to flushd - I don't have a concrete solution (if I did I would run for office) - just it doesn't appear (in most cases) that minimum wage will actually help people it is supposed to help.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0091.3
I could be wrong, but in most cases it seems to just push prices up.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0091.4
The other big problem I see is it ends up harming small businesses.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0091.5
Larger businesses like the WalMarts could absorb the costs, however smaller businesses may not.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0091.6
I picture a mom and pop type store that can only afford low wages.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0091.7
Perhaps some one that works there does so for a second income or like my dad did for something to keep him busy.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0091.8
Now why wouldn't they work for WalMart that would pay him more (as at least in my area they pay above minimum wage any way)?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0091.9
Because he likes the owners, it is a nice friendly place to work, pleasant working environment (not everyone works just for he paycheck).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0091.10
But now minimum wage increases, mom and pop cannot afford to keep the store open without losing money - they close.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0092.1
If minimum wage did help the poor - meaning overall prices would not increase (however, this is not possible if the minimum wage is set above the equilibrium wages) then I would say sure it makes perfect sense.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0092.2
And if there was no effect to the smaller businesses then again I would say sure.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0092.3
Another point is if minimum wage keeps increasing, the demand to hire illegals would also increase.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0092.4
Why wouldn't you risk hiring some one that would work for pennies, if the increased costs of hiring others is so high, that the risks of getting caught becomes worthwhile?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0092.5
I am also all for raising the minimum wage IF it does help the people it is intended to - the question is.does it?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0092.6
That is what I am proposing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0092.7
So far not one person has given any hard facts or support that it does.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0092.8
Honestly, raising the minimum wage really won't personally affect me one way or the other.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0092.9
My concern is it is all for naught?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0092.10
Not even looking at the economy as a whole - is it doing anything for the poor?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0092.11
If Mr. Poor gets an increase in salary of $100 a month and then his food costs, electricity, rent, etc goes up by $100 is he any better off?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0092.12
That is the question I am posing - not that we shouldn't help others.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0092.13

bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0093.1
The problem squinney is the CEOs have enough control to raise their wages and bonuses.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0093.2
It does happen sometimes that these CEOs are thoughtful and kind enough to not collect a bonus or raise in times where the economy is down, but typically they keep the same or increase.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0093.3
I remember a couple of years ago where I did not get a raise (two years in a row) because the company profits were down.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0093.4
I didn't cry - I realized I was lucky got a good paying job when others were being laid off - I doubt our CEO did without though.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0093.5
And I know of another large company where employees were being laid off because of a downturn, but Mr. CEO still got his huge bonus.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0093.6
As terrible as this is - how does increasing the minimum wage solve this?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0093.7
Mr. CEO will still get his big paycheck and bonus (do you really think he is going to cut his money?)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0093.8
He will either raise prices or make cutbacks (layoffs perhaps) - both these will come back and bite the little guy - not help him.

Rehi to those that recall me from the old (abuzz) days and not-so-old days here.

ragman, It's a pleasure to see you on a2k.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0112.2
I remember you from the Abuzz days, and if my memory serves, we agreed on most of the important stuff.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.1
I agree Ragman completely that people making minimum cannot financially survive.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.2
That is not my contention of debate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.3
My issue is that raising the minimum wage will not help - if it did I would support it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.4
What you state is not basic economics - it is what many people assume happens.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.5
If you studied even Introductory economics you would realize that the math you state does not work.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.6
The reason why so many Americans support an increase in minimum wage is because they understand there is a problem for people earning that amount, however, the average American doesn't understand what the downstream effects are.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.7
Basic economics: As I stated before if you make $100 a month, but your costs to survive (food, rent and other basics) cost $200 you are out of luck.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.8
So one would think logically that raising your income by $100 would work - it would if everything remained the same.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.9
Unfortunately it will not.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.10
When doubling your wages - these costs then increase to your employer - the employer will either have to cut costs (i.e. lay someone off) or raise their prices.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.11
This same thing is happening to all the other businesses.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.12
Now the poor sap who either now does not have a job because he is laid off is now worse off.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.13
Or doubles his salary, but now his rent, food, etc. costs him $300 month.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.14
He is still $100 behind.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.15
Can some one who supports minimum wage increase please give me some facts of how it will help some one?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.16
I haven't yet.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.17
It seems ragman tried, but his reasoning is flawed.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0113.18
He is not taking into consideration the downstream effects.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0114.1
An actual quote from ragman's article " "If we do not balance a minimum-wage increase with economic relief for the small businesses, we will stifle job creation and shut the employment door on the very individuals we are trying to help," said Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0114.2
, author of the GOP alternative. "
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0114.3
Just because the polls show it is overwhelmingly supported doesn't mean it is a good thing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0114.4
Unfortunately people are naively thinking this increase will help people, whereas best case it leaves them where they are financially (their buying power will stay the same); worse case they lose their jobs.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.1
As in the article talking about disemployment - what else was going on in the economy at the time - many things effect the economy at the same time - did this happen to be a time of a growing economy?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.2
As a matter of fact these were years when the economy was growing.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.3
So an increase in minimum wage did not cause this increase in employment and hiring - our economy was already in a growing period.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.4
Perhaps employment went up, but would have gone up even more if it were not for an increase in minimum wage.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.5
Simply put just because something occurs after an event does not mean that event caused it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.6
Also, this increase in minimum wage could have still been below the normal market price for wages - currently in Mass this is the case, so I honestly see no or little effect to an increase in the minimum wage - which is essentially what I have been saying all along.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.7
Minimum wage really has little impact - and certainly does not help out people.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.8
Everything was growing in those years, not as a result of minimum wage increase.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.9
Do you really think the stock market huge increases were a result of minimum wage increase?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.10
Most likely the reason that in high minimum wage states employment grew more quickly was more likely the opposite result.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.11
Minimum wage was increased because there was so much employment opportunity - not the other way around.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.12
Also higher minimum wage states also were higher cost of living states (like Mass).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.13
One other thing to note - Anyone can twist stats to suit there needs.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.14
I am sure you can also go to a time period that will show the opposite affects of increasing the minimum wage too.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.15
When doing an analysis such as this several time periods should be viewed.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.16
By limiting your analysis to one 3 year period, right there the results cannot be verified - too many things affect the economy and when doing economic analysis (if you want an unbiased result) you will take these other things into consideration as well as look at various time periods.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.17
I checked the source and don't let the name fool you EPI standing for Economic Policy Issue would lead one to think it was a non-biased Economic government type of board.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.18
It is not - it is a propaganda that "supports he economic condition of low- and middle-income Americans and their families".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0115.19
Not that there is anything wrong with supporting low and middle-income families (I fall into this), but right there you realize if they are supporting one group thus you are biased in your analysis.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0123.1
Ditto Thomas - My basic premise is that minimum wage (in most cases) will not have an impact - other than the possibility of people being laid off.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0123.2
I simply cannot write as eloquently as Thomas.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0123.3
Yes, price is affected by increased costs, indirectly.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0123.4
It has an affect on supply.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0123.5
If costs go up there is a shift of the supply curve resulting in higher prices.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0123.6
I suggested the basic economics in it seemed some people didn't understand the basic cost/supply relationship - and many people in their thoughtful wish to help others less fortunate only correlate higher salary = more spending power without looking at the downstream impacts (or lack thereof).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0123.7
If it sounded like an insult or talking down to anyone I apologize it was meant more as if you haven't a background in the subject how could you realize all the impacts.

Realjohnboy - disposable income will increase for those individuals receiving the increase in salary, but for those that get laid off it won't - so net someone gets $0 and some one else receives double.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0123.10
That nets the same.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0123.11
Sam gets an increase to $200, Fred gets $0 being laid off so disposable income prior to rise in minimum wage is $200 and after $200.

From one of my favorite dictionaries:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0124.2
Causes of Inflation · Economists wake up in the morning hoping for a chance to debate the causes of inflation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0124.3
There is no one cause that's universally agreed upon, but at least two theories are generally accepted:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0124.4
Demand-Pull Inflation - This theory can be summarized as "too much money chasing too few goods".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0124.5
In other words, if demand is growing faster than supply, prices will increase.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0124.6
This usually occurs in growing economies.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0124.7
Cost-Push Inflation - When companies' costs go up, they need to increase prices to maintain their profit margins.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0124.8
Increased costs can include things such as wages, taxes, or increased costs of imports.

Yes, there are many variables that affect prices, and trying to explain it through one company is not realistic.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0126.1
Of course individuals companies do not - I was using this as an example to simply things - just increase this to include the apple industry as a whole as the minimum wage would affect all those businesses.

I had to look it up:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0130.2
According to numerous sources, approximately 30 million workers between the ages of 18 and 64 earn less than $9 an hour in their jobs -- a full-time annual income of $18,800, assuming a full-time (40 hour week), 52-week work schedule -- the income that marks the federal poverty line for a family of four.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0130.3
These are folks making somewhere around the minimum wage ($5.15 an hour for nontipped workers, and $2.13 an hour for tipped workers).

that's less than $180 a day increase in payroll (taking SS out of the employer equation for simplicity).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0133.5
An average Mcdonalds serves over 1500 people a day.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0133.6

People working for minimum wage are producing a large number of product or service.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0133.9
The extra cost is diluted by the large numbers of those paying for each unit.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0133.10
Many of the products minimum wage workers produce are items they wouldn't even able to afford if they made a couple dollars an hour more.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0133.11
So the cost going up for those items wouldn't even effect them.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0133.12
If I'm producing blouses that cost $50 each, I'm not going to be able to afford them whether I make $5.50 hr or $7.50.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6815804_0133.13

My understanding is that a person seeking the services of a fertility clinic signs a contract stipulating that the clinic will store all surplus embryos as long as the client pays the storage fee.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0010.3
If the client stops paying, which frequently happens, the clinic, after a diligent search for the client, can discard the embryos.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0010.4
In actual practise, the clinics tend to keep the embryos on ice because they fear law suits.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0010.5
This is an area not tested in the courts.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0010.6
I doubt that the religious people would be satisfied with a law casting the medical use of an embryo as an organ donation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0010.7
Their point is that the embryo is a human being and is therefore subject to all the rights and protections of the constitution.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0010.8
In their view, there is a difference between an embryo and a brain dead person.

boomerang, I am all for stem cell research, I am extremely happy that we voted for it here in California on Novemebr 2, I am so proud of my fellow Californians.

The fundamentalists are fanatical, in my opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0012.1
I had a chance to do a little reading on the subject yesterday.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0012.2
It seems that many embryos are donated from fertility labs for research.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0012.3
Finding out what kind of research was a different matter altogether - I couldn't find anything on it -- yet.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0012.4
There are apparently several options - keep them frozen (in which future viability of the embryo is not a given), disposal (by a variety of methods), donation (for research or adoption) and take-home (for god knows what).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0012.5
I can understand why many clinics are afraid of lawsuits.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0012.6
It certainly does present some ethical problems.

I come from a line of people who are very pragmatic about dying.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0012.9
I've argued before (to the outrage of some) that we should always assume people want to donate their organs and make them sign something if they DON'T want to.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0012.10
My father did a whole body donation when he died -- too late to help him, maybe not too late to help others.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0012.11
I suppose that is one of the reasons I see this whole stem cell thing as so weird.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0012.12

That is one investment that will most certainly pay off.

I am also a Californian who voted in favor of Proposition 71.

All politics aside, it was THE most important issue on the ballot as far as I was concerned.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0013.3
Like dare2think, I am also incredibly proud of my fellow Californians that supported this measure.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0013.4
I am also proud of our governor, being a Republican, coming out in strong support of Stem Cell research, even when it goes against the grain of his political party for the most part He is at least smart enough to see that the few lines granted by the Federal government are not nearly enough.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0013.5
Boomerang, I love your concept of treating the frozen embryos as transplantable, viable options.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0013.6
It wasn't long ago, my daughter and I were talking about this same subject and I mentioned to her that I would create a ton of test tube blastocysts to donate to stem cell research if I knew that it was allowed.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0014.3
I think Californias might have shown that there is a lot of support for this research.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0014.4
I know that there is no way to ever convince everyone about stem cell research but I think this is a good argument that I haven't really heard.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0014.5
It might persuade a few people to rethink their position.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0014.6
One of the big stumbling blocks might be that people who do have to use fertility clinics don't take their fertility for granted which makes this "offspring" a bit more problematic emotionally.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0014.7
It would be interesting to hear from anyone who had undergone IVF and from anyone in the anti-stem cell research camp.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0014.8
I thought about taking Phoneix's advice and turning my thoughts into a letter to the editor or a "My Turn" essay for Newsweek or something but the more I read the more I realized that the amount of research required is beyond me.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0014.9
However, I might try to find someone with the means and skills to investigate the position because I do think it has merit.

Some states, such as California and New Jersey, have set aside funds for research in this area.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6818574_0084.8
Additionally, it is interesting, if not just anecdotal, to see people, such as the Reagans, come out in favor of this research once their life experience provides a view through a somewhat different lense.

This question may have been done before, but I can't remember, so here it is (possibly again)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.3
I'm curious to see how far back people can remember, and to what degree of accuracy.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.4
I'll give an example:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.5
I remember events back to when I was two years old, but after speaking to my relatives who were there at the time, I find that the images and events which I remember are only only partially correct.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.6
My sister is two years younger than I am, and I remember the day she came home from the hospital.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.7
We were living in the house in New Jersay, and Mom and I were standing in the hallway watching as a car drove up and my grandmother got out carrying my new sister.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.8
I jumped up and down and asked mom if I could hold the baby, and my mom said ok, but she told me to sit on the couch first (but I was too excited to sit, so I jumped up and down on the couch instead
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.11
I can see these events in my mind, but they are not all correct.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.12
For one thing, we were living in Alabama at the time, so the house and hallway were totally wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.13
And of course, it wasn't my grandmother who drove home with my sister, it was my mother.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.14
And the lady in the hallway with me was my grandmother, not my mother.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.15
However, grandmom says that we did stand in the hallway and watch the car drive up, and I did ask to hold her, and she did send me to the couch, and I did jump around rather than sit.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.16
And it was the old white couch we had back when I was two, with the texture I remember, and which we threw away before I was three.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.17
We know the date this happened, because we know when Mom and Sister came home from the hospital, so I was two years and two months old at the time.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.18
Forty years later, I find in hindsight, that my memory is clear, but inaccurate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.19
I cannot remember any events before this time.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.20
Does anyone else's memory go back before two years and two months?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0001.21
And if so, do you have any measure of how accurate those memories are?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0002.1
good one...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0002.2
I am not sure (will check with father tomorrow if he remembers) but I believe that my first memory dates from approx.

same time as yours.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0002.4
I was around two years old when they woke me up late at night, and mom took me in her arms and we went to living room where was my dad with blue bag in which was puppy...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0002.5
my first dog.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0002.6
I remember all of furniture details, but that is not so important, because I lived in this house until I was 6, so this memories may be mixed with memories from later...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0002.7
I remember however how my dad was dressed (can't remember about mom, I am just guessing, and probably it's a good guess, but still just a guess), I remember that I was sitting on a couch and I remember that my dad asked me what name we will give to dog...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0002.8
I also have memory (but this one is not that clear) about my dad and me walking on completely frozen river that is near that house - that happened last time January 1977th (last time that river was so frozen that you could walk on it), when I was 23 months old.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0002.9
But this memory is blurred, I can't recall any details, I just remember that I was with my dad, and that river was frozen and that there were lot of people
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0003.1
I was in the high chair so I was maybe 2 or 3, and eating Life cereal with milk (my mother was feeding me).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0003.2
I finished the cereal but not the milk so she poured it into a red plastic cup and gave it to me to drink.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0003.3
I saw the bits of cereal floating around in the milk and threw the glass across the kitchen.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0003.4
I also remember the carpeting in that house, as light blue, though my mother says it was light green.

Lots of "memories" we think we have from a long time ago are very inaccurate - I was doing some research into this recently and found it fascinating.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0006.2
Anyway - the earliest memory I THINK I have was when I was still in nappies.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0006.3
It is dark - and I am lying on the floor - living room, I think - and I am terrified - I can see a huge, strange, person hulking above me (details very unclear - blurred - by tears?)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0006.4
- she is trying to change my nappy, and I am TERRIFIED!!!!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0006.5
Screaming and such - thankfully, my familiar sister intervenes - I think my eyes are closed by then, she is just a familiar presence, and I calm down.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0006.6
I am sure it was our very normal sized baby sitter, Miss Martyn, from a 2 year old perspective.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0006.7

Things are so BIG and strange.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0006.9
It makes me think it may be a true memory - it is so unlike older memories - very accurate from a wee person's perspective.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0023.1
One thing I think I've read is that we tend to actually remember the last telling, or proecessing, of a memory.

I've been asking the sozlet if she remembers when she was in my tummy since she was tiny, and she's told me things, but who knows.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0023.3

bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0025.1
I think my earliest memory was somewhere between 3 and 4 years old.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0025.2
In VERY vivid detail I remember falling down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0025.3
The funny thing is, I don't remember what caused me to fall.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0025.4
I just remember tumbling down.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0025.5
I kept my eyes open, and clearly watched the view go from the handrail, to stairs, to cieling, then wall, then finally to ceiling.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0025.6
I stayed on the floor for a few moments, looking up at the cieling, no tears ( as I wasn't really hurt, just surprised, and no one was near me, so drama would have been pointless
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0025.8
, and thats where the memory ends.

I remember being absolutely terrified on the flight, but kept deathly still.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.5
I just knew that something horrible would happen if I made a peep.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.6
But after the flight landed I howled to high heavens.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.7
Then, weeks later, we drove back in a car without AC.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.8
We were on a highway paralleling a river (must have been either in North Dakota or eastern Montana) and we were all ready to melt.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.9
We came across a stand, north of the road and closer to the river, selling iced watermellon in the shade of big trees.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.10
We stopped, ate a bunch of watermellon, and cooled off before continuing the drive.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.11
There are a few other early memories, but I can't date them.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.12
I remember my mother rocking me, trying to get me to fall asleep, while singing the Brahm's Lullaby to me.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.13
She thought she had succeeded, but I was still wide awake, though with my eyes closed.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.14
She stopped singing and rocking, thinking to put me to bed/crib(?), but the instant she did my eyes went wide open, and I demanded "la la!"
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.16
A final memory.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.17
I don't know how old I was, but I do remember I couldn't talk yet.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.18
I was sitting in a high chair, and my sister (seven years my senior) walked by. As she did I very deliberately grabbed as much of her hair as I could, and yanked.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.19
She screamed, and said I did it on purpose (of course I did).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0028.20
But our parents said "oh no, it was an accident".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0029.1
My earliest memory is being in preschool, 2 years old, and knowing how to read, since I learned pretty early.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0029.2
The teacher was a bit surprised.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0029.3
That made for an awkward time in my first year of preschool, I believe.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0029.4
It was a while before my parents even knew that I could read.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0030.1
So, who taught you how to read?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0031.1
TV, seriously.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0031.2
Sesame Street.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0031.3
EDIT: Rather, Sesame Street is what taught me how to read.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0032.1
Coulda been worse.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0032.3
My first TV memory was Dodo The Kid from Outer Space (B&W).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0032.4
Given that I'm a sci-fi fan, and love science, I wonder if that early TV show set the course for my life...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6820809_0032.5
I'll never know.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.1
Yikes, this one might get me in trouble.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.2
I, as you can see by my avatar, I am a stereotypical white man.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.3
I would like to think I exercise no racist beliefs, but that's not true.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.4
When hiring sales people; I hire the most qualified applicants, but; I assume in advance that the black applicants are not likely to perform as well as their equally qualified white counterparts.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.5
Black applicants with ethnic sounding names or speech are far less likely to meet quota.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.6
I've measured the performance of hundreds of sales persons, while selling tens of thousands of products.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.7
As a capitalist, my aspiration is to make as much money as possible.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.8
The best person for the job, is the one that is most profitable to employ.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.9
Perhaps the white majority in America is less likely to buy from blacks.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.10
Perhaps the blacks I've hired lacked the social skills to match their white counterparts performance.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.11
Perhaps blacks don't try to sell as hard as whites (this one I know is false).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.12
Perhaps I'm a closet racist who lies about the observed results in order to justify my racism (also false).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.13
Regardless of the reason, the results remain the same.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.14
I've heard of Sales managers who automatically: "If the first name ryhmes with honda, the application goes in the circular file."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.15
Unfair?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.16
Certainly.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.17
Ecconomically sound?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.18
Probably.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.19
Racially biased?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.20
Definitely.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.21
Sales 'Leads" can be tremendously expensive to generate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.22
A closing ratio variation of 1% is enormous!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.23
My companies profit margin is frequently less than 1%.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.24
Conclusion: Ecconomic resposibility sometimes overrides my desire to be racially blind.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.25
The ugly truth is that this fiscal reality does help propetuate Noah's claims.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.26
So, people with African ancestors have a bit of a dissadvantage when looking for work...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.27
So what.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.28
So do fat people.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.29
So do ugly people.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.30
So do intellectually challanged people.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.31
Depending on where you are; an accent from New York or Georgia will put you at a disadvantage.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.32
Young people, old people, tall people, short people are all disadvantaged as well.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.33
It is my contention that every single person is an individual.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.34
We all have our crosses to carry.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.35
I've read about people with Down Syndrome gratuating college.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.36
The person most responsible for success or failure, in this country at least, is the person you look at in the mirror.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0042.37
Am I a racist?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0043.1
Yuuucckkk,
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0043.2
Noah, you and I will probably agree about Bill's views.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0043.3
Fortunately Bill does not represent the ideas held by most white people.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0043.4
Bill may be the "stereotype", but most White people are ashamed of this viewpoint.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0043.5
What is ironic is that you and Bill are not that far apart.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0043.6
You both make assumptions based on race and you are both rationalizing your own particular form of racism.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0044.1
You have confused me, Noah -
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0044.2
"Thus, when the stress returns, the rational assumption of black intellectual and behavioral genetic inferiority will give whites in the future the pretext for committing over acts of discrimination as they once did in the past.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0044.3
For when things get tough for humans, they tend to regress back to old visceral tendencies and behaviors that worked in the past."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0044.4
You appear to posit that racism is "rational" AND that it is a "visceral tendency".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0044.5
How can it be rational?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0044.6
Are you arguing that it is so because it is congruent with certain underlying beliefs?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0044.7
- I would say then, that, at best, it is logical.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0044.8
(And that with a very narrow definition of logic) Rationality to me implies a higher level demand - ie that the premises upon which one bases one's thinking are subjected to rigorous scrutiny.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0044.9
The premises upon which you assume racism to lie do not stand up to such scrutiny - therefore I cannot see racism as rational.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0044.10
When you come to the visceral, I am more likely to be with you - I would not deny that I am racist to some degree, since so many of the unthinking assumptions that I was brought up with were racist - not overtly, but there nonetheless.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0044.11
These are hard to extirpate absolutely, no?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0044.12
And not just for whites - many cultures are racist.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0044.13
However, I use rationality as well as feeling ( I THINK anger at injustice is a feeling, rather than a thought?)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0044.14
to overcome unconscious racism.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.1
Hmm...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.2
I'll tread the waters here...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.3
guess what.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.4
We are all racist, and most of us just trying to grab a piece of the pie, controlled by a very small group of extremely rich people who may even being subtly trying to polarize us all, in order to keep us fighting, should you buy into a bit of conspiracy theory.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.5
Bottom line is, we are all human beings, and it is up to every individual to make their lives work for them.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.6
I don't give a flying crap what race anyone is, even in hiring, as long as they are qualified to do the job.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.7
How many popular racist perceptions within the Black community do you want to get into?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.8
Africans work harder than Jamaicans, and are less likely to get into bad situations with drugs and gangs....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.9
Trindidadian Blacks are better than the more poor Tobago Blacks, what the hell?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.10
I know plenty of people of every race who live way better than I do.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.11
Oh, does that make ME racist?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.12
Will you assume that I'm jealous at a non-white usurping my "rightful" place in the world?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.13
Please...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.14
get over it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.15
We all fight for the same goals.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.16
If we could learn to understand each other better, that would be much more helpful than ruminating about how whites naturally tend towards racism.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0045.17
Incidentally, those weren't my ancestors.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0156.1
Well, if you don't like it Noah, why don't you just go back to Africa!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0156.3
How's that for racism?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0156.4
Oh wait....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0156.5
that was Halle Selassie's idea....
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0156.6
The 'other option' you might be seeking would be actually making an effort to understand others, and refuse to accept that one person is inferior to another, despite what you see.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0156.7
You use empirical observation to judge the world at large in 'believing' in 'white supremacy'.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0156.8
This isn't the case.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0156.9
Just by your thesis, you have already implied that you judge yourself as inferior, if you are indeed Black, thus perpetuating not only self-hatred, but hatred of whites.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.1
One of the things in this hare-brained rant that really gripes me, as those who know me will immediately understand, is the perversion of history.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.2
The subject is far, far more complex and detailed than the simplistic burro-shit offered here.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.3
"White people" did not at any time set out to militarily and economically dominate and repress "people of color."
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.4
Nascent nationalism lead the Portuguese, the Dutch, the Spanish, the English, the French and the Germans to colonize other parts of the world (in roughly that order) for reasons of economic opportunity in the beginning, and for reasons of national prestige at the height of the 19th century colonization frenzy.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.5
The slave trade in Africa began long, long before Europeans ever bought a single slave on the Guinea coast.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.6
It was promoted by Muslims, and Muslim Africans made a good living from waging war on their less sophisticated tribal brothers in order to capture people for sale.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.7
The Dutch were the first Europeans to go into the slave trade in a big way, because of a market in what is now Brazil, and later a market in the West Indies.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.8
In 1609, a Dutch captain made port in Jamestown, and sold African slaves to the English there in order to buy provisions for his ship.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.9
It is certainly true that a perversion of Christianity was necessary to make the upright, "good Christian" reconciled to keeping slaves.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.10
That is a far cry from the implicit suggestion that a concept of white supremacy is endemic in European cultures.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.11
In a rather long post on another thread, I ran down the reasons for the acquisition of most of the territories which eventually constituted the British Empire.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.12
In none of the European colonial empires was any racial concept the motivating factor for the marshaling of national resources to imperial ends.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.13
For the Dutch, their more than eighty year war of independence made successful, lucrative overseas trade a necessity of survival.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.14
For the English, their paranoia about a dominant continental power made them obsessive about maintaining overseas trade, and a large, effective Navy which could protect that trade.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.15
The Portugese had simply traded down the African coast, around the Cape of Good hope, and up the east coast of Africa to the Persian Gulf.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.16
Eventually, they found their way as far east as China.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.17
Profit was their motive, much as it was for individuals in Holland and England, who were able to interest their respective governments in the benefits of promoting trade.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.18
For the French and the Germans, colonial empires were efforts in nationalistic pride.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.19
There are a great many very fertile grounds for speculative research on why the Europeans started largely in last place 1500 years ago, and ran to the head of the human pack in technological development in the last millennium.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.20
For whatever one may contend the reasons are, a belief in white supremacy is an obviously spurious candidate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.21
The mercantile classes who encouraged their governments (largely the Dutch and English-the Portugese never really sought empire, and the Spanish were terrible at the exercise) to promote their overseas capitalistic ventures were motivated by reasons of personal gain-if one wished to call it greed or venality, so be it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.22
To call it in effect institutional racism, is to put the historical cart before the horse.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.23
Theories of white supremacy have been cooked up after the fact of slavery and African conquest.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.24
"The White Man's Burden" is a nineteenth century concept, and was no part of the thinking of Prince John the Navigator, Ferdinand and Isabella, the Dutch Estates or the Parliament.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.25
If you want to peddle this hogwash to the public, you should choose a place where the readers are sufficiently ignorant of history to buy your claptrap.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.26
It won't work here.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0157.27
All of that being said, i would just like to comment that many of my best friends are human beans, although i'm not so sure i'd want my daughter to marry one.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0158.1
Again more filibustering arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0158.2
If the problems of a people that result in lagging outcome relative to other peoples are NOT rooted in EXTERNAL phenomenon, then WHAT is the other option?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0158.3
If the social and economic gaps between blacks and whites in this nation and world are not due to external factors such as slavery, colonization, Jim Crow, exploitation, degradation for centuries that what is the root of these gaps?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0158.4
Furthermore, it is a law of nature that every action creates a reaction and that the present is created from the past.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0158.5
Thus, what has been the reaction upon blacks from years of subjugation; exploitation and manipulation at the hands of white society and what impact has the past 400 years inherit upon the present?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0158.6
Also, it is not about INTENT...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0158.7
it is about Effect.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0158.8
Who cares what the INTENT of the European explorers were...
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0158.9
this is about the EFFECT.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0159.1
Don't deal well with the truth, huh?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0159.2
You state, without support, as a categorical thesis from authority, that most white people believe in white supremacy, and that this is evident from the history of European colonization and exploitation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0159.3
When it is shown that the thesis is not supported by the historical record, you now start ranting about intent v. effect.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192772-6822537_0159.4

Thanks!
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0002.1
1 bushel (U.S.) = 4 pecks = 32 quarts (dry) = 2,150.42 cubic inches · 1 barrel (standard, non-cranberry) = 7,056 cubic inches · 1 stone = 14 pounds · 1 hand = 4 inches
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0002.2

Thank you, markr.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0003.2
So I guess if someone loves you a bushel and a peck they love you five pecks worth.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0003.3
I've always assumed that "bolt" refered to length - a bolt of fabric being a certain lenght regardless of it's width.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0003.4
I suppose in fabric terms that bolt is an arbitrary measurement.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0003.5
Since you really seem to know what you're talking about but that you fail to mention a "peep" I'm going to guess that it was chosen because it rhymes with "sleep".
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0004.1
I got this out of an almanac.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0004.2
Peep wasn't listed.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0004.3
Also, there are other sizes for barrels: · oil = 42 gallons · liquid = 7276.5 cubic inches · The one I listed previously was dry.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0004.4
For some reason, the almanac had bolt listed in the area section.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0004.5
I also have a book called a Pocket Ref.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0004.6
It lists other odd units.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0004.7
1 firkin = 9 gallons · 1 butt (Brit) = 2 hogsheads (Brit) = 126 gallons (U.S.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0005.1
A firkin and a hogshead?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0005.2
You really have to wonder why those measurements came about.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0005.3
Neither 9 nor 126 gallons seem to make enough sense to require their own word.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0005.4
I wonder if perhaps a "cask" held one of those amounts.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0006.1
firkin (fir) [1] · a traditional unit of volume equal to 1/4 barrel or 1/2 kilderkin.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0006.2
Since barrels are of various sizes, the capacity of a firkin varies.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0006.3
Based on the standard U.S. barrel of 31.5 gallons, a firkin would equal 7.875 gallons, 1.05 cubic feet, or about 29.81 liters.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0006.4
Traditional British barrels and firkins are larger; in the imperial system a firkin holds 1.445 cubic feet or 40.91 liters.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0006.5
The unit is of Dutch origin, and its name is based on the Dutch word vier for four.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0006.6
firkin (fir) [2] · a traditional unit of weight for butter and soap, equal to 4 stone or 56 pounds (about 25.40 kilograms).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0007.1
I also found "pip" and "pipa" (which is Portugese, so I suppose it might be pronounced "peep-a").
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0007.2
pip · the smallest measured change in a currency conversion rate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0007.3
This depends on the relative values of the two currency units: in converting euros to U.S. dollars, for example, a pip is 0.0001, but in converting U.S. dollars to Japanese yen a pip is 0.01.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0007.4
This unit is also called a tick [2].
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0007.5
pipa · a traditional Portuguese unit of liquid volume, originally very similar in size to the English pipe (see next entry).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0007.6
The pipa has become a metric unit equal to exactly 500 liters, which is 0.5 cubic meter, 132.085 U.S. gallons, or 109.996 British imperial gallons.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0007.7
pipe · like the butt, the pipe is a traditional unit of liquid volume generally equal to 2 hogsheads.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0007.8
In the U.S., this means a pipe equals 126 U.S.gallons, about 16.844 cubic feet or 476.96 liters.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0007.9
In Britain it's more complicated, because traditional British hogsheads were of different sizes depending on what they contained.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6921455_0007.10

But this premise assumes that life as we know it is the only form of life that *can* exist.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0006.3
And I disagree with this assumption.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0006.4
The life we see around us evolved in this Universe as conditions allowed, so it's not surprising at all that everything fits nicely.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0006.5
Other Universes with different rules would necessarily have life in them which fits that universe.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0006.6
And Universes which are sterile have no life in them to question the fact that they are not there.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0006.7
The really interesting thing to realize is that life evolves in Universes (at least this one) at all.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0006.8
Is the evolution of life in a Universe pure chance, or is it inevitable?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0006.9
In our universe at least, life not only can exist, but does exist.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0006.10
And that means that our Universe is itself, alive, in a very real sense.

Hi BumbleBee,

I'm not so sure we humans, as self aware beings, are alone in this universe.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0008.3
And even if we are, I don't think it makes us any more lofty in status.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0008.4
The fact that consciousness exists at all, seems to speak volumes about the true nature of our Universe.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0008.5
A realization which seems to escape most people, many of whom think that science only reveals a bleak and meaningless reality.

The late Scottish psychiatrist, Ronald Laing, said, "The range of what we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0009.3
And because we fail to notice that we fail to notice, there is little we can do to change, until we notice how failing to notice shapes our thoughts and deeds."

The view of multi-universe is not a theorem but an interpretation.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0010.2
It explains the world as well as a view that a single universe is created by god.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0010.3
But multi-universe could have been created by god, too.

bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0035.1
Hi, · Yes the article is a bit lengthy but as you can imagine it is hard to do justice to this subject in any detail without some length.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0035.2
I like it because I think Davies did a good job of keeping it readable by interested non-specialists without losing the real flavor and content of the subject.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0035.3
Yes the theory's creators had Kalusa in mind.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0035.4
In the 60-70s timeframe it was resurrected in a different way to describe strong force interactions.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0035.5
They envisioned a little elastic string holding the hadrons together.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0035.6
This failed because they couldn't get the real particles to come out of the theory but got super-massive particles, a group many, many times more massive than the ones that we see and another group (at the plank scale) that seemed then (and to many even now) absurd.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0035.7
Quantum chromodynamics was at the same time being invented and with the idea of gluons described strong force interactions nicely, fit with quantum electrodynamics and the weak theory, and allowed the unification of all three particle forces.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0035.8
All that remained left was to add gravity and a "theory of everything" could be contemplated.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0035.9
Two guys, Green and Weinberg, went back to the old "string theory" because it contained a spin 2 particle which they thought might be a model of the graviton and a new string "theory" was begun.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0035.10
For all the hype it has really led nowhere in particular, so "M-theory" has evolved from it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0035.11
That is the theory in a nutshell.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0035.12
I'll answer your other questions as best I can laterclient work calls.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0036.1
If I understand your other questions:
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0036.2
The FRW model of the universe is the basic standard theory.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0036.3
Inflation has been added to it and is now generally considered within the "standard" model but there is enough disagreement on this that the term is usually added to denote uncertainty.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0036.4
For example the hot BB model vs. the inflationary hot BB model, etc.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0036.5
The BB causes an expansion of space and the further objects are separated from each other the faster they are moving away.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0036.6
There would by now be objects (under most interpretations of the BB scenario) that are moving away from us at the speed of light or greater.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0036.7
This is possible because space is not analogous to matter in these theories in that in can exceed the speed of light in its expansion rate.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0036.8
In an inflationary model it exceeds the speed of light by many, many orders of magnitude.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0036.9
Since communication between space-like separated objects is not possible they can be said to be outside the universe (for those objects that have that separation with them).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0036.10
The concept of the "universe" in astronomy is a fluid concept, which is why we often see new terms like the multi-universe; Webster's definition of the universe (for example) is colloquial.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0036.11
Depending upon which analysis of Guth's inflationary model you choose (there are several at least) the only way to keep inflation consistent with all the other physical laws is if the inflation took place in such a way as the separation of parts of the universe that were space like remained space-like forever.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6922046_0036.12
BTW: Space-like separation is a short hand for two objects not within each others light-cone, i.e. for a signal from one to reach the other it would need to travel faster than the speed of light.

Any reccomendations?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0002.5
Safety is first.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0002.6
I don't anticipate that the vessel will get too hot becuase the batch of gas to be burned will be small, so it need not be intended for high-temperature use.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0002.7
We anticipate that the pressure ballpark will be around 250 psi.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0002.8
Let me know if you think I'm way off
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0002.9

bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0003.1
I saw your question when originally posted, but passed it over for lack of an answer.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0003.2
I still cannot anticipate a safe working pressure, but if the capacity is even as low as 10 fl oz, 250 psi would be murderous if the container failed.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0003.3
If you procede with this, definately test it with massive over pressure in a safe container before exposing spectators to it.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0004.1
There are air filter assemblies for pneumatic applications that are rated to 250psi.

Three problems;
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0004.4
1. Max working temperature is 50degC.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0004.5
(Lexan would be higher.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0004.6
2. Polycarbonate doesn't much like being exposed to chemicals.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0004.7
(Lexan is better in this regardbut only a little.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0004.8
3. The failure mode would be rather explosive.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0004.9
(Same with Lexan.)
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0004.10
You would REALLY want it to be overengineered if you plan on spectators.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0005.1
I agree that overengineering and extensive testing are definitely required.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0005.2
Adrian, am I wrong in my understanding that lexan is a trade name for polycarbonate?
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0005.3

bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0006.1
Lexan is Duponts version of polycarbonate.

Basically the same but not exactly.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6926619_0006.3

As far as the NaOH, I believe that much, if not most of the NAOH is made by the chloralkali process.

Its energy intensive but in the US much of it is made by hydropower in and around Niagara Falls.

What to do with the hypochlorite, hmmmm. Its a chlorine source for chloranilines and other chlororganics (also needs power).

This is getting energy intensive, sort of like the Aswaan high dam.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0008.8
It was first created to supply power to a rural power grid.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0008.9
Now, and shortly after the dam was built, much of the power is diverted to make fertilizers to amend the soils around the Nile below the dam because the · Aswan has cut off the annual floods of silt which originally was natures fertilizer.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0008.10
The silt now piles up behind the dam and causes great stresses on the dam walls whhich will have to be mucked out to prevent a major failure.

However, all these "feel good"ublic works projects that governments undertake get to be circular and counter productive after a while.

There are a number of symbiont plant complexes all over the world.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0008.13
Most famous are oil refineries, petrochem and fertilizer plants which are co located.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0008.14
My experience, in dealing with Ti, is the Ti plant is usually co located with a sulfuric acid plant and a sulfur dome from a desulfuring operation in petroleum.

sulfur is usually in an H2S form it gives the crude names like "sour" where,.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0010.2
"Sweet" crude contains less H2S AS far as H2S removal Im only familiar with the Clause process to remove H2S by oxidizing it in the presence of a catalyst (sorry dont remember the catalyst) Then the first oxidation product is SO2.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0010.3
The SO2 is trhen re-reacted with H2S using a copperas catalyst (Fe Ti O3).
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0010.4
this converts the SO2 to elemental sulfur and is just piled up in HUUUge yellow mountains.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0010.5
Theres another process which uses the Na2CO3 and a catalyst to form an HS- and this is oxidized to elemental sulfur.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0010.6
Im not familiar with the alkaline process.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0010.7
There are newer technologies like microfiltration of H2S where the H2S is reacted to form a thiol colloid, and these are micro filtered.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0010.8
I know nothing of this trick, or whether its in production use.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0010.9
Theres also some bio processes where H2S is reacted in bio filters, again, I have no familiarity with this.

As far as CS2 and H2S as reactants.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0010.13
I think these arent considered for sequestering because of dangers in their use
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0010.14
H2S is very dangerous as a toxic gas and I dont think itd be advisable to use an exposed screen like with the NaOH reactions
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0010.15
Also CS2, in air, is quite explosive, so, it too, I think would be rather dangerous to just expose in an air mix.

It is usually reacted in retorts with wood pulp and H2SO4 and Zinc catalyst to make Rayon.
bolt-eng-DF-199-192780-6927555_0010.17
Besides, CO2 is an effective fire surpressant with carbon disulfide, so it impedes reaction(which is necessary in sequestering the CO2)

We can increase our production of solar electricity 20% annually for at least a decade with large subsidies.We need super conducting high tension lines to bring the electricity to customers in less sunny locations before solar can provide 5% of the world's energy needs.
