So when next year's psyllium crop is harvested in March, it may be smaller than the 16,000 metric tons of the past few years -- right at the crest of the psyllium boom.

And the world could experience its first psyllium shortage.

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega may have accomplished over the weekend what his U.S. antagonists have failed to do: revive a constituency for the Contra rebels.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.2
Lawmakers haven't publicly raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the Contras, and President Bush parried the question at a news conference here Saturday, saying only that "if there's an all-out military offensive, that's going to change the equation 180 degrees."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.3
But Mr. Ortega's threat over the weekend to end a 19-month cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him, effectively elevated the Contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.4
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said yesterday on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" that Mr. Ortega's threat was "a very unwise move, particularly the timing of it."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.5
The threat came during a two-day celebration in Costa Rica to highlight Central America's progress toward democracy in the region, attended by President Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 14 other Western Hemisphere leaders.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.6
Mr. Bush returned to Washington Saturday night.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.7
Mr. Ortega announced on Friday that he would end the cease-fire this week in response to the periodic Contra assaults against his army.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.8
Saturday, he amended his remarks to say that he would continue to abide by the cease-fire if the U.S. ends its financial support for the Contras.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.9
He asked that the remaining U.S. humanitarian aid be diverted to disarming and demobilizing the rebels.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.10
Not only did Mr. Ortega's comments come in the midst of what was intended as a showcase for the region, it came as Nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned February elections.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.11
Outside observers are gathering in Nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.12
And important U.S. lawmakers must decide at the end of November if the Contras are to receive the rest of the $49 million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the Bush administration in March.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.13
The humanitarian assistance, which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the Nicaraguan border with Honduras, replaced the military aid cut off by Congress in February 1988.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.14
While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month, Mr. Ortega's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.15
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) said yesterday on "Meet the Press": "I would hope after his {Mr. Ortega's} act yesterday or the day before, we'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.16
Sen. Dole also said he hoped for unanimous support for a resolution he plans to offer tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan leader.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.17
While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question, rejected by Congress and de-emphasized by the Bush administration, Mr. Ortega's statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.18
"The administration should now state that if the February election is voided by the Sandinistas . . . they should call for military aid," said former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.19
"In these circumstances, I think they'd win."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.20
Sen. Mitchell said that congressional Democrats intend to honor the March agreement to give non-lethal support to the Contras through the February elections, although he added that the agreement requires that the Contras not initiate any military action.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.21
Mr. Ortega's threat to breach the cease-fire comes as U.S. officials were acknowledging that the Contras have at times violated it themselves.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.22
Secretary of State James Baker, who accompanied President Bush to Costa Rica, told reporters Friday: "I have no reason to deny reports that some Contras ambushed some Sandinista soldiers."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.23
Mr. Baker's assistant for inter-American affairs, Bernard Aronson, while maintaining that the Sandinistas had also broken the cease-fire, acknowledged: "It's never very clear who starts what."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.24
He added that the U.S. has cut off aid to some rebel units when it was determined that those units broke the cease-fire.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.25
In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending Contra aid, Mr. Ortega's remarks also played to the suspicions of some U.S. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the February elections.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.26
Administration officials traveling with President Bush in Costa Rica interpreted Mr. Ortega's wavering as a sign that he isn't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.27
Mr. Abrams said that Mr. Ortega is seeking to demobilize the Contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0177_2006_0331.28
"My sense is what they have in mind is an excuse for clamping down on campaigning" by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency, he said.

A frozen mountaintop in Tibet may offer an important clue about whether the Earth is warming perilously.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.2
Researchers at Ohio State University and Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology in China have analyzed samples of glacial ice in Tibet and say temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over the past half-century than in any similar period in the past 10,000 years.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.3
The ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the Earth has warmed considerably in recent times, largely because of pollutants in the air, and will warm far more in the century ahead.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.4
A substantial warming would melt some of the Earth's polar ice caps, raising the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.5
"If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past, you have much more confidence in predictions for the future," said Lonnie Thompson, a research scientist at Ohio State who dug for and analyzed the ice samples.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.6
To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years, researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.7
These measurements can indicate temperature changes, researchers said, because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.8
Analysis of ice from the Dunde ice cap, a glacial plateau in Tibet 17,000 feet above sea level, show that average temperatures were higher in 1937-87 than in any other 50-year period since before the last Ice Age, Mr. Thompson said.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.9
Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans, which moderate temperature changes.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.10
But the ice-core samples aren't definitive proof that the so-called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating, Mr. Thompson acknowledged.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.11
According to greenhouse theories, increased carbon dioxide emissions, largely caused by burning of fossil fuels, will cause the Earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from escaping into space.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.12
Skeptics say that if that's the case, temperatures should have risen fairly uniformly over the past century, reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.13
Instead, the Dunde ice-core record shows increasing temperatures from 1900 through the early 1950s, decreasing temperatures from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s, then higher temperatures again through last year.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.14
Other temperature data show similar unexplained swings.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.15
"Climate varies drastically due to natural causes," said Mr. Thompson.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0178_2006_0331.16
But he said ice samples from Peru, Greenland and Antarctica all show substantial signs of warming.

An enormous turtle has succeeded where the government has failed: He has made speaking Filipino respectable.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.2
The 6 1/2-foot-tall turtle, Pong Pagong, is a character who stars in the children's television show "Batibot."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.3
He speaks only in Filipino.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.4
"Batibot," which started in 1983 as a hybrid of the U.S. program "Sesame Street," has developed into a distinctly Philippine effort.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.5
Radio programs and books have followed the daily television show.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.6
In the process, "Batibot," an archaic Filipino word meaning "strong" or "enduring," has become a powerful advocate of the use of the Filipino language.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.7
"It impresses on ordinary, young Filipinos that there's nothing to feel inferior about in using their own language," says Randy David, a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.8
"When we started the program six years ago, the use of Filipino was deemed unwise by the predominantly middle class," says Lydia Brown, the program's creator.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.9
Now, she says, "it's no longer an issue."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.10
The success of "Batibot" stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote Filipino as a national language.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.11
Filipino -- once known as Pilipino -- is predominantly Tagalog, the Malay-based language spoken in a part of the country's principal island of Luzon.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.12
Resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country's elite, who generally prefer English.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.13
But while better-off Filipinos are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as English, they are often slow to reveal that they are prejudiced against Filipino, say advocates of the native language.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.14
"For the middle and upper-middle class {Filipino} is declasse," says Bien Lumbera, a Philippine-studies professor at Quezon City's University of the Philippines.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.15
There's also resentment.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.16
Other opponents of Filipino come from non-Tagalog regions.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.17
They argue that their own languages should have equal weight, although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country's population understands Filipino more than any other language.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.18
(There are seven major languages and more than 70 dialects in the country.)
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.19
What tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the Philippines.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.20
It is entrenched in the country's colonial bonds to the U.S., in Philippine class structure, in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.21
As they did when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S., teachers for the most part teach in English, even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.22
As a result, they often speak one language at home, another at school.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.23
Mrs. Brown calls the modern-day cultural ambivalence to Filipino a "language schizophrenia."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.24
The issue has been simmering for years.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.25
It doesn't take much to provoke an intense debate.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.26
When President Corazon Aquino, whose command of Filipino is spotty, announced last year that the language would be used in official communications, there was an uproar from many legislators, who continue to conduct debates mostly in English.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.27
But many proponents of Filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.28
They believe the media, including "Batibot," have played a crucial role.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.29
According to chief scriptwriter Rene Villanueva, "Batibot" doesn't set out to advance the cause of Filipino.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.30
"It's not as if we're teaching language per se," he says, "We're just using it."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.31
These days, "Batibot" is produced in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $3,000 a one-hour segment.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.32
It is shown weekdays on two of the country's five networks.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.33
With an audience totaling more than 400,000, "Batibot" consistently ranks in the country's top-four most-watched daytime programs.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.34
But advertising revenue is inadequate.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.35
Periodically, there are threats that the program will fold.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.36
"Batibot" lacks the polish of "Sesame Street."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.37
Sound stages echo.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.38
Acting sometimes falls flat.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.39
There are only two large puppets in the program: Pong Pagong and a monkey named Kiko Matsing.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.40
But the production is the equal of any local program.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.41
And the show's creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.42
The program isn't afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0179_2006_0331.43
Not that the language war is won, even on "Batibot."

The Canadian government, with a view to becoming more politically active in Latin America, is expected to announce tomorrow its application to join the Organization of American States, a Washington-based regional agency.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0180_2006_0331.2
The expected Canadian move has been welcomed by the Bush administration even though Canada has opposed such U.S. actions as the trade embargo against Cuba, the invasion of Grenada and the military support for Nicaragua's Contra guerrillas.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0180_2006_0331.3
Latin American countries have long urged Canada to join the OAS in the hopes that it would be a counterweight to the U.S., which for many years tended to dominate the 32-nation organization.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0180_2006_0331.4
Even though the U.S. also has supported Canadian membership, it hasn't been a Washington priority.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0180_2006_0331.5
"The fact that we might not side with the Americans may be a reason why Canada's membership in the OAS hasn't been, over the years, an item high on the U.S. agenda," said Allan Gotlieb, former Canadian ambassador to the U.S.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0180_2006_0331.6
The Canadian application is expected to be announced in San Jose, Costa Rica, by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who is attending a centenary celebration of Costa Rican democracy.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0180_2006_0331.7
"Canada has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere," Mr. Mulroney said recently.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0180_2006_0331.8
Some Canadian political commentators have opposed Canada's joining what they see as a U.S.-dominated organization.

"Canada could do plenty of things to get serious about Latin America without running the risk of getting caught in the cross fire" between the U.S. and Latin American members of the OAS, said Jeffrey Simpson, a columnist in Toronto's Globe & Mail newspaper.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0180_2006_0331.10
Canada, at times, could be an awkward OAS partner for the U.S. if its United Nations voting record is an indication.

In U.N. General Assembly votes last year, Canada voted the same as the U.S. only 63% of the time.

Larry Birns, director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a liberal research group, said that Latin American countries would be "profoundly disappointed" if Canada were to follow the U.S. lead in the OAS.

Early this century, diamond mining in the magnificent dunes where the Namib Desert meets the Atlantic Ocean was a day at the beach.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.2
Men would crawl in the sand looking for shiny stones.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.3
It was as easy as collecting sea shells at Malibu.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.4
Men are still combing the beach with shovels and hand brushes, searching for that unusual glint.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.5
But only after a fleet of 336 gargantuan earthmoving vehicles belonging to De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's diamond kingpins, do their work.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.6
Last year, 43 million tons of desert were moved from one dune to another to recover 934,242 carats, which comes to 46 tons of sand per carat, or one-fifth gram.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.7
Oh yes, the Atlantic was also pushed back 300 yards.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.8
"If there's diamonds out there, we'll get to them," says Les Johns, De Beers's engineering manager.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.9
Here, wedged between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world's most inhospitable diamond dig, lies the earth's most precious jewel box.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.10
Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature -- first in the gentle current of the Orange River that carried the stones from South Africa's interior, then in the cold surf of the ocean, and finally in the coarse sands of the desert -- 98% of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.11
While other mines might yield more carats, a higher percentage of them go to industrial use.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.12
Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault, it has been turned into one.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.13
Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908, the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert -- about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic -- a restricted area, a designation normally reserved for military operations.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.14
When the Germans lost World War I, they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer, patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.15
Today, no one gets in or out of the restricted area without De Beers's stingy approval.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.16
The mining zone has thus remained one of the most desolate places in Africa.

Jackals roam the streets at night, and gemsbok, hardy antelope with long straight horns, wander in from the desert to drink from water sprinklers.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.20
On most days, the desert's heat and the cool of the ocean combine to create a mist like a damp rag.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.21
The wind, stinging with sand, never seems to stop.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.22
Still, miners from all parts of Namibia as well as professional staff from De Beers's head offices in South Africa and London keep coming.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.23
And Oranjemund boasts attractions besides diamonds.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.24
There are six video rental shops, three restaurants, one cinema and 34 sports and recreation clubs for everything from cricket to lawn bowling.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.25
The pride of Oranjemund is the 18-hole golf course -- with the largest sand trap in the world.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.26
Last year, when the rising Orange River threatened to swamp the course, the same engineers who are pushing back the Atlantic rushed to build a wall to hold back the flood.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.27
"Nothing is too good for our golf course," says Tony George, a mining engineer.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0181_2006_0331.28
Despite fears the mine may be partially nationalized by the new Namibian government following next month's elections freeing the country from South African control, De Beers engineers are working to extend the mine's productive life for another 25 years, from the current estimate of 10.

Huge machines that look as though they came from the Star Wars desert-battle scene lumber among the dunes.

Mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant anteaters; a whirring ferris wheel-like excavator, with buckets instead of seats, chews through layers of compacted sand; tracks and conveyor belts, shuttling sand to the screening plants, criss-cross the beach.

Then there is the artificial sea wall, 600 yards long and 60 yards thick, jutting into the ocean.

Made of sand, it receives around-the-clock maintenance against the battering waves.

When the mining in front of the wall is complete, it is moved northward.

Despite all these innovations, most of the diamonds are still found in the sand swept away by the men wielding shovels and brushes -- the ignominiously named "bedrock sweepers" who toil in the wake of the excavators.

Laboring in blue and gray overalls, they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out crevices, and not strain their eyes looking for diamonds.

But should they spy one, the company will pay a bonus equal to one-third its value.

For these workers at the bottom of the mine's pay scale, this is usually enough to overcome the temptation to steal -- a crime that could earn them up to 15 years in jail.

Still, employees do occasionally try to smuggle out a gem or two.

The Food and Drug Administration banned all imports of mushrooms from China in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned Chinese mushrooms.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0182_2006_0331.2
"The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in China," an FDA spokesman said yesterday.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0182_2006_0331.3
The agency won't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the U.S. until "satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in China to prevent" bacterial contamination.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0182_2006_0331.4
On May 19, the FDA began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 people in Mississippi, New York and Pennsylvania became ill from eating tainted mushrooms.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0182_2006_0331.5
In subsequent tests, the agency found smaller-size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0182_2006_0331.6
The outbreaks were traced to Staphylococcus aureus, a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0182_2006_0331.7
A recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in early March.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0182_2006_0331.8
In 1987, China exported 65 million pounds of mushrooms, valued at $47 million, to the U.S.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0182_2006_0331.9
The shipments went mostly to food-service distributors that supply pizzerias and restaurants.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0182_2006_0331.10
A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here said that the Beijing government has taken "many effective measures" to stop the mushroom contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0182_2006_0331.11
He predicted the problem will be solved "very soon."

Outside the white-walled headquarters of the so-called Society of Orange Workers, all seems normal in South Africa's abnormal society.

But inside the white walls of the Orange Workers' office -- just about the largest building in town, save for the Dutch Reformed Church and the school -- South Africa's neat racial order is awry.

"If we want to have our own nation, then we must be willing to do all the work ourselves," says Hendrik Verwoerd Jr., son of the former prime minister and the leader of the Orange Workers, founded in 1980.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.12
They do indeed want their own nation.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.13
The pillars of apartheid may be trembling in the rest of South Africa, with Johannesburg opening its public facilities to all races, blacks storming the all-white beaches of the Cape and the government releasing seven leaders of the banned African National Congress.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.14
But here in Morgenzon, a sleepy town amid the corn fields of the eastern Transvaal, the Orange Workers are holding the pillars steady.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.15
The Orange Workers -- who take their name from William of Orange of the Netherlands, a hero of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners -- believe that the solution to South Africa's racial problems isn't the abolition of apartheid, it's the perfection of apartheid -- complete and total separation of the races.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.16
Here, then, is where the Orange Workers have come to make apartheid's last stand.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.17
Their idea is to create a city, first, and then an entire nation -- without blacks.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.18
This may seem to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in Africa.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.19
And the fact that there are only 3,000 card-carrying Orange Workers may put them on the loony fringe.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.20
But their ideal of an Afrikaner homeland, an all-white reserve to be carved out of present-day South Africa, is a mainstream desire of the right-wing, which embraces about one-third of the country's five million whites.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.21
Afrikaner philosophers and theologians have long ruminated on the need for a white homeland.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.22
The Orange Workers are just putting this preaching into practice.

In their quest to perfect apartheid, the Orange Workers have discovered a truth that most of privileged white South Africa tries mightily to deny: The master can't become dependent on the slave and expect to remain master forever.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.34
"If apartheid means you want cheap black labor and all the comforts that go with it, but you also want to exclude the blacks from social and political integration, then these are two contradictions that can't go on forever," says Mr. Verwoerd.

Somewhere, the son sighs, things went terribly wrong with apartheid; today, whites even rely on blacks to police their separation.

"People took separate development as an opportunity to use black labor without ever getting rid of it.

But my father meant it to mean real separation," says the son.

The Orange Workers speak sincerely.

"We agree with world opinion that the status quo in South Africa is morally wrong," says Pieter Bruwer, the Orange Workers' chief scribe and pamphleteer.

"We must either integrate honestly or segregate honestly."

Morgenzon has long been a special domain of Afrikanerdom.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.43
According to Mr. Verwoerd, the early Afrikaner pioneers were the first people to settle in the eastern Transvaal, even before the blacks.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.44
Then, when Morgenzon was incorporated in 1908, the farmer who owned the land stipulated that only whites could reside in town; blacks could work there, but they had to leave at night.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.45
Today, Morgenzon is a town of 800 whites and two paved roads.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.46
Weeds push up through the cracks in the sidewalks, and many houses and storefronts are empty.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.47
There are few factories and no mines.

It was an ideal place for the Orange Workers to start their new nation, unencumbered by the demographics that have undermined apartheid elsewhere in South Africa.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.49
So far, about 150 Orange Workers have moved here, spending nearly $1 million buying up property over the past three years.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.50
Still, complete and total segregation remains elusive.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.51
Just beyond the city limits is a shantytown of 2,000 blacks who are employed throughout the area.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.52
Despite the Orange Workers' intention to put them all out of work, they are in no hurry to leave.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0183_2006_0331.53
A young man called July (that's when he was born), who works at the railroad station just up the street from the Orange Workers office, points at the white walled building and says matter-of-factly, "We're not allowed in there, that's all I know."

The 650-or-so local whites who aren't Orange Workers are more troubled.

Curiously, he compares the Orange Workers to the ANC, which his father outlawed in 1960.

"Likewise, no government will stop this idea of the Afrikaners."

When Maj. Moises Giroldi, the leader of the abortive coup in Panama, was buried, his body bore several gunshot wounds, a cracked skull and broken legs and ribs.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.2
They were the signature of his adversary, Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.3
The rebel officer's slow and painful death, at the headquarters of Panama's Battalion-2000 squad, was personally supervised by Gen. Noriega, says a U.S. official with access to intelligence reports.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.4
Leaping into rages, sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust, Mr. Noriega has put to death some 70 of his troops involved in the coup, according to U.S. officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in Panama City.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.5
He is now changing the place he sleeps every night, sometimes more than once a night.

His meals are most often prepared by women he trusts -- his full-time mistress, Vicky Amado, and her mother, Norma.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.7
And he is collecting the names of those who telephoned the coup-makers to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.8
More enemies to be dealt with.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.9
In the two weeks since the rebellion, which the U.S. hesitantly backed, Mr. Noriega has been at his most brutal-and efficient-in maintaining power.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.10
Yet, while the failed coup is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment, it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.11
America's war on the dictator over the past two years, following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988, is the legacy of that relationship.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.12
Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega, it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama's long history of conspirators and pirates.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.13
For most of the past 30 years, the marriage was one of convenience.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.14
In 1960, for example, when Mr. Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy-in-training for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, he was detained by Lima authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute, according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.15
The woman had nearly died.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.16
But U.S. intelligence, rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy, merely filed the report away.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.17
Mr. Noriega's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to U.S. interests.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.18
From that point on, the U.S. would make a practice of overlooking the Panamanian's misadventures.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.19
The U.S. has befriended and later turned against many dictators, but none quite so resourceful.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.20
The 55-year-old Mr. Noriega isn't as smooth as the shah of Iran, as well-born as Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza, as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti's Baby Doc Duvalier.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.21
Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.22
And out of necessity: the U.S. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power, but a single error on his part could cost him his life.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.23
"The U.S. underestimated Noriega all along," says Ambler Moss, a former Ambassador to Panama.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.24
"He has mastered the art of survival."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.25
In keeping with America's long history of propping up Mr. Noriega, recent U.S. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.26
Mr. Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of Panama's dire economic situation, says Mr. Moss, but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression, and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.27
"If the U.S. had sat back and done nothing, he might not have made it through 1988," Mr. Moss contends.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.28
Perhaps most important, Mr. Noriega's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases, to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.29
One Colombian drug boss, upon hearing in 1987 that Gen. Noriega was negotiating with the U.S. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile, sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name.

"He is cornered," says the Rev. Fernando Guardia, who has led Catholic Church opposition against Noriega.

"The Americans have left him without a way out.

It is easy to fight when you don't have any other option."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.33
His chief advantage in the fight: his intimate knowledge of American ways and weaknesses.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.34
Mr. Noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos, who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.35
The U.S. discovered the young Tony Noriega in late 1959, when he was in his second year at the Chorrillos Military Academy in Lima, according to former U.S. intelligence officials.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.36
The contact occurred through Mr. Noriega's half-brother, a Panamanian diplomat based in Peru named Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.37
Luis Carlos, knowing that helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer, relayed Tony's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and, more important, among his officers and instructors.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.38
A spy was born.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.39
It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built Mr. Noriega, who was known to his friends as Cara la Pina -- pineapple face.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.40
Born the illegitimate son of his father's maid, he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of Panama City.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.41
Tony was four years older than most of his fellow cadets, and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.42
He considered himself intellectually superior to his Peruvian peers, many of whom were wayward sons sent by their well-off families to the highly disciplined, French-modeled academy as a sort of reform school.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.43
In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed, French-made uniform, Noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life, friends from the period say.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.44
"He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism, where officers were the elite with special privileges," recalls Darien Ayala, a fellow student in Peru and a lifelong friend.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.45
Mr. Noriega's relationship to American intelligence agencies became contractual in either 1966 or 1967, intelligence officials say.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.46
His commanding officer at the Chiriqui Province garrison, Major Omar Torrijos, gave him an intriguing assignment: Mr. Noriega would organize the province's first intelligence service.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.47
The spy network would serve two clients: the Panamanian government, by monitoring political opponents in the region, and the U.S., by tracking the growing Communist influence in the unions organized at United Fruit Co.'s banana plantations in Bocas del Toros and Puerto Armuelles.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.48
United Fruit was one of the two largest contributors to Panama's national income.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.49
Satisfying its interests was a priority for any Panamanian leader.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.50
Mr. Noriega's initial retainer was only $50 to $100 a month, plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX, a former intelligence official says.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.51
It was modest pay by American standards, but a healthy boost to his small military salary, which fellow officers remember as having been $300 to $400 monthly.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.52
"He did it very well," recalls Boris Martinez, a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.53
"He started building the files that helped him gain power."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.54
A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City, capital of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.55
By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses, he gained a ready cache of information.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.56
He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk, which had been found with their mistresses.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.57
This proved particularly valuable to the Panamanian government in 1967, when union leaders were planning a May Day march that the government feared could turn violent.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.58
Mr. Noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.59
So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana-exporting city of Puerto Armuelles, which was ruled by United Fruit Co.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.60
The campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.61
"It was like a play on Broadway," recalls Mr. Martinez.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.62
"Noriega managed the whole thing.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.63
He was superb.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.64
Noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.65
During his years in Chiriqui, however, Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.66
Rodrigo Miranda, a local lawyer and human-rights monitor, recalls an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in David, where he had his offices.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.67
Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked, laughing at them and then retreating to his office.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.68
"People started wondering if something was wrong with him," Mr. Miranda recalls.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.69
But through this period, so far as the U.S. military was concerned, Mr. Noriega was a model recruit.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.70
He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July 1967, according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details Mr. Noriega has since classified as secret.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.71
He flew to Fort Bragg, N.C., in September of that year for a course in psychological operations, returning to the School of the Americas in Panama for a two-month course called "military intelligence for officers."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.72
Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty, but they did so falsely.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.73
He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama's so-called G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.74
He became Gen. Torrijos's inseparable shadow, and the holder of all Panama's secrets.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.75
Mr. Noriega, by now a lieutenant colonel, expanded his contacts to include the Cubans -- not to mention the Israelis, the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.76
When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega's moonlighting, intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.77
"Early on in the State Department, we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel, in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States," recalls Francis J. McNeil, who, as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, first ran across reports about Mr. Noriega in 1977.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.78
"Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.79
Even at this early stage, drugs caused additional concerns.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.80
During the Nixon administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2's connections to arrested drug traffickers.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.81
One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col. Noriega, one of which was assassination.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.82
The head of the DEA at the time, John Ingersoll, scotched the assassination plan.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.83
But he did fly to Panama to scold dictator Torrijos on the drug ties of Panamanian officials, including Mr. Noriega.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.84
Mr. Ingersoll later recalled that Gen. Torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the U.S.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.85
"Everybody was afraid of him," Mr. Ingersoll says.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.86
Mr. Noriega became an even greater threat in 1976, when U.S. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the U.S. Army's 470th Military Intelligence Group.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.87
The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. Torrijos's own phone, according to American intelligence officials.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.88
"We caught him with his hands on our cookie jar," says former CIA Director Stansfield Turner.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.89
For the first time, the U.S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense, Mr. Turner says.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.90
"In the world of intelligence, if you want to get information, you get it from seedy characters.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.91
The question is how much you get tied in with seedy characters so they can extort you."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.92
Intelligence officials to this day worry whether Mr. Noriega sold sensitive information on the recordings to the Cubans or others.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.93
Mr. Turner was troubled enough to cancel the U.S. contract with the rent-a-colonel at the beginning of the Carter administration.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.94
The U.S. soon found new cause for concern: gun-running.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.95
Prosecutors in Southern Florida indicted five Panamanians on charges of illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of Mr. Somoza.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.96
They included one of Mr. Noriega's closest friends and business partners, Carlos Wittgreen.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.97
And the investigators were quickly closing in on Mr. Noriega himself.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.98
At the time, though, in 1979, the U.S. was once again flirting with its longtime Latin American spy.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.99
Mr. Noriega made plans to fly to Washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the Pentagon.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.100
Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to fly through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.101
It was a Friday in June.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.102
The Pentagon foiled the plan.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.103
According to military officers at the time, word was passed to Mr. Noriega by his American hosts that the police would be waiting.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.104
On Monday, U.S. officials received a routine, unclassified message from the military group commander in Panama.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.105
"Due to health reasons, Lt. Col. Noriega has elected to postpone his visit to Washington," it read.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.106
Prosecutors in Miami received yet another setback.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.107
Their original indictment against Mr. Wittgreen, the friend of Mr. Noriega, and the other four was dismissed on a technicality.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.108
But now, along with re-indicting Mr. Noriega's pal, they intended to charge Mr. Noriega himself, on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some $2 million in arms.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.109
In January 1980, Jerome Sanford, as assistant U.S. attorney, was summoned to a meeting with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Miami.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.110
Panamanian dictator Torrijos, he was told, had granted the shah of Iran asylum in Panama as a favor to Washington.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.111
Mr. Sanford was told Mr. Noriega's friend, Mr. Wittgreen, would be handling the shah's security.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.112
It wouldn't be a good idea to indict him -- much less Mr. Noriega, the prosecutor was told.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.113
After prodding from Mr. Sanford, U.S. Attorney Jack Eskenazi pleaded with Justice Department officials in Washington to let the indictment proceed.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.114
"Unfortunately," Mr. Eskenazi wrote in a letter, "those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.115
The letter, along with a detailed prosecution memo, sat on the desks of Justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.116
"I think if we had been allowed to go ahead then we wouldn't have the problems we have now," Mr. Sanford says.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.117
"If he had been found guilty, we could have stopped him."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.118
In August 1983, Mr. Noriega took over as General and de-facto dictator of Panama, having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss Omar Torrijos.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.119
Soon, the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.120
The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega's G-2 back on the U.S. payroll.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.121
Payments averaged nearly $200,000 a year from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.122
Although working for U.S. intelligence, Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.123
During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.124
He allegedly entered into Panama's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses, according to Floyd Carlton, a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.125
But Mr. Noriega was convinced the Reagan White House wouldn't act against him, recalls his close ally Jose Blandon, because he had an insurance policy: his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.126
Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.127
Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.128
And on at least one occasion, in the spring of 1985, he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.129
Although his help for the Contra cause was limited, it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration, says Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who then served on the Senate Intelligence Committee.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.130
"Noriega played U.S. intelligence agencies and the U.S. government like a violin," he says.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.131
An incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which Mr. Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington -- by compromising U.S. officials.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.132
Curtin Windsor, then the ambassador to Costa Rica, recalls being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and "quiet, serious conversation" on the Aswara Peninsula.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.133
Mr. Windsor notified Everett E. Briggs, the U.S. ambassador to Panama, of the invitation.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.134
"Briggs screamed," Mr. Windsor recalls.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.135
He says Mr. Briggs told him he was being set up for a "honey trap," in which Mr. Noriega would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event "with sound and video."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.136
Mr. Briggs, on vacation after resigning his position at the National Security Council, couldn't be reached for comment.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.137
As Mr. Noriega's political troubles grew, so did his offers of assistance to the Contras, an apparent attempt to curry more favor in Washington.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.138
For instance, he helped steal the May 1984 Panamanian elections for the ruling party.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.139
But just one month later, he also contributed $100,000 to a Contra leader, according to documents released for Oliver North's criminal trial in Washington, D.C.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.140
Yet, his political setbacks mounted.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.141
Mr. Noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of Hugo Spadafora, his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger Mr. Noriega on drug trafficking charges.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.142
He then ousted President Nicholas Ardito Barletta, a former World Bank official with close ties to the U.S., after Mr. Barletta tried to create a commission to investigate the murder.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.143
And, all the while, Panama's debt problems continued to grow.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.144
Mr. Noriega was growing desperate.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.145
In late 1986, he made an offer he thought the U.S. couldn't refuse.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.146
As recounted in a stipulation that summarized government documents released for the North trial, Mr. Noriega offered to assassinate the Sandinista leadership in exchange "for a promise to help clean up Noriega's image and a commitment to lift the {U.S.} ban on military sales to the Panamanian Defense Forces."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.147
"North," the document went on, referring to Oliver North, "has told Noriega's representative that U.S. law forbade such actions.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.148
The representative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in place in Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things, just as Noriega had helped {the U.S.} the previous year in blowing up a Sandinista arsenal."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.149
Col. North conveyed the request to his superiors and to Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams, who relayed it to Secretary of State George Shultz.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.150
Mr. Noriega's proposal was turned down.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.151
And Mr. Shultz curtly told Mr. Abrams that the general should be told that only he could repair his tarnished image.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.152
The end of the marriage was at hand.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.153
Within weeks the unfolding Iran-Contra scandal took away Mr. Noriega's insurance policy.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.154
The death of CIA Director William Casey and resignation of Oliver North allowed anti-Noriega political forces to gain influence.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.155
Public protests against him were triggered in June 1987 due to charges by Diaz Herrera, his former chief of staff, that Mr. Noriega had stolen the 1984 election and had ordered the killing of Messrs. Spadafora and Torrijos.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.156
Few American officials were willing any longer to defend him.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.157
Lawyers in Miami -- this time working virtually without impediment -- prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in February 1988.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.158
During negotiations with American officials in May 1988 over proposals to drop the U.S. indictments in exchange for his resignation, Mr. Noriega often asked almost plaintively how the Americans, whom he had helped for so many years, could turn against him.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.159
Now, neither side -- the U.S. nor Mr. Noriega -- has an easy out.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.160
President Bush has sworn to bring him to justice.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.161
Mr. Noriega believes he hasn't any alternative but to continue clutching to power.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.162
It is a knock-out battle -- perhaps to the death.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.163
In the end, is Mr. Noriega the political equivalent of Frankenstein's monster, created by a well-intentioned but misguided foreign power?
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.164
Not quite, Sen. Leahy contends.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.165
"For short-term gains, people were willing to put up with him.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.166
That allowed him to get stronger and stronger," he says.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0184_2006_0331.167
"I don't think we created him as much as we fed him, nurtured him and let him grow up to be big and strong."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0185_2006_0331.1
The nations of southern Africa know a lot about managing elephants; their herds are thriving.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0185_2006_0331.2
But the nations of Europe and North America have decided they know better.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0185_2006_0331.3
At this week's U.N. conference in Lausanne, they imposed a global ivory ban that seeks to overturn local policies.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0185_2006_0331.4
A Zimbabwean delegate argued that the ban would "guarantee the extinction of the elephant."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0185_2006_0331.5
Legitimate ranchers, who have an interest in preserving the herds, would go out of business.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0185_2006_0331.6
Poachers would control the underground trade.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0185_2006_0331.7
Many delegates were willing to craft a compromise, but U.S. delegate Constance Harriman and others thundered that down.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0185_2006_0331.8
The Greens from the First World wanted a morality play, not a negotiation.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0185_2006_0331.9
Fortunately, the nations of southern Africa haven't totally surrendered their sovereignty.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0185_2006_0331.10
Five countries announced they would not honor what one Zimbabwean delegate wryly called the "made in Switzerland" solution.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0185_2006_0331.11
In fact, they seemed a mite resentful.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0185_2006_0331.12
The director of Zimbabwe's Wildlife Department described American conservationists as "fat little puppies from urban environments who don't know a thing about Africa."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0185_2006_0331.13
That's not fair; they're not all fat.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.1
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev wants to bring the nation's reformist press back into line, blaming it for contributing to the many problems he faces and even suggesting that one liberal editor resign.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.2
Mr. Gorbachev's comments, made at a meeting with Soviet national editors and media executives Friday, indicate his growing frustration with the nation's mounting problems.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.3
According to people who attended, he didn't advocate an end to glasnost, his policy of openness.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.4
But he made clear that the press should show greater responsibility in its reporting and cut back on criticism of his reforms.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.5
The text of his remarks hasn't been published, and editors say they have no instructions as to whether it will be.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.6
Accounts of previous such meetings with media and other groups have been printed, sometimes after a delay of several days.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.7
Although glasnost has given the government-controlled media here much greater freedom to report and criticize, Mr. Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders still regard newspapers and TV as important propaganda tools they can use at will.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.8
According to participants at the meeting and Soviet journalists who were later briefed by their editors, Mr. Gorbachev blamed the press for fueling a nationwide mood of despondency.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.9
In particular, he complained about some articles this summer that openly discussed the possibility of a coup or civil war in the Soviet Union, and accused the media of fueling panic buying of goods by printing stories about impending shortages.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.10
He singled out the daily Izvestia and the weekly Argumenty i Fakty, and also gave stinging criticism of Yuri Afanasyev, a leading reformist historian who has written articles attacking the Communist Party.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.11
Among other things, Mr. Gorbachev questioned whether Mr. Afanasyev should remain in the party.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.12
The meeting lasted a little under two hours and was attended by most members of the ruling Politburo.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.13
There was no other speaker apart from the Soviet leader, and those attacked weren't given the opportunity to defend themselves.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.14
Mr. Afanasyev, who isn't an editor, didn't attend.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.15
According to participants, Mr. Gorbachev was particularly incensed by an article on the front page of Argumenty i Fakty this month that examined the popularity of members of the Soviet Parliament.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.16
The piece was based on a survey of 1,500 readers' letters and contained some criticism of Mr. Gorbachev himself.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.17
The newspaper wrote that readers assessed his role both positively and negatively.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.18
It said many thanked the Soviet leader for his "self-control, modesty, culture and ability to hear a speaker out."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.19
But others criticized him, "for imposing his opinion on other deputies, giving commentaries to many speeches, holding elections with no choice of candidate, putting pressure on the voting process and maneuvering between the right and left wings" of the Parliament.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.20
All this, the paper quoted readers as saying, "has seriously weakened his authority."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.21
The Soviet leader apparently suggested to Argumenty i Fakty's editor, Vyacheslav Starkov, that he should resign.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.22
The comment, which Mr. Starkov relayed to his staff, has sparked anger and bitterness at the paper.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.23
Mr. Starkov has been summoned to see the Kremlin's ideology chief, Vadim Medvedev, in the near future, and may discover then if he is to be fired.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.24
Izvestia was criticized for a front-page article last Wednesday that took a sharp look at the Parliament's activities.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.25
It attacked the level of a debate on the private-sector cooperative movement, saying "the discussion was more like a riot than a civilized exchange of points of view."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.26
And it questioned the speed with which the Parliament was adopting new legislation, often with a minimum of debate.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.27
Speaking to foreign reporters, Ivan Laptev, Izvestia's editor, sought to play down Mr. Gorbachev's criticism, but he acknowledged that his paper had been singled out.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0186_2006_0331.28
The Parliament yesterday approved legislation that imposes new restrictions on the cooperative movement, enabling local authorities to set ceilings for prices and preventing the "speculative" sale of goods in short supply for prices higher than that charged by the state.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.1
Walter Sisulu and the African National Congress came home yesterday.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.2
After 26 years in prison, Mr. Sisulu, the 77-year-old former secretary-general of the liberation movement, was dropped off at his house by a prison services' van just as the sun was coming up.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.3
At the same time, six ANC colleagues, five of whom were arrested with him in 1963 and sentenced to life imprisonment, were reunited with their families at various places around the country.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.4
And as the graying men returned to their homes, the ANC, outlawed in South Africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government, defiantly returned to the streets of the country's black townships.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.5
A huge ANC flag, with black, green and gold stripes, was hoisted over the rickety gate at Mr. Sisulu's modest house, while on the street out front, boys displayed the ANC colors on their shirts, caps and scarves.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.6
At the small four-room home of Elias Motsoaledi, a leading ANC unionist and a former commander in the group's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, well-wishers stuck little ANC flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in ANC ribbons.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.7
"I am happy to see the spirit of the people," said Mr. Sisulu, looking dapper in a new gray suit.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.8
As the crowd outside his home shouted "ANC, ANC," the old man shot his fists into the air.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.9
"I'm inspired by the mood of the people."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.10
Under the laws of the land, the ANC remains an illegal organization, and its headquarters are still in Lusaka, Zambia.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.11
But the unconditional release of the seven leaders, who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC, is a de facto un-banning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.12
"The government can never put the ANC back into the bottle again," said Cassim Saloojee, a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand to welcome Mr. Sisulu.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.13
"Things have gone too far for the government to stop them now.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.14
There's no turning back."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.15
There was certainly no stopping the tide of ANC emotion last night, when hundreds of people jammed into the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto for what became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.16
Deafening chants of "ANC" and "Umkhonto we Sizwe" shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts, including the armed struggle.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.17
And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela, the ANC's leading figure, who was jailed with them and remains in prison.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.18
Without him, said Mr. Sisulu, the freeing of the others "is only a half-measure."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.19
President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress, a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.20
But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.21
As other repressive governments, particularly Poland and the Soviet Union, have recently discovered, initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult, if not impossible, to control.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.22
As the days go by, the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.23
If it doesn't yield on these matters, and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC, the expectations and promise raised by yesterday's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.24
If it does, the large number of right-wing whites, who oppose any concessions to the black majority, will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.25
The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.26
The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government protests and violence; if it does, Pretoria will use this as a reason to keep Mr. Mandela behind bars.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.27
Pretoria hasn't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place: for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.28
In addition, the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.29
In order to head off any divisions, Mr. Mandela, in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released, instructed them to report to the ANC headquarters in Lusaka as soon as possible.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.30
The men also will be faced with bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country's many militant black youths, the so-called young lions who are anxious to see the old lions in action.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.31
Says Peter Mokaba, president of the South African Youth Congress: "We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the ANC."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.32
They never considered themselves to be anything else.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.33
At last night's rally, they called on their followers to be firm, yet disciplined, in their opposition to apartheid.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.34
"We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very, very sensitive," said Andrew Mlangeni, another early Umkhonto leader who is now 63.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0187_2006_0331.35
"We want to see Nelson Mandela and all our comrades out of prison, and if we aren't disciplined we may not see them here with us."

We don't know who is winning the drug war in Latin America, but we know who's losing it -- the press.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.2
Over the past six months, six journalists have been killed and 10 kidnapped by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas -- who often are one and the same -- in Colombia.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.3
Over the past 12 years, at least 40 journalists have died there.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.4
The attacks have intensified since the Colombian government began cracking down on the traffickers in August, trying to prevent their takeover of the country.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.5
The slaughter in Colombia was very much on the minds of 450 editors and publishers from Latin America, the United States, the Caribbean and Canada attending the 45th general assembly of the Inter-American Press Association in Monterrey, Mexico, this week.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.6
On Tuesday the conference got word of another atrocity, the assassination in Medellin of two employees of El Espectador, Colombia's second-largest newspaper.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.7
The paper's local administrator, Maria Luz Lopez, was shot dead, and her mother wounded, while her car was stopped for a red light.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.8
An hour later, the paper's circulation manager, Miguel Soler, was shot and killed near his home.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.9
The drug lords who claimed responsibility said they would blow up the Bogota newspaper's offices if it continued to distribute in Medellin.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.10
They bombed the Bogota offices last month, destroying its computer and causing $2.5 million in damage.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.11
El Espectador has been a special target because of the extraordinary courage of its publisher and his staff.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.12
At Monterrey, publisher Luis Gabriel Cano, although shaken by the murders, issued a statement saying: "We will not cease our fight against drug trafficking.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.13
They want to terrify the press and in particular El Espectador because it has always been a torchbearer in this war."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.14
This comes from a man whose brother, Guillermo, was murdered in 1986.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.15
The publishers in Monterrey command no battalions, but they agreed to express their outrage with editorials in today's editions.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.16
Many will use a common editorial.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.17
A final statement yesterday said: "While some advances are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere, the state of press freedom in the Americas still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest form of censorship: death by assassination."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.18
The report charged that Panama's Manuel Noriega is not only in league with the drug traffickers but also is bullying the press as never before.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.19
"Noriega has closed every independent newspaper, radio and television station and arrested, tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters," the statement declared.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.20
It added: "In Cuba, public enemy No. 1 of press freedoms in the hemisphere, repression of journalists both Cuban and foreign is worse than ever."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.21
And in Nicaragua, promises of press freedom by the Sandinistas "have not materialized."
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.22
As it happens, the four countries cited, Colombia, Cuba, Panama and Nicaragua, are not only where the press is under greatest attack but also are linked by the drug trade and left-wing politics.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.23
Noriega is close to Castro and may once have been his agent.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.24
Sandinistas Thomas Borge and the Ortega brothers are Castro proteges; he backed their takeover of Nicaragua.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.25
In Colombia, the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19, which Castro has clearly backed.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.26
Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.27
"If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them," he told the Journal's David Asman recently.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.28
The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.29
This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.30
He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.31
Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.32
Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.33
President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.34
It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner, rather than later.
NW_WSJ_ENG_0188_2006_0331.35
After the Panama fiasco, they will need some reassurance.

Certainly, the Colombian press is much in need of that.

One house was destroyed during the strike and casualties have been removed from the area.

A fierce tornado killed 16 people and injured 162 as it swept through Wuwei County in east China's Anhui Province on Tuesday night.

The provincial office of disaster relief said the tornado struck several towns 11:10 p.m. Tuesday and 2 a.m. Wednesday.

Lack of precaution blamed for NW China avalanche accident

NW_XIN_ENG_0191_2005_0405.3
Search for the two missing outdoor tourists in an avalanche in northwestern China's Qinghai Province continued on Tuesday and the tourists' lack of precaution was listed as the main reason of the tragedy, which has already left one dead.
NW_XIN_ENG_0191_2005_0405.4
"The six tourists has no experience of climbing snow-covered mountains and know little about the terrain," said Deng Haiping, head of the provincial mountaineering administration, which is in charge of the rescue operation.
NW_XIN_ENG_0191_2005_0405.5
The six are all members of an outdoor sports club in Xining, Qinghai's provincial capital.
NW_XIN_ENG_0191_2005_0405.6
Two of them climbed such a mountain for the first time, said Lu Shimin, one of the three survivors.
NW_XIN_ENG_0191_2005_0405.7
"They had no compass nor altitude-measuring apparatus, let alone special communication equipment usually used for mountaineering," said Deng.
NW_XIN_ENG_0191_2005_0405.8
In addition, the bold idea of sliding on snow caused the killing avalanche, he said.
NW_XIN_ENG_0191_2005_0405.9
The accident happened Saturday afternoon when the six slided down the 3700-meter-high Daban Mountain at Ertanggou in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County of Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.
NW_XIN_ENG_0191_2005_0405.10
The three survived of the avalanche reported to the police, who then started a rescue operation with the help of villagers.
NW_XIN_ENG_0191_2005_0405.11
One body was found early Sunday morning.
NW_XIN_ENG_0191_2005_0405.12
One of those listed missing is from Hong Kong, but his identity has not been defined, according to the rescue headquarters.
NW_XIN_ENG_0191_2005_0405.13
"He might take his ID card with himself and we only know his name in Mandarin as Hung Zhihua," said Deng, adding local government is trying to find out his identity with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government.

A fifth team of rescuers has been dispatched to search for the missing and more than 140 rescuers are now involved in the operation.

However, rescue work was hampered by thick snow and signs of new avalanche, said Deng.

Cyclone survivors recount Nargis tragedy
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.2
YANGON, May 13
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.3
Some cyclone survivors, who came a hard way from their home disaster-hit regions to seek shelter with their relatives in Yangon in the aftermath, recounted Tuesday their bitter experiences on the recent cyclone storm Nargis that stroke their areas.
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.4
"I experienced the terrible human tragedy," said a survived villager from Laputta, Myanmar's southwestern Ayeyawaddy delta division who escaped death through much hardship from Nargis.
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.5
The survivor, who is a farmer from the Pinzalu village of Laputta lying deep far from the town, said the village stood the hardest- hit one in the township with houses totally collapsed and driven away by a tidal wave of 20-feet (over 6 meters) high caused by the cyclone storm.
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.6
"Carrying my two young daughters, I tried to swim to escape," he said, "One of my daughters died shortly in the violent storm."
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.7
He had no alternative but to abandon the dead daughter in the wave and tried to keep himself afloat for a lengthy time, holding a nearby fallen tree branch.
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.8
After the storm wind stopped for a moment, his another daughter was found dead in his hand, he cried out.
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.9
He went on to recall that as his parents had been swept away by tidal wave at the start of the tragedy, he was left alive alone.
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.10
"Many others in my village were similarly swept away by storm wave," he said, adding that he walked to the Laputta town afterwards, witnessing on the way all houses in villages were under water.
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.11
Finding no drinking water and food in face of hunger, he tried to survive by drinking juice from fallen coconuts.
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.12
Another woman villager told local media that she had to escape by staying on the roof of huts but was striken by falling bamboo in the wind.
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.13
People who could not stand the strike were swept away in the overnight storm.
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.14
"As I walked to Laputta, I saw many people dying on the way," she said, estimating that three-quarter of people in her village have been killed in the storm.
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.15
She went on to describe that "Only five people remained alive in my nearby village Yway Ywa."
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.16
A woman teacher from Yay Wai Ywa village spoke to the local Weekly Eleven News that her village was erased hours after the storm started, adding that the dead were mostly female.
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.17
"The whole village cried in the storm as if the world devastated," she said, "Some family members died together lying on the road in series."
NW_XIN_ENG_0209_2008_0513.18
"I find no relatives in Laputta to depend but to rest on some spoiled pavilion of pagodas with shelter", she exclaimed.

Despite donation of millet gruel by some wellwishers, I had to queue for it, she said.

DF-170-181104-872_4661.2
The 83% disapproval rating is also the worst Gallup has measured in more than 30 years of tracking Congressional Job Performance.
DF-170-181104-872_4661.3
Ever notice that the more gridlock there is, the more Congress' ratings go down.
DF-170-181104-872_4661.4
In other words, Congress should stop all the politcal bickering, put their heads together and start working things out in a real bi-partisan format.
DF-170-181104-872_4661.5
It worked for Reagan and Clinton and look at the positive results.
DF-170-181104-872_4661.6
I'm not the least bit surprised.
DF-170-181104-872_4661.7
I'm still waiting for Pelosi to drain the damned swamp.
DF-170-181104-872_5430.1
Today on the Senate floor Durbin said healthcare premiums WILL NOT GO DOWN and that the Administration needs to quit saying that!!!!
DF-170-181104-872_5430.2
Then Nancy Pelosi in the House said we need to pass the Healthcare Bill so "we can find out what's in it....."
DF-170-181104-872_5430.3
The Democrats are slowy turning Congress into Bozo's Bigtop Circus!!!!!
DF-170-181104-872_5430.4
The insurance industry's own institute said premiums would skyrocket.
DF-170-181104-872_5430.5
How could they not?
DF-170-181104-872_5430.6
If you force them to accept pre-existing conditions and accept other insured's currently not eligible because they cost too much, who is going to pay for that extra risk?
DF-170-181104-872_5430.7
You can't legislate risk away. Of course premiums will rise.
DF-170-181104-872_5430.8
The administration is in campaign mode, willing to say or do anything to get this turd passed.
DF-170-181104-872_5430.9
The joke will be on House Dems who are being promised a bill to "fix" the problems with teh Senate bill.
DF-170-181104-872_5430.10
Anyone who believes that will happen is dreaming.
DF-170-181104-872_5430.11
Obama will hang them out to dry.
DF-170-181104-872_5719.1
1. Ending the war in Iraq
DF-170-181104-872_5719.2
2. Developing American energy independence
DF-170-181104-872_5719.3
3. Universal healthcare for all Americans
DF-170-181104-872_5719.4
Works for me......
DF-170-181104-872_5719.5
Only if that means it is over because we won.
DF-170-181104-872_5719.6
And we will have some very strategically located, large bases to counter Iranian and Russian agression for the next 50 years.
DF-170-181104-872_5719.7

DF-170-181104-872_5719.8
Only if he adopts Hillary's plan of MANDATORY UNIVERSAL PARTICIPATION.
DF-170-181104-872_5719.9
Which means EVERYONE, without exception, PAYS premiums.
DF-170-181104-872_5719.10
Here are the things that should be Obama's top priorities.
DF-170-181104-872_5719.11
#1 Ending the war in Iraq
DF-170-181104-872_5719.12
#2 Bringing us Universal Healthcare
DF-170-181104-872_5719.13
#3 Repealing NAFTA
DF-170-181104-872_5719.14
#4 Repealing The Patriot Act
DF-170-181104-872_5719.15
#5 Repealing Taft-Hartley
DF-170-181104-872_5719.16
#6 Bringing Bush/Cheney up on criminal charges for war crimes. (send them to the Haig!!!)
DF-170-181104-872_5719.17
#7 Fire John Bolton!
DF-170-181104-872_5719.18
#8 Strengthen the FISA act
DF-170-181104-872_5719.19
#9 Abolish The Office Of Homeland Security!
DF-170-181104-872_5719.20
#10 Prosecute John Ashcroft!
DF-170-181104-872_5719.21
what about when my favorite doctor quits because he is not going to take a pay cut?
DF-170-181104-872_5719.22
or just lets the quality of his practice go down the tubes?
DF-170-181104-872_5719.23
also, who is going to goto school for 15 years to be a doctor, with major student loans and only make a sub-par government salary?
DF-170-181104-872_5719.24
i'll tell ya what, if were going to goto school for 15 years, it would be for rocket science or computer engineering or something of that nature so i could easily make an above average salary.
DF-170-181104-872_5719.25
last and most importantly, i never want to see any of my paycheck support some lazy person who does not work because the government pays for them to live their life.
DF-170-181104-872_5895.1
I plan on voting against every single one of these dirtbags that call themselves representatives.
DF-170-181104-872_5895.2
Our congress, be it the house or senate, are a bunch of non-representing representatives.
DF-170-181104-872_5895.3
Its as if the British Red Coats were in charge once again doing whatever is best for themselves irregardless of the consitution.
DF-170-181104-872_5895.4
I say kick them all out of office, and then do it again every election for the next several cycles until they get the hint.
DF-170-181104-872_5895.5
WE ARE NOT HAPPY, WE ARE NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!!
DF-170-181104-872_5895.6
Am I the only one or are some of you feeling like this too?
DF-170-181104-872_5895.7
I'm not a Republican, I'm not a democrat, I AM AN AMERICAN!!!!!
DF-170-181104-872_5895.8
Start respecting my country, my consitution, and our national heritage or get fired/voted out.
DF-170-181104-872_5895.9
Add your 2 cents people.
DF-170-181104-872_5895.10
I'll have a Senator to vote for along with my Representative, and Senator Voinovich is not running in 2010 so I'll luckily have more options to vote for.
DF-170-181104-872_5895.11
So far there are 3 candidates in the race that I'm aware of, and I'm not impressed by any of them.
DF-170-181104-872_5895.12
But hopefully somebody good pops up that I can support.
DF-170-181104-872_5895.13
As far as my Representative goes, I can't wait to vote against him.
DF-170-181104-872_5895.14
I don't vote 'against' anyone.
DF-170-181104-872_5895.15
I vote 'for' the best candidate for the job, regardless of political affiliation (unless, of course, they are un-American, like Libtards and Neocons).
DF-170-181104-872_5895.16
Since none of the incumbents in my district will get my vote, I guess you could say I'm voting 'against' them, but I'm still not comfortable with that term.
DF-170-181104-872_8783.1
Where would McCain be without Sarah?
DF-170-181104-872_8783.2
A lot of us, including myself, have had fun poking, jabbing, making fun of Palin, her lack of knowledge about the Constitution, her appearance on SNL, etc....
DF-170-181104-872_8783.3
but at this late date in the race...
DF-170-181104-872_8783.4
Where would he, (McCain), be if he did not have her as his running mate
DF-170-181104-872_8783.5
IMO.... she is helping him more now, because he is hurting himself, more.
DF-170-181104-872_8783.6
Palin solidified the Republican base for McCain.
DF-170-181104-872_8783.7
She invigorated the far right wingers to actually go out and campaign for McCain, instead of apathetically voting for McCain to spite Obama.
DF-170-181104-872_8783.8
Palin is the real star behind the Republican ticket this year.
DF-170-181104-872_8783.9
If it were anyone else, McCain would not have a shot in hell.
DF-170-181104-872_8783.10
Palin invigorated Obama's campaign, and she is one of the reasons Obama raised $150 million dollars in September.
DF-170-181104-872_8783.11
When I saw her speech at the convention, I immediately sent Obama as much money as I could.
DF-170-181104-872_8803.1
Presidential Candidates: Chuck Baldwin (C) Constitution Party Bob Barr (L) Libertarian McCain (R) Cynthia McKinney (G) Green Ralph Nader (I) Independent Obama (D)
DF-170-181104-872_8803.2
Looks like women have a candidate running for President.
DF-170-181104-872_8803.3
Why aren't women flocking to her?
DF-170-181104-872_8803.4
What's wrong with the Green party?
DF-170-181104-872_8803.5
The woman is a nutjob.
DF-170-181104-872_8803.6
She would make Ralph Nader look like Barack Obama.
DF-170-181104-872_8803.7
Why on earth would women vote for the Green Party just because they have a female candidate?
DF-170-181104-872_8803.8
Sorry, I wouldn't have voted for Hillary, either.
DF-170-181104-872_8803.9
I would vote for Sarah or Condy.
DF-170-181104-872_8803.10
THe Green Party is the party for the libtards who are too crazy even for other libtards.
DF-170-181105-885_0229.1
If the Government provides Health Care, whether spelled out in this bill or not, it will RATION the care.
DF-170-181105-885_0229.2
That is how it works.
DF-170-181105-885_0229.3
The Government can not afford to pay for everything for everyone, even if they took all our money.
DF-170-181105-885_0229.4
And in fact the research that backs up this health care bill out of the House spells it out clearly.
DF-170-181105-885_0229.5
Specifically it identifies the elderly and those under the age of 2 as being less important and so they will be the first to suffer from reduced services.
DF-170-181105-885_0229.6
Knowing that the Government can not efficiently run anything, I can promise it won't end there.
DF-170-181105-885_0229.7
Since all healthcare is rationed, the question for me is do I want those decisions to rest with corporations whose sole reason for existence is to make a profit --- profits which depend upon insuring the healthiest among us, and denying coverage for those whom they may have to pay claims?
DF-170-181105-885_0229.8
Corporations where profits are dependent on NOT providing the services I pay for?
DF-170-181105-885_0229.9
That can at any point in time decide to cancel my policy, leaving me without any coverage at all and no prospects of obtaining coverage on my own?
DF-170-181105-885_0229.10
That spend 1/3 of their revenue in administrative overhead?
DF-170-181110-876_4400.1

Many temperatures have been above what is normal for this time of year.

Is this Winter weather going to be what winters will be like in the future.?

DF-170-181110-876_4400.13
It's snowing, therefore Global Warming
DF-170-181110-876_4412.1
When will it be too late to do anything about global warming?
DF-170-181110-876_4412.2
Have we already guaranteed our doom?
DF-170-181110-876_4412.3
So you are a warmist too ehh?
DF-170-181110-876_4412.4
Sorry to hear.
DF-170-181110-876_4412.5
The facts.... from about 1980 to 1998 we had a 1/3 of a degree warming period.
DF-170-181110-876_4412.6
This started the Man made global warming claim.
DF-170-181110-876_4412.7
Another inconvenient fact for the man made global warming crowd. Since 1998 until today there has been no significant warming.
DF-170-181110-876_4412.8
A further fact. In the early 1900's scientists predicted that over the next 100 years the temperature would go up globally about 1 degree. And that is what it did.
DF-170-181110-876_4412.9
So we had an 18 year trend that saw a rise of 1/3 of a degree world wide. Followed to date by a 14 year period with no appreciable warming. Remind me again how we are all doomed?
DF-170-181110-876_4423.1

Precission of the earths equinox refers to the earth's axis wobble moving in an unconventional way.
DF-170-181110-876_4423.3
Time period event is a 25765 yrs wobble path.
DF-170-181110-876_4423.4
Notice the ice cap weight shifting it is due to earths own inertia and the sun moon alignment.
DF-170-181110-876_4423.5
This vid indicates inertia shifts in ice not to be due to global warming but due to physics of the earth, sun, moon system.
DF-170-181110-876_4423.6
This inertia of the sun earth moon generates potential physical plate movements on earth, ie earthquakes.
DF-170-181110-876_4423.7
Very cool stuff.
DF-170-181110-876_4423.8
So is this because of global warming or is it Bush's fault?
DF-170-181110-876_4423.9
It's a good thing the polar ice cap is shrinking then right?
DF-170-181110-876_4423.10
This seems to explain the record snow fall in Siberia and Alaska.
DF-170-181110-876_4423.11
Nobody as yet really understands why periodically earth undergoes geomagnetic reversal. But the wandering magnetic pole seems to have been happening for the last 200 million years.
DF-170-181110-876_4423.12
Happens regularly, and seems to have little effect on the biosphere as a whole.
DF-170-181110-876_4423.13
No unusual events in the paleo record seem to be associated with magnetic reversals.
DF-170-181110-876_4423.14
but everyone knows that what man makes doesnt count huh?
DF-170-181110-876_4423.15
Not, I suspect, as it relates to magnetic pole shift or drift.
DF-170-181110-876_4423.16

People have no respect for their neighbors and I am talking about Americans here.
DF-170-181110-876_4478.6
If they have no respect for their neighbors or fellow countrymen how can they have respect for themselves?

Its not everybody but a small segment of our society but the question is how small is this segment?

The time of water wars is upon us with the privatization of water resources worldwide by multinational conglomerates who are not accountable to, or suppressible by the local populations they effect, even here in America.

What say you?
DF-170-181110-876_5223.3
'Flow,' a documentary on what the privatization of water really means which was the inspiration for me creating this thread.
DF-170-181110-876_5223.4
It brings to light the insane and completely immoral behavior of water corporations (Nestle, Coke, Pepsi, as well as Suez and Vivendi, and their involvement with the World Bank)...
DF-170-181110-876_5223.5
I am never going to buy another Coke, Pepsi, or Nestle product until...

I am dying of thirst, which is the situation many in the world find themselves in now.
DF-170-181110-876_5223.7
Allowing the privatization of public waters sources is stupid beyond all understanding.
DF-170-181110-876_5223.8
Water is resource of the commonweal and ought never to be allowed to become captured by any private concern.
DF-170-181110-876_5223.9
Right now corporations like Nestles are buying up the world's best springs to make bottled water.
DF-170-181110-876_5223.10
Allowing this to happen is a perfect example of how perverted our governments have become.

DF-170-181110-876_7587.2
How many million people post on youtube?
DF-170-181110-876_7587.3
The first two months there were hundreds of private citizens with their video cams reporting about what was happening in the gulf... showing everyone firsthand eyewitness accounts of the incompetence of BP and the lack of government response.
DF-170-181110-876_7587.4
Now there are none: zero: nobody has posted one single video on youtube about the gulf oil crisi for one month.
DF-170-181110-876_7587.5
This stinks to high heaven.
DF-170-181110-876_7587.6
Don't tell me nobody has posted anything on the gulf crisis for one month: there is a media bl;ackouit going on.
DF-170-181110-876_7587.7
The last time something like this happened that I know of; was the republican convention in New York for the renomination of Bush Jr for a second term in office.
DF-170-181110-876_7587.8
Wouldn't that be a YOUTUBE blackout, then?
DF-170-181110-876_7587.9
I mean, rather than a MEDIA blackout?
DF-170-181110-876_7587.10
gulf oil spill - Google Search = Plenty of coverage about the oil spill still on the media.
DF-170-181110-876_7587.11
That's the point: the oil has not been cleaned up: its sunk below the surface: just like all the true facts have sunk out of sight.
DF-170-181110-876_7587.12
The dispersant they used, Corexit; has destroyed all possibility of cleaning up the oil because it's made the oil sunk below the surface.
DF-170-181110-876_7587.13
BP's use of corexit is a quick way of sweeping the problem under the carpet: idiots who don't see the oil on the surface will assume that there isn't any ecological damage going on.

Instead, the ecological damage to the entire area is now a million times worse than it was when the oil was still on the surface.
DF-170-181110-876_7587.15
The oil beneath the surface: millions and millions of gallons of oil is killing all wildlife, all the fish, all the dolphins, all the crabs, all the shrimp, everything.
DF-170-181110-876_7587.16

DF-170-181110-876_8413.5

Bizarre.
DF-170-181110-876_8413.7
Yes, they have been extrapolating temps for areas where they had no direct measurement. However, as they stated, one should use the NCDC measurements for those areas, if very accurate measurements are desired.
DF-170-181110-876_8413.8
Yet, for all of Watts yapping, none of this changes the fact that the warming continues, and differant agencies have better accuracy in some places than others, depending on the methods used.
DF-170-181110-876_8413.9
Another item concerning Watts.
DF-170-181110-876_8413.10
He is not a meteorologist.

He is a fraud in that department.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.1
Tomorrow, the Employment Situation Report comes out and as usual, there will be idiots claiming the government doesn't count people not receiving unemployment benefits, or that the government isn't counting people who should be counted etc.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.2
So let's discuss.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.3
Question: What exactly do we want to measure and why?
DF-170-181113-874_7974.4
Answer: We want to measure the Labor Market and how it is changing, especially how difficult it is to get a job.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.5
First difficulty is that not everyone can freely participate in the labor market.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.6
There are laws and barriers afffecting groups of people.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.7
While children can work, there are significant restrictions as to field, hours, changing jobs etc.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.8
At approx age 16 the restrictions are gone, almost all jobs are open for full or part time work.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.9
So we ignore anyone under 16.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.10
Next group are prisoners. While some "work" it's not really a labor market system and working or not working are not free choices of entry and exit.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.11
So we ignore prisoners.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.12
Next group are those mentally or physically incapable of working.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.13
While many disabled and those with psychological conditions do work, those who are institutionalized or in long term care (such as a hospice) can't.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.14
So we ignore those in an institution or long term care.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.15
There remains many disabled who can't work but aren't in an institution, but since some can and some can't work, there's no bright line, so we include them all.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.16
Next: Retirees.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.17
Many countries exclude those over the age of 65.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.18
For a country with mandatory retirement, or generous government pensions, that is sensible as almost all those over 65 don't need to work and don't work and including them can distort the picture.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.19
But in the US, there is no mandatory retirement (except in military/police) and retirement benefits are not as generous or universal.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.20
So no maximum age limit for us.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.21
Last, military. For a while, they were counted as employed (1984-1994) but since there's no free exit and it's not a market system, including them just raises the number of employed by a fairly constant level, so it's better to exclude the military.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.22
So we have our population: The Adult Civilian Non-Institutional Population.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.23
How do we divide that up?
DF-170-181113-874_7974.24
The key is to be as objective as possible.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.25
Since we have to use a survey (it's just not possible to do a full count every month), any subjectivity will increase our error, so we have to avoid any possible overlaps or judgement calls.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.26
Let's look at Employed.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.27
Who is employed?
DF-170-181113-874_7974.28
Some have suggested a minimum number of hours worked, but is that a good idea?
DF-170-181113-874_7974.29
Plenty of people voluntarily work few hours, or in a particular week only work a few hours. Should we say they don't really have a job or aren't really working?
DF-170-181113-874_7974.30
That's very subjecive. We don't want to run into cases were someone nomrmally works 40 hours a week, but in the particular week of the survey she only worked 2 hours and counted as unemployed.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.31
So we set a bright line of 1 hour for pay, and also include those as employed people temporarily absent due to brief illness, injury, vacation, strike, bad weather etc.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.32
We can always look at sub groups later.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.33
Unpaid labor.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.34
Some people don't get paid (directly) for work, either charity work or working on a family farm or family business.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.35
Let's not include charity work, because that's not really part of the labor market.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.36
But family business/farm is a different story...the person is either just helping out, (meaning if they don't already have another job they wouldn't take one if they weren't working for family and/or no one would have to be hired in their place) or they are a substantial part of the business preventing them from another job and filling a job slot no one else can take.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.37
So let's set a bright line of 15 hours a week and anyone working without pay on family business farm 15 hours or more a week is employed.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.38
What about someone hired but not yet working?
DF-170-181113-874_7974.39
Many things can happen, so we won't call them employed until they're actually working.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.40
Now for the Unemployed.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.41
In casual usage, this can mean many different things, but what we want is a precise, objective definition.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.42
And what we're looking for is available workers who aren't working.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.43
This has an impact on the labor market..supply over demand.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.44
Some people don't want to work...retirees, housewives/husbands, full time students, and some people on drugs or alcohol or criminals or lazy.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.45
So let's not count anyone who doesn't want a job.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.46
Should we count everyone who says they want a job?
DF-170-181113-874_7974.47
They could be lying.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.48
They could be unable to take a job if offered (meaning they're not available labor).
DF-170-181113-874_7974.49
So what bright line can we set?
DF-170-181113-874_7974.50
If someone is actually looking for work, sending a resume, going to an interview, on the union list, then we can safely assume that they are really available for work.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.51
But if someone isn't DOING anything about a getting a job, then they're not available, anymore than someone who doesn't want to work.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.52
Sure they may still consider themselves "unemployed" and they may sincerely want to work, but since they're not available, since they're not part of the actual supply of labor and can't be hired, we exclude them.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.53
So we have our Employed, we have our Unemployed....this is our Labor Force, our available supply of people who can work or be hired.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.54
Everyone else is Not in the Labor Force.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.55
Since the population tends to grow, for an historical comparison, it's better to look at rates/ratios/percentages to get a clearer picture.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.56
Labor Force Participation Rate: The Labor Force as a percent of the Population.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.57
This can be largely affected by non-economic factors as the increase of women into the labor force in the 60s and 70s showed, but it gives a good look at how much of the population is trying to work.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.58
Employment-Population Ratio: this tells us the percent of the population that's actually working.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.59
Again, non-economic factors play a role but looking at the changes can tell us useful things.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.60
Unemployment rate: Unemployed as a percent of the Labor Force.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.61
This tells us how much of available labor...people willing and able and available to work... is not being used.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.62
This is all economic factors...the percent of people trying and failing to get a job.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.63
Does this give a complete picture of the Labor Market?
DF-170-181113-874_7974.64
Of course not...it's not meant to.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.65
It doesn't tell us types of job, if people are working as much as they want to, people who don't believe they would be successful.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.66
But it tells us what we're looking for: the percent of people who we know for sure cannot get a job.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.67
I think that explains the basics.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.68
I'll be happy to clarify questions or discuss any real issues.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.69
The issue is simple, when 150k jobs are created and you need 250 to maintain...
DF-170-181113-874_7974.70
Yet the UE rate goes down.2% then you have a choice...
DF-170-181113-874_7974.71
You can make believe things are getting better or you can understand that things are getting worse and deal with it.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.72
You chose to make believe.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.73
Neither side expects the other to be consistant.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.74
I remember the libs making this argument during the Reagan years.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.75
Of course, the real cuteness was during the Carter years during the run up to the 1980 election when the military was added to the employed part of the picture.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.76
Presto, 2 million more employed persons and the unemployment rate when down by a substantial fraction.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.77
that got quietly reversed after the election.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.78
What is important here is that unemployment is no longer the short term thing it has usually been.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.79
We have people looking for work who have been looking for three years or more.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.80
We have folks just plain resigning from the work force and don't look any more.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.81
People who four years ago had successful careers.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.82
Even under the regime of 99 week unemployment rather than 26 week, we have large numbers who have gone beyond benefits.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.83
To maintain what?
DF-170-181113-874_7974.84
And does "it" need to be maintained?
DF-170-181113-874_7974.85
Or you can do actual analysis of the data.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.86
"Jobs" comes from the Current Employment Statistics Survey (CES) while Unemployment (and total employment) comes from the Current Population Survey (CPS).
DF-170-181113-874_7974.87
The CES is non-farm payroll employment. It excludes agriculture, the self-employed, unpaid family workers and private employees (private cooks, nannies, maids, etc).
DF-170-181113-874_7974.88
So "jobs" may go up 150K, but total employment goes up 300K.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.89
You can't directly compare 2 measures that measure different things.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.90
Much of the drop in UE has been for the wrong reasons...a decreasing labor force.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.91
That was not the case for the January drop.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.92
At best things have been spotty lately...up and down.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.93
You can't just look at one number or one measure and say "things are good" or "things are bad."
DF-170-181113-874_7974.94
The BEST unit of measure is, I think to determine how many Americans are WORKING.
DF-170-181113-874_7974.95
Instead we get reports on the number of people who SELF REPORTED they aren't working but are looking for work.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.1
To find out all we have to do is ask Bernie Sanders and remember that Obama voted to the left of Sanders while in the Senate.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.2
God help us all if Obama ever got to appoint a liberal inflationist Fed Chairman.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.3
Oh, and we might remember that when their God, Keynes, was asked about the future consequencs of his ultra easy monetary policies he said, don't worry about the future, we'll all be dead.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.4
Bernie Sanders: Another very important issue is with unemployment so high, how can we strengthen the Fed's full-employment mandate[ with inflation] and ensure that it conducts monetary policy to achieve maximum employment? [ through inflation].
DF-170-181113-874_8063.5
In other words the Fed has a number of mandates and one of them is to control inflation.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.6
But one of them also is to pursue policies that lead to full employment.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.7
Is the Fed doing that in an adequate way?
DF-170-181113-874_8063.8
Well I would argue that by definition when you have 16% of people unemployed and underemployed it really is not.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.9
They'd do exactly what they've done since 1913.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.10
Lend out "money" that doesn't exist, charge interest for it, inflate the hell out of the currency and line their pockets in the process.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.11
Then, they'd bankroll endless stupid foreign wars, the socialistic welfare state, massive Ponzi schemes, endless bailouts of states, cities, corporations and foreign nations....
DF-170-181113-874_8063.12
The same thing a conservative Fed would do, and then they'd call it brilliant and give obama the credit.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.13
An NGDP target can fix the unemployment problem without resulting in inflation.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.14
That's a gross misunderstanding of the Keynes quote.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.15
What he's saying isn't, obviously, that we shouldn't care about the long run.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.16
What he's saying is that economists are taking the easy way out only ever considering the long run.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.17
We need not only theories of the long run, but also theories of the short run.
DF-170-181113-874_8063.18
Nobody can "fix the unemployment problem" ....
DF-170-181113-874_8063.19

DF-170-181114-902_4264.3
i think this issue is only valuable for the purposes of supporting commoditization of CO2. that's my explanation for why all of the funded scientists point to the gas and build the anthro argument. i dont see how it is credible in light of more dominant causes.
DF-170-181114-902_4264.4
I'm curious Dante...Dosen't the temp change by about 40 degrees, every year, in the northern and southern hemisphere? Also, with warmer temps and more co2 in the atmosphere, wouldn't the number and variety of plants and trees increase? What ever happened to the rain forest, nuclear meltdown, ozone layer, global cooling, or any of the other iminent catastrophes that will befall us if we don't do something RIGHT NOW!!? The only environmental issue important to envronmentalists is whatever one can generate the most money. At least oil companies get their cash by providing us with something we need. You enviro-whackos get yours by doing absolutely nothing at all, except making life harder for everyone else.
DF-170-181114-902_4264.5
In reality humans contribute about 5% to global worming in terms of CO2 release into the atmosphere. Yes it is true that we are responsible for this number and trying to minimize it in whatever way we can, but humans are not ultimately the source of global worming. It is arrogant of us to think that we can effect the ecosystem of the world in such a drastic way in only 20 years. Science is divided on the issues with scientists in government labs reporting that global warming is an imminent threat caused by humans and only we can save the planet while scientists at universities and private organizations generally suggest that man is not the ultimate cause and in reality contributes little. The IPCC has published documentation and recommendations about global warming at regular intervals and it was not until one of their more recent publications that they completely overturned their previous data showing global warming to be natural in favor of new data that showed global warming to be human caused. The problem is that they used the same relative data set and simply changed the way it is viewed to maximize the human contribution. They have also been known to falsify information to suit their purposes and destroy information that proves them incorrect.
DF-170-181114-902_4264.6
So it would appear that politics drives natural history and our relation to the ecosystem...inherent problems there.
DF-170-181114-902_4264.7
Consider too Rapid Climate Change Events as documented by paleoclimatological data from ice cores drilled out of Antarctica and atmospheric analysis of gas frozen in the ice. This heating process occurs every 22,000 years like clockwork for the past 150,000 years that our records go back. Guess what...it has been just about 22,000 years...fancy that.
DF-170-181114-902_4264.8
Remember in the 80s when the next ice age was around the corner and we were all going to freeze to death?
DF-170-181114-902_4264.9
Very simple. Adapting to a rapidly changing climate is preferable to changing our present habits, no matter how destructive they are to the coming generations, or to the rest of the biosphere.
DF-170-181114-902_4264.10
For most people, the present rapid changes are already stretching their abilities to adapt. They see jobs that they considered safe niches now gone forever, with no demand for skills that took years to develop, and now the scientists are telling them that they have to change even more. That we should cease to use fossil fuels asap, that we need to switch to an energy base that features nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal, and other non-polluting sources, that they do not understand, and have no experiance with.
DF-170-181114-902_4264.11
I see otherwise intelligent people convincing themselves of the scientific equivelant of the sun rising in the West simply because they wish to avoid any more changes in the lives, and the way that they live. Which, of course, pushes the changes onto their children, and grandchildren, who will be facing a much more serious situation concerning the effects of a changing climate, a rapidly changing climate, than we face today.
DF-170-181114-902_4264.12
Well, that is the culture of this nation, and our children will suffer the consequences of our inability to face reality.

They are the first and only ones, I believe.
DF-170-181118-887_4674.3
They did the same training, made it through.

DF-170-181118-887_4674.7
Marines say, "so what are you?"
DF-170-181118-887_4674.8
And they say, "we're in the Coast Guard."
DF-170-181118-887_4674.9
And maybe they snicker a little, but they shouldn't!
DF-170-181118-887_4674.10
What makes people assume the Coast Guard is the softest branch?
DF-170-181118-887_4674.11
Ignorance?
DF-170-181118-887_4674.12
Maybe you never served in any Military branch and have no frame of reference?
DF-170-181118-887_4674.13
Not to diminish the great Navy Fleet Sailors who keep the gigantic ships running with all kinds of technical skills, Coast Guard people are the real Sailors who navigate tiny boats in high seas to rescue people, arrest criminals and keep America's shores safe.

I've been reading through several news sites tonight and I just picked up on a great story about a US Air Force pilot who probably saved a lot of US Military lives in the early goings of the Iraq War.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.2
Now let's get one thing straight, I initially agreed with the reason for going into Iraq, but I no longer agree with it.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.3
I support Obama's decision to pull our troops out by next year.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.4
I always, 100% side with our brave men and women who are putting themselves in harm's way.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.5
Now today, I came upon this story on TV.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.6
Lieutenant Colonel Victor Fehrenbach.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.7
He was promoted to Lt. Colenel in 2006.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.8
He's part of the 325th Fighter Wing Mission that serves off of Tyndall Air Force Base flying F-15C's and F-22 Raptors.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.9
He's been in the Air Force for 18 years.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.10
He is just 2 years short of retirement.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.11
He's flown missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo and has been awaiting re-deployment a new tour of duty.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.12
If you know anything about air force, he's Afelm JT Fly Trng.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.13
Back in 2003 this hero won the Air Medal for Heroism.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.14
Back in April, 2003 the Army was making the initial advance to capture Baghdad Int'l airport, Victor and his wingmen found an Iraqi ambush site of about 12 APCs that were less than a mile from the Army advance.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.15
At the time, his wingman was suffering from a major malfunction in his plane that prohibited him from deploying his weapons.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.16
Within a timespan of 20-30 minutes, he and his wingman were finally able to deploy all of their weapons and destroy the 8 APCs that were about to ambush the US Army on their mission to take Baghdad International Airport.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.17
They took out the entire enemy position and that night the Army captured Baghdad International Airport.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.18
Why am I posting this when there have been several hundred if not thousand of other US Soldiers, Seamen and Pilots who have each served their country heroicly and have also won medals, which some have even died for?
DF-170-181118-887_5920.19
Because this hero was 2 years away from retirement and is being discharged, against his will, from the Air Force. Is this because of bad behavior? No. He has an excellent record of service and has never had any problems. Then why, if this 18-year veteran who is an excellent Pilot of the US Air Force being discharged against his will, 2 years before he retires?
DF-170-181118-887_5920.20
Because he's openly gay. He's commanded squadrons, saved other American soldiers' lives and served with honor.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.21
But because he is different than we are, because he is sexually attracted to men, his sexuality trumps the incredible record of service he's had over 18 years.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.22
Are you telling me that the most professionally trained, the meanest, the fiercest military in the world that can destroy any other enemy and accomplish any goal its given, cannot accept men or women who have different seuxality tastes than other people?
DF-170-181118-887_5920.23
This Don't Ask, Don't Tell law absolutely MUST be repealed immediately!
DF-170-181118-887_5920.24
Men and women who fight to save our country, who are more than willing to die to protect our freedom, must NOT be discriminated against.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.25
It's time to end prejudice and time to accept human beings for who they are - ESPEICALLY our heroic men and women in the US Military. Support Our Troops!
DF-170-181118-887_5920.26
ALL OF THEM!
DF-170-181118-887_5920.27
In these troubled times we simply cannot do without this significant portion of potential enlistees, and talented senior members, to uphold an absurd, and bigoted, policy.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.28
Most absurdly, we are allowing ourselves to fire Arabic language specialists, people whose positions are critical at this time, due to a trait that has no effect on the performance of their duties.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.29
I know congress has a lot on their plates right now, but they need to move on this soon.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.30
Preferably with a solution that would allow soldiers lost to this idiotic policy to reenlist if they still wish to.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.31
Its not that the military is against gays.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.32
The military is against things that make it run less efficiently.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.33
Allowing blacks to enter the military increased its numbers and productivity thus the long term goals outweighed the short term unease.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.34
Allowing openly gay men/women into the service would create Long term discomfort and you would see a decrease in troop numbers as well as military efficiency.
DF-170-181118-887_5920.35
Because of the nature of the military and close quarters shared especially among men in war simulation, training and actual warfare the distraction of having someone who you know may be attracted to you can ultimately cause death because you are distracted.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.1
As part of the Army?
DF-170-181118-887_6009.2
They do pretty much the same things though the Army has the much more elite units and more highly trained infantry.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.3
The Army, as demonstrated by its successful execution of D-Day during WWII, is also capable of making daring amphibious assaults, so why not just disolve the Marines into the Army?
DF-170-181118-887_6009.4
You are aware that the Marine Corps is the only service that is protected by Congressional Act?
DF-170-181118-887_6009.5
The Marine Corps must maintain a minimum of 3 Divisions and can not be disbanded without a Congressional act.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.6
This was done in the early 1950's because of rejects like you.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.7
Because the navy needs bodyguards for the officer corps and a expeditionary force, too.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.8
Leave the fucking Marines alone.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.9
They're one of the few organizations I still have some respect for in this nation.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.10
To be honest, the Army is a great service.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.11
I have served with several stellar performers from 2ID and 3rdArmored.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.12
Got friends in the 101 and 82nd Airborne or Airmoble.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.13
The bottom line (and the hook and sinker) is that man for man, and dollar for dollar the Army cannot match the "kick in the door" specialty that our Marines do.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.14
BTW I did a force on force with the 10th Mountain in the late 80's.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.15
They were attempting to go-light and were using our FMFM's to teach em techniques.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.16
And besides, they Aint Ready to be Marines Yet.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.17
You just know I have to weigh in on this one!
DF-170-181118-887_6009.18
Each service and the Marines have their unique roles.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.19
There are of course some similarities and overlap between them.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.20
That is what allows the US military great flexibility in operational execution.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.21
Funding will always be an issue.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.22
Each service thinks their requirements are more important than the other service's.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.23
Because not everything gets funded, we go to war with the military we have and not the military we want.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.24
Obviously, there has been interservice rivalry since the first ship went to sea with fighting men on board.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.25
The army has brotherhood beef with the marines but we recognize that the marines are a unique unrivaled infantry machine.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.26
The Army has the ability to meet any infantry requirement anywhere and is set up for long term missions.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.27
The long term ability of the army mesh's with the immediate ferocity of the Marines.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.28
They are far from the same and if combined would defeat the purpose of their original designs.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.29
A funny story (at least to me).
DF-170-181118-887_6009.30
I have two sons in the Marine Corp, both of whome recently completed their MOS training and headed to their permanent duty stations.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.31
One of them went through MOS school at Fort Leonard Wood, MO.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.32
He was telling me that the Army trainee's had top salute the Marines (no matter their rank)....
DF-170-181118-887_6009.33
that to me shows the respect that the Army has for the elite US fighting force...and a respect that would be lost if they were part of the Army.
DF-170-181118-887_6009.34
He also told me that the Air Force guys got additional pay for being stationed on the same base as Marines and that the Marines were not allowed to go round in groups of more than 4, because they were concerned about what they could do to anyone.

Folks black out so to speak.
DF-170-181122-877_9923.11

I want to say something else too though.
DF-170-181122-878_0223.4
I watched a documentary about Tyson once, it was one that focused more on his fighting career than his personal life.
DF-170-181122-878_0223.5
My god, as a boxer that young man was simply awesome - and that is not a word that I use very often.
DF-170-181122-878_0223.6
If I remember correctly he won 19 out of his first 20 professional fights by first round knock out, generally consummated by a left-upper-cut struck on the jaw that would lift a 220-pound man two feet off the mat.
DF-170-181122-878_0223.7
Its impossible to compare athletes from different eras.
DF-170-181122-878_0223.8
In golf alone the equipment is so much better now than it was even 10 years ago let alone 20 or 30 years ago.
DF-170-181122-878_0223.9
Its also impossible to compare the competition levels.
DF-170-181122-878_0223.10
I don't think Tyson was ever slated to be the greatest boxer of all time.
DF-170-181122-878_0223.11
Regardless of his skills, he never had the competition during his era to be considered the greatest
DF-170-181122-878_0223.12
Ali defeated Liston, Frazier, Norton and Forman who were all better than anyone Tyson ever faced

I found out today that the Blockbuster Video that I go to is closing down.
DF-170-181122-878_0709.2
This is the fourth store in my area to close in the last year, and I'm actually a bit upset about it, because the few that remain aren't close enough to drive to.
DF-170-181122-878_0709.3
Blockbusters already drove the mom and pop videostores out of business, and they are being driven out by movies on line, movies on demand, and movies by mail- businesses they are trying to get into.
DF-170-181122-878_0709.4
I guess some would call this progress, but I think we are losing something as well.
DF-170-181122-878_0709.5
Redbox is a simpler version of Blockbuster, in that you can still go to a Redbox and browse and get a movie right then and there.
DF-170-181122-878_0709.6
I actually prefer the Redbox because it doesn't have nearly as much selection.
DF-170-181122-878_0709.7
Enough but not so much that I stand there for an hour, you know?
DF-170-181122-878_0709.8
All of the Blockbusters around us closed down.
DF-170-181122-878_0709.9
You can get some great deals on movies/tv shows as they unload their inventory.
DF-170-181122-878_0709.10
They drop the prices each week so if you're looking for something in-particular, nows a good time to keep an eye out for it.
DF-170-181122-878_0709.11
Also, when ours closed down they offered a free movie (that you were buying anyways, I think whatever the cheapest movie you were purchasing) and a month free of Blockbuster online (it's like Netflix).
DF-170-181122-878_0709.12
You can just cancel before the one month timeframe is over.
DF-170-181122-878_0709.13
I took them up on the offer... good deal.

One, the protesters were not targeted.

That's an invention of the blog reprinting this.
DF-183-195681-794_9722.8
Second, I have a really hard time believing that there were any ACTUAL "explosives," since the news story they link to talks about one guy getting arrested for THREATENING Governor Brownback.
DF-183-195681-794_9722.9
Nothing about explosives charges, etcetera, which they'd be quick on top of if there were any actual explosives.
DF-183-195681-794_9722.10
Given the way these stories get exaggerated, "several improvised explosive devices" could mean anything down to a few bundles of firecrackers -- or nothing at all, since false reports aren't at all uncommon.
DF-183-195681-794_9722.11
Doubly so since they apparently did not even bother to tow the truck, so clearly there wasn't a serious threat.
DF-183-195681-794_9722.12

I turned on my coputer this morning and instead of opening the internet to my Google home page (White) it opened to a page called "Blackle" which was black.
DF-199-192769-667_8409.2
I thought, hmm, they do funny things with the Google letters for holidays, so maybe today is Blackle Wednesday or something.
DF-199-192769-667_8409.3
I "Blackled" it and found out they changed the page to black to save energy.
DF-199-192769-667_8409.4
Does this make sense?

DF-199-192769-667_8409.6

DF-199-192769-667_8409.8
Also, when we have a choice for skins, like I think we do (or did at one time) here on A2K, then we could all contribute to the energy savings by using the black skin, right?

So, we could participate that way, too.

We are probably all familiar with the traditional saying regarding suicide - that it is a "coward's way out."
DF-199-192772-681_0232.4
My question is this: Is it really? Or is it the opposite?
DF-199-192772-681_0232.5
That is, does the act of suicide actually require courage to commit?
DF-199-192772-681_0232.6
Personally I believe it requires a tremendous amount of courage and perhaps the greatest amount of courage of any possible action.
DF-199-192772-681_0232.7
After all, we are speaking of terminating one's own life, perhaps forever ending one's existence.
DF-199-192772-681_0232.8
We all have our thoughts on what comes next, but no one can be certain.
DF-199-192772-681_0232.9
One may be forever ending his existence, or he may be forever subjecting himself to punishment if the religious views on suicide being a sin are correct.
DF-199-192772-681_0232.10
Either way though, one is entering the unknown by willingly terminating his life, which blatantly violates the biological drive to live, to continue existing.
DF-199-192772-681_0232.11
How can this not be an extremely courageous act, much more so that "finding the courage to remain alive in the face of unbeatable problems?"
DF-199-192772-681_0232.12
Remaining alive to face one's problems is continuing the state of existence that one has always known.
DF-199-192772-681_0232.13
Ending that life is journeying into something new, something that may be better or may be worse than the current state of existence the individual is comfortably familiar with.
DF-199-192772-681_0232.14
Either way he is terminating his life and accepting the state of death that deep down we all fear.
DF-199-192772-681_0232.15
How can one consider voluntarily entering that state cowardly?
DF-199-192772-681_0232.16
@Elmud, Well, I think your reasoning has merit:
DF-199-192772-681_0232.17
[INDENT]One is fearful of some thing One overcomes their fear to do that thing In so doing, one can therefore said to have courage [/INDENT]
DF-199-192772-681_0232.18
So yes; strictly speaking, I think you're correct.
DF-199-192772-681_0232.19
Although I must admit, it strikes me as very unproductive to give praiseworthy words to such an act.
DF-199-192772-681_0232.20
"He had the courage to kill himself"; though correct in this sense, leads to a 'destructive' conclusion.
DF-199-192772-681_0232.21
As a side note, labeling it as a "cowardly" or "easy" way out - I think - is simply people using derision to express their disapproval.
DF-199-192772-681_0232.22
Such disapproval may be certainly warranted - and I disapprove of it generally - but what one must go through (mentally, emotionally and/or experiencially) can hardly be called "easy".
DF-199-192772-681_0232.23
I can also envision a state where, for me, such a solution could be warranted; not a good one to be sure, but conceivable nonetheless.
DF-199-192772-681_0232.24
To fight with every last stitch of breath for even the most-remote possibility for "things getting better" is what I hold to.

According to most analyses, from within and without the petroleum Industry, the world supply of oil, relative consumption, will effectively peak in the next decade.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.2
What does this mean?
DF-199-192772-681_0984.3
If demand exceeds supply, someone will neccessarily have to go without.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.4
The issue is who?
DF-199-192772-681_0984.5
Some nations will be priced out, most likely the relatively undeveloped countries in which automotive transportation is not really essential.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.6
However, when there is not enough oil to satisfy even the industrialized nations, which totally depend on oil not only for transportation, but for farming, various chemicals industries, etc., how will they likely respond?
DF-199-192772-681_0984.7
Obviously, war is a possiblity; they have been fought for far less in the past.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.8
Of course, access to petroleum itelf is not the only issue.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.9
Most of the world's food is grown using modern farming methods that require enormous amounts of gas.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.10
If the amount of surplus food suddenly decreases as a result of peak oil, the poor around the world will starve, lamentable in itself, causing instabilities that could lead to conflict over scarce resoures.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.11
China comes to mind.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.12
The economy of that nation is being built, with questionable logic by the central planners, on the western model: i.e. dependent on cheap petroleum.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.13
What is unique about China is that the ruling party's legitmacy is intimately assosciated with rapid economic progress.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.14
If this were suddenly to halt or risk collapse, would that ruling party push the country into war, either to acquire access to oil or simply as a distraction, as so many authoritarian regimes have done in the past?
DF-199-192772-681_0984.15
There is shift of power occuring in Asia, as China and Russia exert their influence.

The Shangai Cooperation Organization of which they, along with Ian, Pakistan and most of the former Soviet republics, are memebers, has stated that it intends to remove U.S. influence from the region and failitate the rise of a 'multi-polar world.'
DF-199-192772-681_0984.17
I don't want to guess their specific motives, but it seems to me that such an arrangement could be very advanategous for those nations in the event of a crisis brought on by peak oil.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.18
Between Russia and Iran, they would have access to enormous oil reserves, from which they could, if supplies were too short, deny the U.S. Saudi Arabia comes to mind as well.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.19
As anyone who has done even the most superficial research on that nation would know, the House of Saud is a joke, a paper tiger and a tyranny hated by most of its people.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.20
If elections were held their, or if there was a struggle for power, the regime that woudl arise would be friendly with Iran and extremely antagonistic to the U.S.: quite understandably I might add.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.21
With the largest oil reserves in the world, it is vital that the U.S. maintain contorl over Saudi Arabia, which means propping up the House of Saud, and it would be equally benificial to Iran or to China and its partners in Asia to facilitate a revolution there, which would allow them greater access by default.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.22
And so, after all that, which you might justly consider paranoia, my question is basically this; in light of the threat of peak oil, and of the general decline in American economic might relative the rest of the world (not to mention the current U.S. crisis), what do think the world will look like in a decade or two?
DF-199-192772-681_0984.23

Even if it set transportation, technology and civilization in general back some, I'd think a "reboot in a better direction" (read: away from finite resources, fossil fuels) is so much the better.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.29

There is no question that the coming century will see a confluence and will be a critical turning point in human history.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.31

We may very well be called upon to choose between collective life and death.

The potential is there for both.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.34
If we so choose to do so the technology we will have available in the near term future is perfectly capable of salvaging the situation.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.35
But if we don't and we allow our technological civilisation to collapse under its own weight, the next generations of humans will have to do without the major stepping stone of an oil based economy.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.36
There simply will not be enough oil left.

I think what you are going to see is a shift towards localized economies.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.39
As the oil supply becomes smaller and population grows there just will not be enough to feed the system.
DF-199-192772-681_0984.40
Hopefully, people realize that it is going to take oil to move beyond oil, so the focus should be using what is readily available wisely, before the shift becomes extremely expensive.

Don't ask me why but I need to know what happens if you dye your eyebrows.
DF-199-192780-692_1964.3
Say you want to disguise yourself by bleaching dark hair blonde and that you wanted to do the eyebrows as well to complete the disguise.
DF-199-192780-692_1964.4
Now the hair on your head will eventually grow and you'll lose the blonde-ness, but what about the eyebrows?
DF-199-192780-692_1964.5
I don't remember ever having them cut or trimmed, so would they stay blonde?
DF-199-192780-692_1964.6
Eyebrows have a different "terminal length" than head-hair -- that is, they grow to a certain length (and not longer), then fall out.
DF-199-192780-692_1964.7
They're still going through the growth process, though.
DF-199-192780-692_1964.8

Its the same with long-haired dogs and short-haired dogs.
DF-199-192780-692_1964.16
The short haired dog has hair strands that (on the average) fall out or break before the average long-haired dog's.
DF-199-192780-692_1964.17
Eyebrow hairs grow much slower than head hair, so if you dye everything together, your head hair will show "roots" long before the eyebrows do.
DF-199-192780-692_1964.18
I dye my eyebrows all the time, whether I'm doing a touch up to the roots, or my entire head.
DF-199-192780-692_1964.19
So, that's every 2 weeks.
DF-199-192780-692_1964.20
I don't know how fast my eyebrows grow, but after 2 weeks there's always a grey one in there somewhere.
DF-199-192780-692_1964.21
I guess they grow as fast as women seem to need to pluck them.
DF-199-192780-692_1964.22
BTW, when you're dying them, use a Q-tip, and make sure you get it all the way to the root.

A "Theory" is nothing more than an explanation of known facts...when and if the facts change, the theory would be expected to change. Therefore, any proposed "Theory" that is not supported by known facts is to be rejected. However, support for any one theory does not
DF-199-192780-692_2046.4
automatically lead to a rejection of a second or even a third if those
DF-199-192780-692_2046.5
theories are also supported by the facts.
DF-199-192780-692_2046.6
Facts, not interpetations, are the basis for evaluation. An open and
DF-199-192780-692_2046.7
curious mind and a regard for truth are still the basis for good science.

Media coverage and political support are not.
DF-199-192780-692_2046.9
It's a common argument that the Universe is tuned "just so" for life to exist, and that any slight modification means that "life" would be impossible.
DF-199-192780-692_2046.10
But this premise assumes that life as we know it is the only form of life that *can* exist. And I disagree with this assumption.
DF-199-192780-692_2046.11
The life we see around us evolved in this Universe as conditions allowed, so it's not surprising at all that everything fits nicely. Other Universes with different rules would necessarily have life in them which fits that universe. And Universes which are sterile have no life in them to question the fact that they are not there.
DF-199-192780-692_2046.12
The really interesting thing to realize is that life evolves in Universes (at least this one) at all. Is the evolution of life in a Universe pure chance, or is it inevitable?
DF-199-192780-692_2046.13
In our universe at least, life not only can exist, but does exist. And that means that our Universe is itself, alive, in a very real sense. And we are its thoughts.
DF-199-192780-692_2046.14
A variant on the multi universe which seems to me obvious, and very real, is the infinite universe.
DF-199-192780-692_2046.15
Here the universe that we perceive is simply one cell of infinity, the others being like or unlike "cells" beyond our own, but filling the remainder of "everything" beyond our specific "this" with "otherthings", identical, or not.
DF-199-192780-692_2046.16
If we look at the magnitudinal stratification of this universe we go from, as we interpret it, and with our current ability to decern at sub nano levels, the smallest subatomic particles through atoms, molecules, solids, constructs, and on, and on, and on, to planets, star systems, galaxies, and on to our entire known universe.
DF-199-192780-692_2046.17
Would it not be foolish to assume this "Mandelbrot" like lattice would stop at the extreem of our meagre ability to observe, rather than continue to follow its serial makeup to unimagined levels of structure, and beyond to infinity (infinity, of course not being a point, but rather a lack of constraint quantifier).

multiverse
DF-199-192780-692_2046.19
I was working on a research project on the concept of the multiverse and while I enjoyed the incoherent rambling argument on whether there is a god or not Im feeling kind of empty. The universe is the way it is because if it werent then we wouldnt be able to contemplate on whether therte is a god or not. And trying to justify the existence of god through anything dealing with relativity is laughable. God is only able to exist through faith. And faith goes against everything that science stands for.
DF-199-192780-692_2046.20
A key issue in disscussion of "life" and "universes" is what constitutes "structure" or "order". For example, to take BGW's (and Capra's) fractal model of embedded "structures" we are still left with the regression problem of " who observes/defines such structure".
DF-199-192780-692_2046.21
My own conclusion is that terms like "multiverse" have no separate reality with respect to a singular concept whilst the criteria for "reality" concern explanation of what we call "events" in the single universe. I am saying that the occurence of "life" is not an "event" in the usual sense because events presuppose "observers" who classify them as such. (Observation in "our minds eye" is cognitive sleight of hand) Note also the term "multi" implies "one who classifies or counts" and we can ask again who is this other than ourselves ?
DF-199-192780-692_2046.22
In short, the corollary the universe appears like it is because we are like we are is equally valid.
DF-199-192780-692_2046.23
The transcendent question is of course "what constitutes explanation " and how can this encompass the interaction of observer and observed ?

Rather than take a reductionist view proposing infinite, slightly different universes that somehow interact (alah M-Theory), allow for strong emergence via the Landauer-Lloyd analysis of flaws in the of the Laplace's demon argument that supports reductionists. Basically this states the final outcome of a system may not be soley defined by outcomes written into the basic laws of physics * a gazzillion atoms, but there can be "a cosmic imperative" written into the laws of nature (Paul Davies - Macquarie Uni - Sydney, Australia - Emergent biological principles and the computational resources of the universe, Complexity vol 10(2), p1"
DF-199-192780-692_2046.25
So basically ultra complex systems can produce wierd outcomes; such as rocks, intelligent life or high temperature superconductors all from the same raw materials - simply arranged slightly differentally. This might bring down the number of universes required to create life from infinite to merely fairly large!

As Butrflynet pointed out, Gabrielle Gifford's office is doing quite a lot.

That doesn't seem incidental or trivial to me.
DF-199-192783-683_3529.9
Gabrielle Giffords was voted in because people agreed with her policies and approach to politics.
DF-199-192783-683_3529.10
She hand-selected this group of people who now make up her office, with the intent of working together to implement her vision.
DF-199-192783-683_3529.11
In that way, she is still the representative, as these people take her stated vision and priorities and work to make them happen.
DF-199-192783-683_3529.12
If Giffords is unable to recover fully before the next election, I think it would make sense that her second-in-command, or whomever has been most instrumental in the work that her office has been doing since the injury, goes ahead and runs in her place.

All the Democrats in the house could take a year-long vacation and the results would largely be the same, so Giffords's absence from her duties is hardly consequential.

It might be a good idea to keep track of this woman. Some basics from her wiki biography might be helpful.
DF-199-192783-683_4157.2
The Congresswoman, who is about to turn 55, was born in Iowa. When her parents divorced, she moved to Minnesota with her mother. She worked in a kibbutz after high school, attended Winona State University, the now defunct law school at Oral Roberts University and the William and Mary Law School where she took a master's degree in tax law.
DF-199-192783-683_4157.3
She has been married for 30 years. "Bachmann and her husband own a Christian counseling clinic in Stillwater, Minnesota.
DF-199-192783-683_4157.4
Bachmann also has an ownership stake in Waumandee, Wisconsin farm land. Since the death of her father-in-law, the farm and its buildings have been rented out to a neighboring farmer who maintains a dairy herd on the farm. From 1995 through 2006, the tenant-farmer received $251,973 in federal subsidies, chiefly for dairy and corn price supports."
DF-199-192783-683_4157.5
Initially a Democrat, she became disillusioned with Jimmy Carter. In 1976, the CHristian documentary by Francis Schaeffer, "How Should We Then Live?" impelled her to take up an anti-abortion stance and she and her fiance began praying outside abortion facilities.
DF-199-192783-683_4157.6
"In 1993, Bachmann and other parents started a K-12 charter school in Stillwater, and she began speaking against a state-mandated set of educational standards, which propelled her into the world of politics.
DF-199-192783-683_4157.7
Bachmann became an outspoken critic and opponent of Minnesota's School-to-Work policies. In a 1999 column, she wrote: "School-to-Work alters the basic mission and purpose of K-12 academic education away from traditional broad-based academic studies geared toward maximizing intellectual achievement of the individual. Instead, School-to-Work utilizes the school day to promote children's acquisition of workplace skills, viewing children as trainees for increased economic productivity."*

Obama's view that affirmative action should, after these many years, continue may lead to his defeat in November.

And this may be the correct result.

Affirmative action equates to discrimination against nonbeneficiaries, usually while males. Obama says he is against quotas, but so-called goals are invariable set up.

DF-199-192783-684_3424.2
Why has he deserted?
DF-199-192783-684_3424.3
His absence has been explained many times in many different ways, but he has virtually disappeared from the scene.

This wouldn't be so important, but he still is the vice president, isn't he?

Rumsfeld, who was enjoying a limelight, is now being asked to keep a low profile, since his abrasive personality has alienated so many.

Poor Bush, no matter how many times they parade him, still isn't impressive.

He's been 'off the radar' for a long time.
DF-199-192783-684_3424.20

President Bush on the other hand continues to claim the economy is strong, not as strong as it could be but strong nonetheless.
DF-199-192783-684_3600.5
He has however presented a package which he contends will stimulate the economy and create jobs.
DF-199-192783-684_3600.6
Over half of the package $367 billion will come by removing the tax on dividends.
DF-199-192783-684_3600.7
What do you think of the package will it stimulate the economy ?
DF-199-192783-684_3600.8
In addition if the economy remains sluggish what are Bush's chances for re-election?
DF-199-192783-684_3600.9
Yeah, it'll stimulate the top ten percent of the wealthy in this country, but will do nothing for our economy.
DF-199-192783-684_3600.10
Money must be put into the hands of the middle class and the poor for our economy to be stimulated.
DF-199-192783-684_3600.11
The best way to accomplish that is to cut everybody's taxes by ten percent effective January 1, 2003.
DF-199-192783-684_3600.12

He was explaining to the (of course, liberal) quizzical reporter how he could be a Republican.
DF-199-192783-684_3808.10
It was as if he had to apologize to the entire black community...
DF-199-192783-684_3808.11
I was proud that he told the reporter he felt racially stereotyped to be expected to be a Democrat.

Clinton had a women secretary of state, and Rice does not represent blacks, so what is your beef?
DF-199-192783-684_3808.20
What amuses me about Rice is that she lived in the South during the Civil Rights movement, and that experience seems to have left her untouched.
DF-199-192783-684_3808.21
Yet Bush mentioned that background as though she actually did anything beyond striving toward her own growth.
DF-199-192783-684_3808.22
More power to her for her achievements.
DF-199-192783-684_3808.23
But don't be surprised if you're not hearing wild applause from her community, because I'm not sure she has one...
DF-199-192783-684_3808.24
Assuming she establishes a credible name for herself as Secretary of State, I am cautiously anticipating the GOP nominee in 2008 to be Condoleeza Rice.
DF-199-192783-684_3808.25
And yes, I think she can be elected easily assuming that the GOP is allowed something close to a level playing field.

personally i look upon this conflict as the source of 90% of western-muslim's confrontation,
DF-199-192783-684_8497.2
the US needs and so supports Israel, Israel wants to stop attacks on its citizens and so strike on palestinian targets, which in turn results in more attacks on Israel, this increases the number of radical muslims too, which results in attacks against america around the world(military targets, embassies, and citizens) resulting in american foriegn policy like the war on Iraq and/or Afghanistan, and the circle continues, reactions to actions resulting in reactions, this circle having No beginning and no end
DF-199-192783-684_8497.3

People like you have done more to screw this country up than "the democrats" could ever have hoped to do.
DF-199-192783-685_0989.33
You repeatedly voted for and supported a president and an administration who was clearly and obviously incompetent and ideologically extreme.
DF-199-192783-685_0989.34
This was evident from campaign through the early years of governance.
DF-199-192783-685_0989.35
You think that America means red, white, and blue and war and think nothing of shredding the constitution on the way to more blood and glory.
DF-199-192783-685_0989.36
And you dare to presume that you are somehow the "real Americans" and the rest of us, those of us who actually know what the Constitution says and know what this ignoramus is trying to do to it, are somehow going to destroy "your" country.
DF-199-192783-685_0989.37
You wave your flag and trust an ignorant incompetent who can't even run this country to somehow rebuild another, one that he didn't even begin to understand and had never been to.
DF-199-192783-685_0989.38
You trust an idiot.
DF-199-192783-685_0989.39
You think the answer to incompetence and mismanagement is faith.
DF-199-192783-685_0989.40
You and your brethren, the Bush die-hards, have sent this country in a death spiral.
DF-199-192783-685_0989.41
And sadly, the only people we can have any hope of pulling us out are the "other party".
DF-199-192783-685_0989.42
A party that already was waning in respect due to corruption and its willingness to take some fundamental social justice concepts too far is now supported by a majority of the public, and the beloved party of small government and individual liberties is now a hulking rusty heap of corruption, scandal, incompetence, special interests, big government, and domestic spying.
DF-199-192783-685_0989.43

I was reading in the paper today about all the laws under consideration that would make it harder for Americans to vote when I suddenly flashed on all the purple fingered Iraqi voters that were so celebrated in our press only a few short years ago.
DF-199-192784-587_3990.2
I think I must be missing something because I'm really confused by this.
DF-199-192784-587_3990.3
Why would any state do anything that would make it harder for it's citizens to vote?
DF-199-192784-587_3990.4
Please can someone explain this to me?
DF-199-192784-587_3990.5
That's pretty easy.
DF-199-192784-587_3990.6
Conseratives figure (and probably with justification) that their voter base will get out and vote without regard for any minor hurdles which might be thrown in their way.
DF-199-192784-587_3990.7
They rely on older citizens and more affluent citizens.
DF-199-192784-587_3990.8
Anything which makes voting more difficult they figure will reduce the number of voters going to the polls to vote for Democrats.
DF-199-192784-587_3990.9
I don't have a problem with the first two - provided that they make available photo IDs at no cost to people with limited income and allow clear instructions and make it easy to obtain (in other words - there are many locations to obtain and enough hours that are varied enough to get these ids).
DF-199-192784-587_3990.10
I support having IDs to limit voter fraud, but you cannot make it difficult and it should be economically feasible for all to get an ID.
DF-199-192784-587_3990.11
I mean if you make the extra effort to go out and vote - it shouldn't be much more a burden to get an ID.
DF-199-192784-587_4187.1
The Democrats must return to their progressive program, and must spend the resources necessary to remind the people that the GOP, the right wing, the Tea Party are just plain wrong on the issues.

Hopefully the Massachusetts loss has made Obama go back on the progressive track.

What is interesting about the 2 party system is the people never actually vote FOR a party.
DF-199-192784-587_4187.4
They always vote AGAINST THE OTHER ONE.

We asked you: To save money, should local governments use nonviolent inmates for physical labor?
DF-199-192784-587_4261.2
That was the question in the other day's opinion section of my my local newspaper.

DF-199-192784-587_4261.5
@David cv, Depending on country it is already done.
DF-199-192784-587_4261.6
Hard labour,chaingangs,prison farms Voluntary work while incarcerated gets minimal pay etc
DF-199-192784-587_4261.7
The option as voluntary will at least not require quotas and enforcement through violent means(beatings) or witholding of priveledges like food,bedding(yes bedding)or outdoor sunlight and isolation.(legislativ brutality encouragement)
DF-199-192784-587_4261.8
The question is what kind of work is beneficial in a crime and punishment related way.
DF-199-192784-587_4261.9
Some experiements are already implemented in disaster relief bushfires/floods,comunity work as replacement for incarceration.(Anti social behaviour treatment)
DF-199-192784-587_4261.10
It really depends on the moral standards of the Nation in question.
DF-199-192784-587_4261.11
Forced labour in Europe compared to Africa or America is implemented differently

@secondchance, I think that drugs can have positives but I think that they'll rarely come without negatives and whether or not it's a net positive is hard for anyone to tell, most of all the user.

Looking for information from anyone who has had it or with someone recuperating.
DF-199-192794-661_0184.3
I have heard the recovery is brutally painful.

Any tips, suggestions, etc., about what to expect during first few days, how to manage, sleep, any info.
DF-199-192794-661_0184.5
I had it done three years ago at Johns Hopkins.
DF-199-192794-661_0184.6
I had suffered low grade "bursitis" in one shoulder for many years (probably a worn rotator cuff), until one day while working out I got a real, full tear.
DF-199-192794-661_0184.7
Lots of serious pain with some movements or any strenuous exertion.
DF-199-192794-661_0184.8
My surgery was successful, but it took me several months to regain my range of motion in the shoulder.
DF-199-192794-661_0184.9
I learned that the post op therapy is probably more critical than the surgery itself.
DF-199-192794-661_0184.10
I was determined to restore the range of motion and to return to my old exercise routine, so I in effect took charge of the rehab program and made it clear to the therapist the Orthopedic Surgeon that I wouldn't accept less.
DF-199-192794-661_0184.11
In retrospect I believe this was the critical thing, in that the Docs. and the therapists take their cues from the patient -- if you passively accept less than full recovery, they will let you go.
DF-199-192794-661_0184.12
If you are determined to go on, they will help.
DF-199-192794-661_0184.13

Noddy, from your post I assume you have not checked on the models currently on the market.
DF-199-192794-661_2329.12
Most companies have fully automatic models that don't require adjusting it to your arm with every use.
DF-199-192794-661_2329.13
You adjust it once to fit your arm (You can do this with it off your arm; it might take two tries) and that's that.

Slip it on your arm. Press a button and in less than a minute read your B.P. and heart rate.

Search out a glycemia index, and determine something both edible and low on the list.

Add that to your diet, to avoid getting into hypoglycemia.

Indulge in a light bedtime snack, again, something fairly low on the list.
DF-199-192794-661_2918.11
Don't overdo it, though.

i have not yet been diagnosed but i am beginning to suspect hypoglycemia/low blood sugar.
DF-199-192794-661_2918.13
lately i have been very confused, have anxiety, dizziness, fatigued, weak, depressed, and generally low.
DF-199-192794-661_2918.14
i know i need to gain more weight - i lost about 20 pounds suddenly about 6 months ago and haven't been able to gain it back.
DF-199-192794-661_2918.15
how does a doctor diagnose someone with this?
DF-199-192794-661_2918.16
what tests should i have them run?
DF-199-192794-661_6605.1
I have been reading about FluMist, the new flu vaccine that is administered intranasally.
DF-199-192794-661_6605.2
One thing that I noticed, is that it is marketed as suitable for people ages 5-49.
DF-199-192794-661_6605.3
I have not seen any material as to why the 50+ population is unsuitable for this vaccine.
DF-199-192794-661_6605.4
Anybody know why?
DF-199-192794-661_6605.5
Well, according to that FDA link children between 5 and 17 are the most likely to actually get the flu itself and it looks like that was the intended target age group for the development of FluMist.
DF-199-192794-661_6605.6
They note that it is 87% effective in preventing people in that range from getting the flu at all but people in the 18-49 range only had lessened symptoms.
DF-199-192794-661_6605.7
It seems the older the patient the less effective the drug.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.1
It is inconceivable that you take a multivitamin in good faith and it wrecks havoc on your health in such a profound way but that is the case.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.2
I "was" taking a Centrum multivitamin once a day as suggested on the back label and I was waking up with dry mouth so sever I could not even swallow.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.3
My skin was getting scaly, my eyes burning and my feet were so dry they begin to develop calluses and crack.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.4
I stopped my vitamin and it is now gone.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.5
WHAT IS UP CENTRUM?
DF-199-192796-652_9700.6
It is not just Centrum but any type of multivitamin causes this.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.7
If you search the internet for "dry mouth and multivitamin" you get this idiot named "Jade M" on Google answers that replies that it is "not likely" that a multivitamin is causing this dryness of nearly every cell in the body.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.8
Sorry to say Jade M whoever you are but you are WRONG...
DF-199-192796-652_9700.9
If you don't know what you are talking about you shouldn't be doling out incorrect information in an online medical forum.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.10
My sister is a nurse at a veterans hospital and she complained to her doctor that she was getting dry mouth.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.11
He told her that it was her multivitamin and she cut down her intake of the multivitamin and her dry mouth left completely.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.12
A friend of mine who takes many medications for his heart just came up to me and told me he was getting terrible dry mouth at night and reduced his multivitamin to only a few times a week and now no more dry mouth.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.13
In other words if you follow the directions on the back label of your vitamins they will start slowly killing you.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.14
Don't expect Paul G. Donohue M.D.to help you either.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.15
He basically dismisses this elderly persons claim then tries to get her to take corrective medications.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.16
How typical...
DF-199-192796-652_9700.17
I get dry mouth too plus my skin gets dry and scaly and when I stop my multivitamin it immediately goes away.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.18
Now this is four completely unrelated people all coming to the exact same conclusion.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.19
Not only can we not trust the general consensus on the internet but we cannot trust people who have PHD credentials giving their advice online.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.20
What do we have to dry up and die before we finally figure out what ails us?
DF-199-192796-652_9700.21
When my sister told this to me I did not really give it much thought.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.22
Then I permanently lost 10% of my eyesight due to dry eyes.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.23
Then my mouth chronically became dry, skin kept piling up on my feet that I couldn't sand it off fast enough to keep up with it, the skin on my hands became scaly and my lips kept cracking and my tongue felt like it had pins and needles poking into it.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.24
I stop the multivitamin and my mouth symptoms are gone, sadly my eyesight is still damaged.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.25
I should have just listened to my sister rather than err, Jade M.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.26
My doctor was even prescribing fish oil supplements to correct the dry skin problem which could not even put a dent in the problems being caused by my multivitamin.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.27
I don't consume a lot of salt in my diet and I am on no other medications or drugs whatsoever.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.28
If you are experiencing dry mouth and take a multivitamin stop the vitamin immediately before you ruin your health irreversibly.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.29
Take it only a few times a week, if that, and you will realize the vitamins cause this.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.30
I was also told by a pharmacist that other than the antioxidants, a person gets what they need from their diet of most minerals and do not require a multivitamin at all.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.31
So a strictly antioxidant formula is all that is required minus the multivitamin minerals.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.32
Please weigh in on this, sorry I am upset about this but I am also troubled now by internet advice that is clearly WRONG about this issue and no telling how many others.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.33
Tinnitus, vision loss, global cellular degeneration, moisture loss, and even constipation are all caused by general use of multivitamins.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.34
Also if you are feeding your children multivitamins you should be highly cautious of this too.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.35
Even children should only be given a multivitamin a few times a week and not every day.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.36
They should be explained the dangers of regular use of vitamins (in other words following the prescribed dosage).
DF-199-192796-652_9700.37
Take it from me who has experienced this first hand, my sister who is a nurse, my friend taking many meds whose dry mouth stopped the very day he cut down on his multivitamin and L.F who was incorrectly advised by, err, Donehue.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.38
It is a sad commentary that people have to collectively learn this on their own and that doctors, health specialists and the internet are so out of the loop.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.39
Consider that vitamin waters and health food drinks on top of a multivitamin only compound this problem.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.40
I forget what my sister said was causing this, I seem to recall zinc, but I may be wrong about that.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.41
I have to ask her again.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.42
Consider if it is visibly destroying your skin it is also destroying your major organs too.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.43
Please comment and offer any further advice on this subject.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.44
I just started on a new kind of multivitamin and my body's been all kinds of crazy.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.45
I used to just take specific vitamins but that got expensive and elaborate and I was missing some things so I switched to a multi.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.46
The multi has calcium and I know from previous experience that calcium tears my stomach up.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.47
I'm getting older and I know that I need some calcium though.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.48
I don't have dry mouth but I agree that multivitamins can have unintended consequences.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.49
I have been taking high potency multivitamins for almost twenty years.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.50
I have not know any side effects.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.51
One thing, though is to not have certain foods too close to the time of the taking, because certain ones can interact.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.52
For instance, I am taking something now that advises to not take regular vitamin C for an hour on either side of taking that product.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.53
It suggests discontinuing the 12 hour release of Vitamin C for as long as that product is being used.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.54
I have to constantly make such comparisons to make sure it all works.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.55
I am on very high dose vitamin C, besides my green multiple, that is very concentrated compared top wimpy Centrum.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.56
I never had dry mouth until this high dose of C, so I am assuming it is the C.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.57
I use it as an antihistamine to control my IBS.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.58
I have overactive mast cells that start pulling water into my gut when i run out of C and Magnesium (this I think was caused by taking a round of vaccines in 2003, and the studies I found online confirm that mercury in the adjuvants often do cause increased histamine production).
DF-199-192796-652_9700.59
So I am on 4000-6000mg of C 4X daily and 400-600 mg Magnesium 4 x Daily.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.60
This is a lot, but I have learned it does control my bowels.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.61
The normal person would get colon blow from these doses, and it firms me up to normal.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.62
This is ultimately an adrenal issue, as the adrenals are throwing out huge amounts of electrolytes and I am sure other stuff, so until I realized this I was in constant loose bowels losing my nutrients.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.63
But it HAS caused dry mouth.
DF-199-192796-652_9700.64
I don't think it is as bad as some I have read here.
DF-199-192815-662_3987.1
There are some archaelogists who believe that two sites in Syria could be the world's earliest cities.

According to this, American citizens can now be arrested and detained indefinitely without trial.
DF-199-192821-670_2458.2
Does that mean that anyone can be taken and put into a hole forever without justification?

If so, I think it's scary.
DF-199-192821-670_2458.4
But who decides that the person was actually a member of or working for Al Qaeda?

Well, the verdict just came in.
DF-199-192821-670_2474.2
Guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
DF-199-192821-670_2474.3
The judge would not let him be released until sentencing either.
DF-199-192821-670_2474.4
The judge said his behavior was wreckless and the community could be in harm's way. (Not his exact words).

I am glad he is losing his license.

DF-199-192821-670_2956.3

I thought a verbal agreement would override a written agreement, but is that hard to prove?
DF-199-192821-670_2956.8

DF-199-192821-670_2956.12
Leave early?
DF-199-192821-670_2956.13
It sounds like they were waiving certain fees, with the understanding that you were going to stay for the long haul.
DF-199-192821-670_2956.14
If you left early, then they now want all their fees.

My newspaper has an article today on animal hoarders, listing some signifigant recent cases:
DF-199-192821-670_6556.2
One woman lived on an old school bus with 117 dogs, 4 cats and 2 chickens.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.3
One man had 500 dogs.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.4
Another had 80 cats.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.5
Two weeks ago, animal services confiscated 39 cats living with a man in a van.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.6
Most hoarders live in unimaginable filth.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.7
(I didn't want to post the photos because they are really gross.)
DF-199-192821-670_6556.8
Most of these people are charged with animal abuse and neglect and they are fined and jailed.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.9
Do you think these people are criminals?
DF-199-192821-670_6556.10
i watched animal planet (way too late at night this weekend) and saw a florida animal cops.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.11
They busted a hoarder with 82 dogs and confiscated 78 of them (i think legally in fla you can have 4).
DF-199-192821-670_6556.12
The dogs were in such bad shape, some couldn't walk because their nails were so long, most were flea infested and had been sleeping in their own feces.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.13
there were two sets of puppies in the house and as they panned around the house, it appeared that there were at least two other sets of puppies in the making.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.14
the woman was not prosecuted as long as she was willing to give up the amount needed to take her back to the legal limit.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.15
and they checked up on her after that.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.16
apparently the media ran a story about it and over 40 dogs were adopted the first day they were available.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.17
i go for mentally ill as well, but like freeduck said, sometimes the only way to get them treatment is to prosecute.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.18
They just told this woman they would keep checking up on her (randomly so she couldn't hide pets like she was when they were rounding them up) and as long as she had only 4, she was fine.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.19
that seems reasonable to me since no dogs were dead, no dogs were starving, they just needed more attention.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.20
it was a much better story than the dog chained to a tree for 3 weeks in florida heat that finally succumbed...made me cry.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.21
now those people should be tied to a tree with no food and water and see how they do...

We had our own local "cat lady" who made the newspaper headlines a couple of decades ago.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.23
She lived in a filthy, almost uninhabitable house surrounded by cats, cats, cats.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.24
Many people tried to help her, but she made it impossible for anyone to give her effective assistance even in the face of having her home condemned.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.25
And that's what eventually happened.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.26
Her house was declared a public nuisance and the city tore it down.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.27
I'm pretty sure this old lady had more than just a few screws loose.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.28
I saw her many years ago at a local supermarket.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.29
She was wearing a drab winter coat and a large colorful scarf around her head with her unkempt gray wig hairs sticking out.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.30
She was slumped against a wall and the store personnel had called an ambulance.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.31
It was a pathetic sight.
DF-199-192821-670_6556.32
I think it is a kind of depression myself, where one lets go of a lot of effort to keep up with daily life except to 'care' for animals, and then is overwhelmed but sees no way out of it - except that they do, I gather, start again.

To these non-US eyes, it is very shocking to see the name and photograph of the young man alleged to have been abused by Jackson splashed all over the media -
DF-199-192821-670_8251.5
here, juveniles are protected to the point that, on the few occasions I have accompanied a minor who was raped or sexually abused to court, while she/he gave testimony - if the offender (these were cases where, oddly, a conviction was obtained, so I do not say "alleged" offender) was also a minor, it was a big deal to be allowed in to be a support person for the victim, because I would hear the name of the offender.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.6
What do people think of the US practice?
DF-199-192821-670_8251.7
What is the reason for it?
DF-199-192821-670_8251.8
Which would you prefer?
DF-199-192821-670_8251.9
What do you think is the impact on young people so identified?
DF-199-192821-670_8251.10
ii) The media circus.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.11
Here, both defence and prosecution are very limited as to what they can say about a case that is before the courts. The matter is considered sub judice.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.12
Occasionally, with high profile cases, the police will "leak" things - and/or the media will attempt, within the letter of the law, to try a case in the media (the Lindy Chamberlain case was a terrible example of both these occurrences) -
DF-199-192821-670_8251.13
but the organised propaganda campaigns that I think I detect in the US are not generally present.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.14
Full details are generally releasable only after the trial.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.15
Again, the spectacle is very shocking to these non-US eyes.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.16
I presume it is allowed because of an interpretation of free speech?
DF-199-192821-670_8251.17
Do people think it aids justice? That it is societally positive? What do you think?
DF-199-192821-670_8251.18
iii) This is unrelated - but, do people think this is going to be another black v white case, and do you think that high profile non-Caucasian people still - despite their wealth and power - are unfairly treated in the US justice system?
DF-199-192821-670_8251.19
I would think that, similarly to here, that poorer and obscure people of colour would tend to be - but I am interested in views re people who have achievedfame and fortune.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.20
Judging the US legal system based on what goes on in, say, the Jackson case is probably a bad idea.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.21
I've served on jury duty several times and came away highly impressed with how seriously everybody took their various responsibilities.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.22
A case like Jackson's, alas, or the Kobe Bryant case betray many standards.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.23
The media have some role in this, as do glory-hounding attorneys on both sides.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.24
I'm sure, for example, that a minor's name should never be publicized in a case like this.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.25
I'm trying to pay as little attention to this case as possible, because I think it's more a freak show than anything else.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.26
Please don't judge our system on the basis of the Jackson trial!
DF-199-192821-670_8251.27
We have very strict publication bans around identity of abused minors in Canada.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.28
The person charged often cannot be identified, as their name, and the details of the relationship to the child, would mean the child could possibly be identified.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.29
Sleeping next to the elephant means we've probably become a bit jaded to the circus. But the laws are much tighter here.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.30
I would be extraordinarily happy not to make such a judgment, D'Artagnan!!!! But - it is ALLOWED to happen!
DF-199-192821-670_8251.31
Would the name of the child, for instance, normally be suppressed?
DF-199-192821-670_8251.32
How often do cases become media circuses?
DF-199-192821-670_8251.33
I guess what I am getting at is the different LAWS on such matters...
DF-199-192821-670_8251.34
Interesting to have such differences in the systems of countries that grew so similarly, ehBeth.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.35
We seem much more like you guys - but, I suppose, the US invented its laws after a revolution - we inherited them after centuries of slow evolution with no cataclysm, and made changes slowly.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.36
I think but I'm not completely sure if you can print any name of a sexual abuse victim in Canada without the express permission of the victim.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.37
You cannot print the name of any minor whether the victim or perpetrator of any crime, except in very special/rare circumstances where a minor is at large and a suspected danger to the community or themselves.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.38
A court order is needed in these cases and once the minor is apprehended the name and or picture must not be printed again, ever.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.39
News outlets are rarely allowed to print anything specific in these cases as well.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.40
In cases of family abuse the names are rarely printed, if ever, in order to protect the victim.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.41
I had no idea the victim in the Jackson cases was publicized.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.42
I have seen pictures of his previous victim which I though was pretty appalling but generally the faces have been smudged out.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.43
What I hope will happen here is that people will come along to present the case FOR allowing the names to be made public, because it is incomprehensible to me -
DF-199-192821-670_8251.44
but there MUST be reasons for the US system to be the way it is on these matters.
DF-199-192821-670_8251.45
It isn't as though people in the US are not interested in and critical of their own system - gotta be a reason...
DF-199-192823-675_6015.1
I think they are getting ready to bring the first miner up.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.2
Over 2,000 feet up, in a little tube, through a little tunnel.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.3
On CNN I saw a picture they showed of the faces of the miners, and I saw at least a couple guys that look way too big to fit in that thing.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.4
I guess they'll be sucking in their guts.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.5 ::script amr-snt-id-rep
Wow, 69 days.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.6
That's like a full season of Big Brother.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.7
I guess the whole rescue is supposed to take about two days, if their estimates are correct and nothing goes wrong.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.8 ::script amr-snt-id-rep
And the whole thing will be watched live all over the world.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.9
Here's a place where there are some livestreams if you want to check it out.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.10
Americans could learn a lot from the Chilean people as the 33 miners are rescued.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.11
They came together to support and save the miners' lives.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.12
So much better than the political party fighting going on over the coming elections in the U.S.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.13
I have a question.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.14
The last man, one of the rescuers, must be able to lock the rescue tube's door correctly from the inside?
DF-199-192823-675_6015.15
I can understand how he could hook up the oxygen pack and other devises, but I can't figure out how he can lock the door so it doesn't come loose if no one is there to do it from the outside.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.16
he will have to hold it shut with a handle or maybe a bungee cord held on the inside.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.17
Good question.
DF-199-192823-675_6015.18
Looks like these guys are gonna get out in time to do their Christmas Shopping
DF-199-192823-675_6015.19
I am sorry; but I thought Chili was part of America...
DF-199-192823-675_6015.20
One of them at least...
DF-199-192823-675_6015.21
They come in two's you know...Inner Mongolia, and outer Mongolia...That sort of thing...
DF-199-192823-675_6015.22
In any event, I do not know the answer to your question...
DF-199-192823-675_6015.23
It would seem that for most doors, there is a handle on the inside and the outside...
DF-199-192823-675_6015.24
Just like Hammers have claws so you can go both ways with a nail...
DF-199-192823-675_6015.25
Speaking from experience, it is damned difficult some times not having reverse on a motor cycle...
DF-199-192823-675_6015.26
You can't stop riding without thinking about riding later...
DF-199-192823-675_6015.27
Here I am, and how do I get out..
DF-199-192823-675_6704.1
I'm watching on the telly yet another shooter (Orlando Fla) news says 8 victims taken to hospital.
DF-199-192823-675_6704.2
You know what David is going to tell you in a few minutes: if the others had guns to protect themselves, they all would be dead by now.
DF-199-192823-675_6704.3
That's how gun logic works, my dear dys.
DF-199-192823-675_6704.4
Guess all the gun crazy psychotics are flipping out of the woodwork.
DF-199-192823-675_6704.5
yeah, and then I'm a gun owner.
DF-199-192823-675_6704.6
And your """"enlightened"""" solution is?
DF-199-192823-675_6704.7
my "enlightened" solution is for everyone to determine who might become a potential shooter and kill them before they are able to harm anyone.
DF-199-192823-675_6704.8
Does my sarcasm equate adequately to yours?
DF-199-192823-675_9881.1
I'm talking specifically about the showing of the contents of the package that he sent to NBC.
DF-199-192823-675_9881.2
I realize that this stuff will probably come out anyway, and that the public really REALLY wants to see what was in that package, but isn't it also in a way glorifying/validating the guy's actions and giving him exactly what he wanted?
DF-199-192823-675_9881.3
For instance, the image of him pointing a gun at the camera is on just about every news site I see online, and the video clips of his rantings are starting to show up everywhere as well. And his writing.
DF-199-192823-675_9881.4
I realize how fascinating it is to try to get inside this nutball's head, but is there any way to put the news out there about him without giving him rock star status?
DF-199-192823-675_9881.5
Is it even possible?
DF-199-192823-675_9881.6
I wonder how long until this stuff shows up on murderauction.com or one of those other disgusting sites.
DF-199-192823-675_9881.7
I think there can be details (what happened when, who tried to do what, etc.) without spreading his own propaganda. Because that's what it is.
DF-199-192823-675_9881.8
He stage-managed this -- he wanted the badass stuff out there, he wanted that lasting image.
DF-199-192823-675_9881.9
Just show a small picture of who he was, the original one was fine.
DF-199-192823-675_9881.10
The rest is unnecessary, and articles BBB and nimh have linked to argue convincingly that the propaganda is downright dangerous.
DF-199-192823-675_9881.11
The American public has reached the point in our culture, that the news that gets the most coverage is the news that plays to the lowest common denominator amongst us.
DF-199-192823-675_9881.12
Think about it. For weeks, there was Pamela Anderson and the baby. Then it was Don Imus. Now all we hear about is that murderous nutjob who acted on his sickest delusions.
DF-199-192823-675_9881.13
It is like the newspapers and TV want to beat out the supermarket rags. Ugh!
DF-199-192833-693_9297.1
I've been enjoying the NYTimes blog, primarily by Michael Kimmelman, who I'm used to reading when he writes about art.
DF-199-192833-693_9297.2
But he's joined by several other good writers who are apparently hanging around the US Open typing away as they feel like it.
DF-199-192833-693_9297.3
I like all the different viewpoints.
DF-199-192833-693_9297.4
Have always like Vecsey's writing, but can't read him in the paper lately because he's now in the Times Select group that you have to pay for to get access to, even on the day of the article.
DF-199-192833-693_9297.5
My favorite writer on the blog is Kimmelman, he seems to have my eyes, if I had his.
DF-199-192833-693_9297.6
I'm enjoying the play by play, as it were, so much that I want to see if I can go back and read the blog on the World Cup.
DF-199-192833-693_9297.7
Probably not, as so much time has passed.
DF-199-192833-693_9297.8
Anybody on a2k following this?
DF-199-192833-693_9297.9
Going to the matches?
DF-199-192833-693_9297.10
I do follow international tennis -- one of the first things I want to glance over on the morning newspaper.
DF-199-192833-693_9297.11
Not going to the matches, though?
DF-199-192833-693_9297.12
Well, so are you following the US open (http://www.usopen.org/)?
DF-199-192833-693_9297.13
Who are your fave players?
DF-199-192833-693_9297.14
Yeah, she sure was a tennis prodigy.
DF-199-192833-693_9297.15
She's always lacked the killer serve that is a key to today's power game, though.
DF-199-192833-693_9297.16
If she didn't have it in her heyday, she's not going to have it now in the twilight of her career.
DF-199-192833-693_9971.1
Hey, hope your day is going well!
DF-199-192833-693_9971.2
I have a question for anyone who feels that want to answer.
DF-199-192833-693_9971.3
I have been watching a bit of 'Rhythmic Gymnastics' on YouTube...I just find it amazing...it's very cool.
DF-199-192833-693_9971.4
I don't have children, but when I get to that stage, I'd love a daughter of mine to take part in this really cool sport.
DF-199-192833-693_9971.5
My question though is, is it true or just a myth that while all this crazy flexibility at a young age is nice, at old age they will be in pain and not able to move at all?
DF-199-192833-693_9971.6
If it is true, I'd prefer not to have any part in it, but if it's not true, it would be great to know.
DF-199-192833-693_9971.7
Can anyone help?
DF-199-192833-693_9971.8
I'm no expert, but Nadia Comenechi, the famous Romanian gymnast, has no health problems from her gymnastics days though her former gymnast husband is wracked with arthritis.
DF-199-192833-693_9971.9
Thanks for you quick reply.
DF-199-192833-693_9971.10
Could it be that different people react to it in different ways?
DF-199-192833-693_9971.11
Maybe you just enjoy it while you do, and if you find it painful afterwards...bad luck, if not...GREAT!
DF-199-192833-693_9971.12
Has anyone else got any other thoughts?
DF-199-192833-693_9971.13
I'm not familiar with rhythmic gymnastics, but I know both gymnasts and dancers are prone to on-the-job injury -- and the effects of those injuries can add up.
DF-199-192833-694_0246.1
The behaviour of Australian cricket fans is of more concern than the thousands of spirited Barmy Army members set to descend upon our shores for this summer's Ashes series, say Victoria's police.
DF-199-192833-694_0246.2
The number of English fans travelling to Australia is expected to easily surpass the 10,000 who came for the 2002-03 Ashes series because of last year's victory and because of an online ticketing fiasco that saw thousands of English fans nabbing Ashes tickets meant for Australians.
DF-199-192833-694_0246.3
There has been some discussion here about the Ashes.
DF-199-192833-694_0246.4
Not the test series, the actual ones.
DF-199-192833-694_0246.5
Apparently the Aussies ( a devious lot) have said that when they win the series (that's IF they do, but they don't think that way) they want to take the small urn from its permanent place at Lord's Cricket Ground back to Oz.
DF-199-192833-694_0246.6
MCC say, on your bikes Cobber, because that urn is a gift, not a trophy, and it stays where it is.
DF-199-192833-694_0246.7
What say the Aussies now?
DF-199-192833-694_1052.1
I'm sitting here pulling my hair out because my roomate is watching the Masters on TV. I'd rather drink battery acid than watch golf.
DF-199-192833-694_1052.2
While semi-watching, I just realized something: while the golfer is setting up his shot, and about to swing, all the fans get very quiet for them. Then I thought about fans at sports games(golf isn't a sporting event, it's a hobby), and they scream, yell, and do their best to annoy the opposing team's players and throw them off their game.
DF-199-192833-694_1052.3
Why the hell do golfers escape that aspect? The pressure and ability to block stuff out adds to the challenge. Why are they so special?
DF-199-192833-694_1052.4
This made me just hate watching golf on TV even more.
DF-199-192833-694_1052.5
I love golfing.
DF-199-192833-694_1052.6
Don't understand watching it.
DF-199-192833-694_1052.7
Also don't understand courses that use carts.
DF-199-192833-694_1052.8
None of that new-fangled crap for me.
DF-199-192833-694_1052.9
Walk, and carry your bloody clubs.
DF-199-192833-694_1052.10
so there are others out there other than myself that hate golf and believe its not a sport? thats wonderful!
DF-199-192833-694_1052.11
golf is a sport... an incredibly boring sport...
DF-199-192833-694_1052.12
tennis players get the same 'silent treatment' from spectators -- not exactly sure why...

Hatred of golf is for people with brain deficiencies.
DF-199-192833-694_1052.15
One other thing that must annoy you. In all other sports (yeah, golf is a sport)...there are refs and umps and all that. And the people playing the sports argue with those officials all the time.
DF-199-192833-694_1052.16
In golf...you gotta call fouls on yourself. And golfers do!
DF-199-192833-694_1052.17
There ain't nothing in the world better than golf. (Well...maybe one thing. But even that, you can eventually get enough of. You can never get enough of golf.)
DF-199-192834-659_0640.1

DF-199-192834-659_0640.2
Ever? Yeah, next season.
DF-199-192834-659_0640.3
It's looking like he is out for the year, though depedning on his rehabilitation, he may try to be available for the playoffs.

WE CAN HELP YOU!
DF-199-192834-659_0767.3
Several of us A2K'ers have created a support group to painlessly guide you towards appearing knowledgeable even if, like many of us, you are clueless.
DF-199-192834-659_0767.4
They are called the Wildcard games.
DF-199-192834-659_0767.5
You will need to invest a grand total of 7 minutes. Total. Max.
DF-199-192834-659_0767.6
Please indicate, by noon on Saturday, Jan 8th, your picks on these 4 games:
DF-199-192834-659_0767.7
NY Jets @ Indianapolis Colts
DF-199-192834-659_0767.8
Baltimore Ravens @ Kansas City Chiefs
DF-199-192834-659_0767.9
New Orleans Saints @ Seattle Seahawks
DF-199-192834-659_0767.10
Green Bay Packers @ Philadelphia Eagles
DF-199-192834-659_0767.11
The Jets aggravated me no end in Fantasy Football (Sanchez was my quarterback), so this seems to me a perfectly good reason to pick the Colts, who also aggravated me, but not as much.
DF-199-192834-659_0767.12
I'm placing my faith that the Jet's defense will kick in one more time.
DF-199-192834-659_0767.13
Plus I like it that no one else seems to have faith in the Jets.
DF-199-192834-659_0767.14
Besides this wild card round is just fodder for the real games when the Patriots start playing and ultimately take the whole burrito, (enchiladas aren't classy enough for Tom Brady and the gang).
DF-199-192834-659_0767.15
Instead of a coin toss - and because I know absolutely nothing about football- I'm going to do it by which city I know/like better and see how well I do.
DF-199-192834-659_0767.16
So my picks will be:
DF-199-192834-659_0767.17
New York
DF-199-192834-659_0767.18

Just as an experiment to begin with, but I am fairly competititive in spirit, so if one of my teams makes it to the Super Bowl - I'll watch it instead of the Andy Griffith show marathon and eat me some chicken wings and drink a beer or two.

Is there a prize?
DF-199-192909-666_9414.1
in an article in toronto's "globe and mail" newspaper, John Polanyi, a Nobel laureate and member of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Toronto, recommends that afghanistan farmers be allowed(you might even say "be encouraged") to grow poppies (opium) legally.
DF-199-192909-666_9414.2
he argues that there is a shortage of painkilling medication, particularly in poor, third world countries, and that afghanistan could supply the needed poppies at a lower price than commercially produced painkillers.
DF-199-192909-666_9414.3
i saw the interview he gave on CBC-TV recently and he seems to know what he is talking about.
DF-199-192909-666_9414.4
as he put it : "the afghan farmer has to make a living to feed his - often large - family.
DF-199-192909-666_9414.5
we can force him to produce the poppies illegally and feed into the illegal drug market or we can buy the poppies from him and help provide pain-killing drugs."
DF-199-192909-666_9414.6
as i posted sometime ago, countries such as :france, australia and india are permitted to grow poppies legally for the production of drugs - why not allow the afghan farmers the same privilege ?
DF-199-192909-666_9414.7
have a look at the article and see if you agree with him or not.
DF-199-192909-666_9414.8
The problem with poppy cultivation isn't the growing of the crop itself.
DF-199-192909-666_9414.9
The problem is oversight and marketing.
DF-199-192909-666_9414.10
Opiates have legitimate medicinal uses.
DF-199-192909-666_9414.11
Unfortunately, the product of the papver somniferum plant has far more monetary value on the black market than when sold to legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturers.
DF-199-192909-666_9414.12
Thanks for the article and the background - I read both.
DF-199-192909-666_9414.13
There would be problems though.
DF-199-192909-666_9414.14
The criminal element that currently buy the crop are still going to try and get their hands on it, so the crops would need to be guarded.
DF-199-192909-666_9414.15
That's going to cost a fair bit and probably result in bloodshed.

Kevin Sites touring the world's conflict zones with digital technology that will allow him to blog and transmit images and videos from war ridden areas daily.
DF-199-192909-667_1135.4
One can contact him there, or chat with him live on the website.
DF-199-192909-667_1135.5
Now while I know he's doing it voluntarily and probably for a shootload of money, I have to say I find the idea of such a project odd and somewhat disconcerning.
DF-199-192909-667_1135.6
Will it start a new wave of journalists seeking out the most dangerous situations to sell their goods?
DF-199-192909-667_1135.7
Competition on who can go the farthest?
DF-199-192909-667_1135.8
And will that encourage the sides in conflict to up their performance, so to speak, getting international live coverage straight from the front?
DF-199-192909-667_1135.9
Especially if there will be more and more Keven Sites'es roaming the world?
DF-199-192909-667_1135.10
Thousands of journalists already do seek out war zones, sure.
DF-199-192909-667_1135.11
But this is taking it to a whole new level, I think.
DF-199-192909-667_1135.12
Anyway, I'm confused about how I feel about it.
DF-199-192909-667_1135.13
I will surely look in often to see where he's at and will be curious about the reports and live videos.
DF-199-192909-667_1135.14
It has a voyeuristic element to it, doesn't it?
DF-199-192909-667_1135.15
Ah, what is this world coming to.
DF-199-192909-667_1135.16
And what does the future of journalism hold for us?
DF-199-192909-667_1135.17
Can we control it in any way?
DF-199-192909-667_1135.18
What do you think?
DF-199-192909-667_1135.19
gus, that's what's making me uncomfortable.
DF-199-192909-667_1135.20
it just seems like a stoopid idea to me.
DF-199-192909-667_1135.21

To me, it's a good thing to be able to choose how your going to die when it's for a good cause.
DF-199-192909-667_1135.30
There are incidents where the bastards in charge decide it would be best for a certain reporter to "die in conflict"
DF-199-192909-667_1135.31
Mr. Sites better tread carefully.
DF-199-192909-667_1135.32
Of course, I imagine he'll have quite an entourage and that might ensure his safety from the more devious sorts.
DF-199-192909-667_1320.1
The UN or at least some of the members threaten sanctions.
DF-199-192909-667_1320.2
Sanctions, what sanctions could the UN impose, refuse to purchase the lifeblood of industry"OIL"?
DF-199-192909-667_1320.3
Iraq could on the other hand cut their production and cause the price of that commodity to go through the roof.
DF-199-192909-667_1320.4
Is the threat of sanctions just another instance where the US and the UN is just blowing smoke?
DF-199-192909-667_1320.5
It's blowing smoke as it's the people who will end up suffering from any such move.
DF-199-192909-667_1320.6
If the UN really wants to make a difference, they could threaten to pass a resolution!!!!!

Let me start by saying that I love Morocco.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.2
I've been there a few times in the last 6 or 7 years and have become familiar with its people and customs and geography and unique challenges.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.3
Each time I've visited, I've noticed immense, fast-paced progress, both economically and socially.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.4
Since my first visit there a network of well-built highways has been built, enabling european and internal tourism and commerce to flourish.

Agricultural technology has taken off and enabled farmers to be profitable and efficient, as well as increasing the availability of affordable food to all Moroccans.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.9
My aim for this thread is to periodically discuss new developments and economic initiatives in Morocco as they come about in the news, as well as any other news that is deemed curious or interesting.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.10
I'm interested in Morocco.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.11
I know there are some cells there of folks who want to cause havoc but that is presumably not the whole population.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.12
The country has seemed attractive to me for years.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.13
At the least, I am interested in hearing more about it.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.14
Don, could you be more specific about why Morocco is to be avoided?
DF-199-192909-667_1340.15
This all reminds me of myself sitting at a train station in italy at about 5:30 a.m. one morning.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.16
My husband and I wandered in after buying our train tickets to get cappuccini and dolci before the ride... and shared a table with two tourists from the US.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.17
On my right was a table of what turned out to be moroccan laborers.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.18
My xhub and the tourers were talking away about something and I glanced over at the (moroccans) and we started talking in poor italian, which is how I found out they were from Morocco.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.19
Very polite sleepy early morning nice conversation.. I turned to the others and the lady said, "dear, you musn't talk with them, they are dangerous."
DF-199-192909-667_1340.20
I can't remember what I said, but it was short, succinct.

I haven't been there myself but my 3 sons and a friend went a couple of years ago.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.25
They said a) it was one of the most beautiful places they had been and b) it was the place in the world they had been most hassled and cheated.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.26
I think, too, that as 4 young men travelling together, they were looked upon as a challenge by local youth.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.27
They said there was fighting amongst kids in the street and this seemed to be normal and tolerated.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.28
So it is a society with a very male testosterone-rich style.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.29
The shops run by women were altogether less hassly, more friendly.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.30
One thing they found particularly hard to deal with was other young men attaching themselves to their group and being undislodgeable (a nwe word and it's only 9 am!).
DF-199-192909-667_1340.31
My eldest who is especially friendly and tolerant tried to make friends with these people but in the end they all wanted something.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.32
That can be dispiriting for the open-minded and open-hearted.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.33
But they enjoyed their stay generally, would certainly not avoid it in future.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.34
As for lumping all Islamic countries together as a no go area - what complete nonsense!
DF-199-192909-667_1340.35
As we're going to Turkey and Syria at the end of this month, and expect to have a wonderful trip as independent travellers, I am definitely making a political statement -

I do NOT lump all Muslims together, and believe that 98% are friendly to travellers.
DF-199-192909-667_1340.37
Most are undoubtedly anti-American and anti-Bush, but that is not a sentiment confined to the Islamists.

My engagement ring/wedding ring and other personal ring along with my husband's wedding ring was stolen.
DF-199-192930-650_2141.2
At least we assume so.
DF-199-192930-650_2141.3
We went camping and put them together in the car.
DF-199-192930-650_2141.4
After camping and coming home we searched high and low and could not find them.
DF-199-192930-650_2141.5
We called the campgrounds and the owners said they had cleaned our campsite and did not find anything.
DF-199-192930-650_2141.6
So we had to assume some one stole them.
DF-199-192930-650_2141.7
We did have the car unlocked at times so it is a definate possibility.
DF-199-192930-650_2141.8

DF-199-192930-650_2141.11
Came home, and the basement door had been kicked in.

All they took were wrapped Christmas gifts, and all of my husband's socks.

Will the lithium deposits take away from efforts by Al Gore and others to invest in and invent research and development in improved battery storage for the very young renewable clean energy industry in the U.S?
DF-199-192956-653_5349.8
I dont think that any vast deposits found in one land that barely exists as a state and has almost no industry will be a setup for a despotic regime or a surge of TAliban takeover of provinces within which are these deposits.
DF-199-192956-653_5349.9
SInce much of it lies in the mountainous regions of the West and southwest, these are already the subject of the new campaign against a resurfacing TAliban.
DF-199-192956-653_5349.10
These minerals, especially the Lithium, will need major processing before its in a commercial state for batteries.
DF-199-192956-653_5349.11
Long term development for all kinds of batteries for entire new gizmos (not just blackberries) will be based on better and better lithium cells.
DF-199-192956-653_5349.12
Most of the worlds recoverable deposits lie in south America lake deposits and in our own western North Carolina in vast quartz deposits.

DF-199-192956-653_5360.6
If they fail, there will be across the board cuts.
DF-199-192956-653_5360.7
If they succeed, their plan must pass the House and the Senate with no alterations.
DF-199-192956-653_5360.8
I, too, am skeptical, edgar.
DF-199-192956-653_5360.9

I've said elsewhere that I don't think they're expected to accomplish anything.
DF-199-192956-653_5360.14
They may put out a proposal but it will probably fail in one chamber or the other.
DF-199-192956-653_5360.15
Neither chamber can come to consensus on substantive reforms, imo, and the triggers will be pulled.
DF-199-192956-653_5360.16
The triggers were specifically chosen because each one is desirable to one party and not anethema to the other.
DF-199-192956-653_5360.17
It never was a good idea and only seemed to be a good idea to the morons.
DF-199-192956-653_5360.18
There was never any reason to think that this was going to work, and now that it will not they are going to try to defuse the trigger...but THAT might not work either.

The greatest irony I've seen here at a2k Hawkeye is although I agree with on the statement that the US is an oligarchy or a plutocracy I believe you have foolishly drunk the Kool-Aid to think the Tea Party is genuine in it's pursuit to save the country from "our oppressors" when EVERY move they propose is a basic tenet to strengthen the status quo.

CNN has both Missouri and NC at "100% reporting" but they're still not colored in.

I am shocked that this happened.
DF-199-193268-677_6258.5
I am not unhappy but I am shocked.
DF-199-193268-677_6258.6
The tension and animosity on the street in NC is palpable.

After last night's events in Brussels, it's clear that the UK doesn't want to be a part of the Europe (or just the EU?) anymore.
DF-199-193409-648_7525.2
The continent can cope without the British.
DF-199-193409-648_7525.3
But can the UK go to a prosperous future without the Euro, without the continent?
DF-199-193409-648_7525.4
What alliances are now possible? Just the USA, or the a re-organised Commonwealth?
DF-199-193409-648_7525.5
Where will be the future place of this country among Europe, Russia, China, the USA?
DF-199-193409-648_7525.6
The UK has said "Bye, bye Europe".

I hope they know the meaning of "Auf wiedersehen"!
DF-199-193409-648_7525.8
@Walter Hinteler, I can't remember where I read the analysis, but the conclusion which made sense to me was that currency boundaries ultimately implied federal boundaries.
DF-199-193409-648_7525.9
To be anthropomorphic, the "UK psyche " resists federal union with Europe as evidenced by their original reluctance to join the Eurozone.
DF-199-193409-648_7525.10
This latest decision is symptomatic of that resistance but economic events will ultimately decide whether "resistance is futile".
DF-199-193409-648_7525.11
It's also a sovereignty issue -- and sovereignty is something which the EU has never effectively addressed.
DF-199-193409-648_7525.12
Ever crucial issue is put up for a plebecite, or a vote by nation -- and the population of one or more countries, or the governments of one of more countries, torpedo the deal.
DF-199-193409-648_7525.13
As a "union," it's farcical.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.1
Not too long ago, when Barack Obama campaigned for the presidency, he was all about human rights.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.2
And man did he chastise the Republicans' approach to them.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.3
Time and time again, Obama emphasized (and I'm quoting from memory here) that under his rule America wouldn't lead the world through the example of its power, but through the power of its example.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.4
One of his first acts as president was to announce the shutdown of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, which had come to symbolize the Bush administration's fast, loose, and secretive approach to human rights.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.5
Last week, the Obama administration had a perfect opportunity to act on its rhetoric, to set an example of America's new spirit, to specifically deliver “change we can believe in”.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.6
To understand this opportunity, you have to remember that Guantanamo Bay was just the tip of the iceberg.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.7
The rest of the iceberg, hidden underneath the waterline from public scrutiny and media symbolism, exists a system of CIA prisons in foreign countries.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.8
When the CIA suspects people of connections to terrorism, it snatches them off the streets wherever they live, flies them to those secret prisons, and interrogates them.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.9
Credible reports allege that the CIA uses torture to extract information from them.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.10
( I've written about one of the victims a little over three years ago ).
DF-199-193488-664_4828.11
When some of the victims are trying to pursue their cases in federal court, the Bush administration tried to throw out their cases on a theory about government secrets.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.12
Obama, consistent with the rest of his human rights rhetoric, sharply criticized Bush for it.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.13
But now that Bush's secrecy theory is before an appeals court, Obama is changing his mind.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.14
Without qualifications, he is now sticking to the Bush position that torture victims cannot sue the CIA, because the torture is a state secret.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.15
“Change we can believe in”?
DF-199-193488-664_4828.16
Yeah right.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.17
That is so a year ago!
DF-199-193488-664_4828.18
It's what most politicians would do...but still...sigh.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.19
The hell of it is to whom do we turn.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.20
The Bush and Regan policies that have put us in this position?
DF-199-193488-664_4828.21
We all voted for Obama because of these policies but where do we turn to really gain a government of the people for ALL the people.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.22
Democrat, republican, all I see are crooked politicians who are only interested in thier own gain and screw the rest of us.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.23
Well it wasn't just campaign promises, he repeated it in his inauguration, when he already had the presidency in hand.

"We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals."
DF-199-193488-664_4828.25
Apparently he was missing some qualifiers, so I'll fix it for him:

"We sometimes reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals when it is politically convenient."
DF-199-193488-664_4828.27

DF-199-193488-664_4828.34
The power of propaganda.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.35
Even half-ways intelligent people just automatically repeat this propaganda that's been driven into their heads.

Interesting use of subject/object pronouns.

I never felt obliged to report every screwup made by the previous administration.
DF-199-193488-664_4828.46
There were so many better qualified people to handle that.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.1
When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, partisans of Ronald Reagan claimed he had "won" the cold war.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.2
Although a careful review of the facts will show it was not true, the claim was that the Soviet Union became overextended attempting to keep up with Ray-gun's defense spending.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.3
Pappy Bush, who was the president at the time, claimed that he had won the cold war since the collapse of the Soviet Union happened on his watch.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.4
Regardless of how one views those claims, for many people -- capitalists especially -- heralded the "victory" of capitalism.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.5
Globalism was hailed by its partisans as the natural consequence of their "victory," and the sensible way to bring the alleged blessings of a problematic freedom to the people of the world.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.6
Always impatient of any restaint, capitalists used this so-called victory as justification for the opposition to, or calls for the roll-back of any regulatory restraint.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.7
But not everyone has agreed with that view of the world and of economic systems.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.8
Now, with the various "Occupy" movements, it is (or ought to be) obvious that a great many people are less than enchanted with capitalism and its expression in the idustrial democracies, as well as in the countries into which capitalists from the industrial democracies go to invest.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.9
What are your thoughts on capitalism and its activities?
DF-199-193571-649_0934.10
@Setanta, Unfettered capitalism has yielded an Oligarchy.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.11
Governmental regulation is good for capitalisms evolution.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.12
Health and safety and environmental horrors need to be regulated otherwise industries will not EVER do whats right for humanity.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.13
@Setanta, I don't have a problem with capitalism -- i have a problem with unregulated capitalism.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.14
I agree with this completely.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.15
Capitalism thrives when everyone understands the rules, plays by the rules and enforces the rules.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.16
If everyone has to spend all their time trying to circumvent the rules, understand the rules or fighting against those not following the rules, that is where trouble really begins.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.17
That's the problem with "deregulation".
DF-199-193571-649_0934.18
Removing rules doesn't help business be more competitive, it means that businesses must race to the bottom to counter new businesses that start there.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.19
It's like changing the rules to Monopoly half way through the game so that all the previous purchases are meaningless.
DF-199-193571-649_0934.20
That's not a benefit to capitalism despite what some would tell you.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.1
Out of all of the examples I saw, the only one I would agree with is the bomb toting Arab.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.2
That is extremely rude, though I can see the humor in it.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.3
In a college, that kind of costume should not have a place.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.4
But these kids are listing Geisha costumes, sombreros + donkeys, and a few other costumes that they deem 'racially insensitive'
DF-199-193600-660_5903.5
Racially insensitive?
DF-199-193600-660_5903.6
Have they not been to Mexico?
DF-199-193600-660_5903.7
That is a huge part of their dress when you get farther away from the cities.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.8
How is that being insulting?
DF-199-193600-660_5903.9
It is not showing someone doing something derogatory, it is using the clothes of a society for a costume.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.10
A Geisha is insensitive too.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.11
Again, ( my opinion only) this is taking it way over board.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.12
Sometimes it seems people look for reasons to be offended.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.13
It is about perspective frankly.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.14
There will ALWAYS be someone who sees something and wants to think the worst of it.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.15
Dressing in a costume or NOT dressing in one will not change that.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.16
And why is it that only those races/cultures are the spotlight of being insensitive?
DF-199-193600-660_5903.17
Is it not JUST as rude to wear torn over alls, stained shirt, black out your teeth and be a white hillbilly?
DF-199-193600-660_5903.18
What about the woman who wears shorts, high heels and too much make up to be a hooker?
DF-199-193600-660_5903.19
There has to be a stop to this forever drive to find something insensitive.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.20
And if someone wants to look for reasons they are being held back for what ever reason they have in their heads, they will always find justification no matter what.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.21
But why are we as a so called free society really jumping on board this super PC behavior?
DF-199-193600-660_5903.22
Why is it now ok to find the smallest thing to be offended about and throw it out as the new discrimination?
DF-199-193600-660_5903.23
And why are these rules only applied to two or three races?
DF-199-193600-660_5903.24
Americans, white, black, green, blue, short, tall, fat..
DF-199-193600-660_5903.25
what have you, are ALL being made fun of in some way when it comes to costumes and halloween but only those 3 races get the red light?
DF-199-193600-660_5903.26
Isnt THAT racist?
DF-199-193600-660_5903.27
These students are bleeding idealism and haven't been tempered enough with time and cultural patina to realize that one should be able to laugh at oneself and one's cultural obsessions and that these costumes aren't the evil mechanisms of racism they are betraying them to be.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.28
This is an absolutely ridiculous thread.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.29
I mean if racist costumes were actually being banned, you all might have a point.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.30
I am as uptight about the plight of white people in the US as anyone is.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.31
But did anyone else read the article?
DF-199-193600-660_5903.32
No one is banning Halloween costumes..
DF-199-193600-660_5903.33
No one is even talking about banning Halloween costumes.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.34
In fact no one in this story wants to ban anything, except for the people here who apparently want to ban posters.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.35
These students have a simple goal.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.36
They say "... if we can change a few people or make a few people think, then that's awesome".
DF-199-193600-660_5903.37
They aren't banning anything or stopping anybody from doing anything.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.38
This story is about students expressing free speech.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.39
They are making posters expressing their opinion.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.40
Of course if you want to wear a costume that others find offensive it is free speech.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.41
But me complaining about your costume being offensive is also free speech.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.42
Neither should be banned.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.43
And that is the way it works.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.44
Whether your costume involves black face and a noose, or whether it is a grilled sandwich where I think the cheese is a little too drippy is irrelevant.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.45
Free speech is free speech and expressing free speech is actually opposite of the "banning" that is being alleged.
DF-199-193600-660_5903.46
You all have turned this story on it's end.
DF-199-193694-586_5859.1
SO dear Massachusetters, does she have any chance in dethroning the sitting Republican Senator, Scott Brown?
DF-199-193694-586_5859.2
Why does Scott Brown need to be dethroned? I kinda like him...
DF-199-193694-586_5859.3
Could Elizabeth Warren beat Scott Brown?
DF-199-193694-586_5859.4
i'm not sure what either of them look like, but the most brutal fight i ever saw was a girl fight, lots of kicking, scratching, and some amazing punches (the loser had to stay home from school for almost a week until swelling went down around her eyes)
DF-199-193694-586_5859.5
so i'm gonna say yes
DF-199-193694-586_5859.6
I'm thinking in terms of the Democratic Party getting one more Senate seat.
DF-199-193694-586_5859.7
In Massachusetts, it would seem a lot easier task then in other Senate races.
DF-199-193694-586_5859.8
I'm thinking the best thing to do is keep the few moderate Republicans we have right where they are.
DF-199-193694-586_5859.9
He may vote along party lines for most things but he's reasonable when it comes to representing a liberal-leaning constituency.
DF-199-193694-586_5859.10
Don't know, but it sounds like a real bellweather contest, doesn't it?
DF-199-193694-586_5859.11
It would have made for some really great off year contest.
DF-199-193694-586_5859.12
Care to explain why you think he is an idiot?
DF-199-193694-586_5859.13
He did beat Martha Coakley rather convincingly.
DF-199-193694-586_5859.14
He served as a State Senator for several years.
DF-199-193694-586_5859.15
He even voted for several Dem bills.
DF-199-193694-586_5859.16
Coakley was a bad candidate who ran a terrible campaign - I'll hunt around for a great article I read a year ago outlining the tremendous mistakes she made.
DF-199-193694-586_5859.17
As for Brown, he has a difficult time answering questions about policy in a cogent fashion.
DF-199-193694-586_5859.18
I have seen him on several occasions give answers which show that he has no real understanding of the underlying issue at all, and several which are really just embarrassing.
DF-199-193696-586_5756.1
I haven't really been active in (or even really cared about) politics until recently and I'm really just looking for other peoples opinions on this.
DF-199-193696-586_5756.2
Well, just telling you who I'll vote for probably won't inform you much though right?
DF-199-193696-586_5756.3
What issues are important to you?
DF-199-193696-586_5756.4
Obama because I think he has done a good job in most areas; some areas he let me down, plus there is no way I would vote for a republican today.
DF-199-193696-586_5756.5
(I have a few times in the past, mostly local)
DF-199-193696-586_5756.6
Anyone who is not a Republican.
DF-199-193696-586_5756.7
I think the majority of them are the reason this country has become constipated concerning everything that is important.
DF-199-193696-586_5756.8
They are willing to throw America under the bus in order to make Obama look bad.
DF-199-193696-586_5756.9
OK, "and why" does add a lot, you're right.
DF-199-193696-586_5756.10
I'm voting for Obama because I think he has done a good job in difficult circumstances, and can do much more with another term, and because I really worry about what any of the possible Republican nominees would do as president if one of them won.
DF-199-193696-586_5756.11
I also wouldn't vote for just about any republican (especially Rick Perry) but I have heard some good things about Ron Paul, he's about the only republican that I'm actually interested in learning more about.
DF-199-193696-586_5756.12
My own opinion of Ron Paul is that I'm happy that he's in the race, and especially in debates.
DF-199-193696-586_5756.13
I like how he's anti-war and anti-bullshit in general.
DF-199-193696-586_5756.14
I would absolutely not want him to be president, though.
DF-199-193696-586_5756.15
Andrew Sullivan has a lot of posts on him, that might be a good place to start if you're interested in learning more.
DF-199-193696-586_5756.16
Here's his un-endorsement of Ron Paul (he endorsed him, then had second thoughts):
DF-199-193696-586_5767.1
I read a fascinating piece in the WSJ today.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.2
The author spoke about how Obama's approval ratings are at a dismal low.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.3
He apparently appears to be unable to pull Congress together to accomplish much, and in the author's opinion, it would only get worse if he got elected to a second term.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.4
He would like Obama to bow out for a 2nd term, and have Hillary Clinton run for president.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.5
He believes that Hillary has the best chance of bringing the country together.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.6
I don't know how she feels about running, but, IMO, I think that it is a great idea.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.7
She certainly has the smarts, the experience, and the approval of the majority of citizens.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.8
I think that the people on the Republican side of the fence, are a poor bunch.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.9
There is not a one in the bunch who would capture the imagination of the American people.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.10
The voters who will decide this election, IMO are the moderates and the independents. THEY certainly will not vote for any of the anti-gay, pro-life bible bangers.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.11
What do you think?
DF-199-193696-586_5767.12
Should Obama step down for the good of the country?
DF-199-193696-586_5767.13
Should Hillary run?
DF-199-193696-586_5767.14
Hillary's time has come, and gone...
DF-199-193696-586_5767.15
She would make her self no friend of the Democratic party by dividing them and losing the black vote...
DF-199-193696-586_5767.16
No one is going to vote for her that did not vote for Mr. Obama, and a whole lot less Obama voters will vote for her...
DF-199-193696-586_5767.17
Don't worry though..
DF-199-193696-586_5767.18
She has enough sense to not try to run against a sitting president from her own party...
DF-199-193696-586_5767.19
Best case scenario: Obama gets reelected and the country continues to slide backwards even if the Democrats gain a greater foothold of the US Senate and increase their collective mass in the US Congress.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.20
Worst case scenario: George W. Bush II (any Republican candidate other then Huntsman, Romney, or Ron Paul) will take the election.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.21
Then that means the Republicans would likely further gain in Congress and even the Senate perhaps.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.22
Then the country slides right back into the deepest of recessions.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.23
I suspect you are wrong on the voting inclinations of the moderates, and especially the ones you call tea baggers.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.24
Actually, I think you are wrong on the moderate/independent voter turnout, too, but I could be wrong.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.25
I'm expecting a fairly good anti Obama turnout amongst that group.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.26
I could accept Hillary.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.27
Like Phoenix, I'm not greatly impressed by the Republican field.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.28
Not crazy about the presumed Democratic candidate either.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.29
On the other hand, Obama stepping aside seems even less likely than Cain giving up.
DF-199-193696-586_5767.30
I guess that in summary, I'm not optimistic about the future of the country for the next five years.
DF-199-194088-677_0261.1
Kudos to NY!. They realize that it's not about just voting the party line, it's about voting for what's right.
DF-199-194088-677_0261.2
@jcboy, Did they actually vote for gay marriage yet?
DF-199-194088-677_0261.3
I'm getting a mixed message with the NY Times
DF-199-194088-677_0261.4
@tsarstepan, They sure did!
DF-199-194088-677_0261.5
Hopefully, other states will realize gay marriage hurts nobody.
DF-199-194088-677_0261.6
Look at Massachusetts. They have had it since 2004.
DF-199-194088-677_0261.7
Have you heard of their society falling apart? Of course not.
DF-199-194088-677_0261.8
I think with NY, then CA, it will rapidly spread across the country.
DF-199-194088-677_0261.9
You can't stop this train!
DF-199-194088-677_0261.10
@jcboy, I hope that the US Congress addresses this issue soon and just makes the whole state by state journey moot by making same sex marriage a national law.
DF-199-194088-677_0261.11
@jcboy, You are correct.
DF-199-194088-677_0261.12
Whether one's home state will recognize a same sex marriage from out of state is another matter.
DF-199-194088-677_0261.13
When I studied the Domestic Relations Law of NY, I thought it was a damned INDIGNITY for a government to give permission to citizens to marry.
DF-199-194088-677_0261.14
The citizens created the damned government, their child. David
DF-199-194088-677_0426.1
Did you guys hear about that plane crash that crashed into a helicopter?
DF-199-194088-677_0426.2
I have no idea how that happened.
DF-199-194088-677_0426.3
What do you think?
DF-199-194088-677_0426.4
That is a congested airway, and when you fly under 1000 feet you have no aid from air traffic controllers.
DF-199-194088-677_0426.5
Accidents happen, but this particular area may need additional regulation (such as a minimum altitude requirement for the tourist helicopters).
DF-199-194190-649_6415.1
My husband, our kids, and myself were spending a day out by the oceanside with another couple and their kids, our long-time friends.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.2
At some point we came across a huge fallen tree, and our friend L. climbed on it and started walking up.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.3
Our 11 year-old son followed him, but L. suddenly realized they won't be able to get down that easily.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.4
He turned back and asked our son to get away and down to give him room to get down, too.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.5
Our son stopped but didn't get out of his way at once.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.6
He was having fun, and we had to tell him 2 more times, and then he obeyed.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.7
After that L. got back down, and he suddenly grabbed our son from behind and threw him on the ground with all his might, yelling at him.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.8
We were stupefied.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.9
A 215lbs 38 year old man could have easily injured him.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.10
Fortunately he got up unscathed albeit very frightened.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.11
We are in deep shock, we never hit our children.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.12
Does anybody know if there are legal ways to teach the man a lesson - but not monetary?
DF-199-194190-649_6415.13
Is there any point in filing a police report?
DF-199-194190-649_6415.14
Personally, if someone is my friend, I am going to deal with the situation on a person to person level.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.15
Why can't you make it sure that you were really upset and that you don't want them hitting your kids ever again.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.16
Legally, there are two remedies.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.17
There is monetary damages, and there is jail time.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.18
I suppose you could add probation (but that is just a replacement for jail time).
DF-199-194190-649_6415.19
If you go the legal route, that pretty much ends the friendship no matter what happens.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.20
If I was angry enough to start down this path I wouldn't worry about where it ended up.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.21
I would probably express my feelings on the situation and make it clear that it was not to happen again.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.22
Your son was assaulted.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.23
That is what the behaviour of your ex-friend would be named legally.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.24
He didn't hurt your child physically, so it was the lesser form of assault (assault causing physical harm is seen as more serious.)
DF-199-194190-649_6415.25
You certainly could file a police report....
DF-199-194190-649_6415.26
I don't know the law where you are, here, it is quite likely that police would go around and question the man, making it clear that (if your description is accurate) he had committed an offence, but you could decide against filing charges.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.27
Again, depending on where you live, you could likely notyify child protection authorities.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.28
here, being extra-familial, and given that you have already decided not to expose your child to hm again, they would simply hand it to police.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.29
If you release a legal genie from the bottle, though, you lose control of what the genie does.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.30
For instance, you and your son would need to make a formal statement.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.31
It might be that police act even if you don't want them to.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.32
It might go to court.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.33
I'd personally not choose to do it tthat way...though you could certainly chat to local police without naming names and see if there is such a thing as a stern chat, or a formal caution to be had in your area.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.34
I'd hope that a stern talk from you and the loss of the friendship would be a big message to him.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.35
However, my concern would be how he treats his own kids.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.36
That was one hell of an over-reaction.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.37
If you have evidence that he assaults his own kids, I'd be considering a chold protection notification.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.38
is your kid ok?
DF-199-194190-649_6415.39
That would have been scary.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.40
Is he having nightmares or anything?
DF-199-194190-649_6415.41
I'd also be having a chat with him about his behaviour.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.42
It didn't warrant such a reaction, but he was thoughtless.
DF-199-194190-649_6415.43
If it was really unusual behaviour from your friend, I am a bit worried about him, too, frankly.
DF-199-194209-587_2515.1
I am a 25 year old woman, and I have been in a 2 year relationship with a 37 year old married man.
DF-199-194209-587_2515.2
He has 2 kids one, from his marriage and one from a previous relationship.
DF-199-194209-587_2515.3
He has been planning to get a divorce since the first day we met,
DF-199-194209-587_2515.4
things are so heated between us, I don't know what to do.
DF-199-194209-587_2515.5
He is planning on moving out of the house by the end of the year, he and his wife do not see eye to eye.
DF-199-194209-587_2515.6
He was having sex chats with a lady he met on facebook from Sweden,
DF-199-194209-587_2515.7
when I found out it affected me really badly.
DF-199-194209-587_2515.8
I felt and still feel betrayed and I can't trust him.
DF-199-194209-587_2515.9
How do I let go?
DF-199-194209-587_2515.10
@JEJE, You just walk away.
DF-199-194209-587_2515.11
Do you really think so little of yourself that you believe this is the best you can do?
DF-199-194209-587_2515.12
A married man who if he really was in love with you would just go ahead and file for divorce now, or at least move out of his house now.
DF-199-194209-587_2515.13
A man who while having a relationship with you is involved in sex chats online with others.
DF-199-194209-587_2515.14
Personally, when you mess with a married man you deserve exactly what you get.
DF-199-194209-587_2515.15
I have little or no pity for you.
DF-199-194209-587_2515.16
But, you can do yourself a world of good by just walking away from him.
DF-199-194209-587_2515.17
Then why don't you think about looking for someone who is not attached.
DF-199-194209-587_2515.18

DF-199-194215-653_0484.3
I want to start dating other people and my son's father says if I do he will have nothing to do with his son.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.4
He is very possesive and controlling but he has no right to be as we are not together.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.5
He has too much going on in his life right now and he thinks we can work when I have told him several times I dont love him and he does not love me.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.6
I want him to be there for his son without needing me too.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.7
But he has no one his family and him dont get along and have their own issues.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.8
I don't want to be miserable anymore and the longer he is around the more miserable I will be.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.9
I dont want him to not be there for his son as he is a good father or he at least tries.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.10
I do believe every child needs both parents weather they are together or not.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.11
But he thinks if he cant have me no one can.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.12
What do I do to move on with my life.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.13
Your ex is threatening you using your son... bad, bad, bad.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.14
You can't give in to that or it will just escalate.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.15
You have a right to live your own life and be happy, so don't cave to his threats.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.16
If he really loves his son, he'll see him regardless, but this is just a typical control method that people like him use.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.17
Others say things like, "I'm going to kill myself if you leave me"... get it?
DF-199-194215-653_0484.18
Date.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.19
Meet all kinds of people.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.20
Do what you want.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.21
If the price is, he voluntarily walks out of both of your lives, you're probably better off without him.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.22
I'd agree - one other thing it is none of his business whether you date or not.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.23
I wouldn't tell him.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.24
Not because of his threat - but because your personal life is none of his business.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.25
Can you document his threats?
DF-199-194215-653_0484.26
You really need to.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.27
Quit taking his calls, make him leave voice mail.
DF-199-194215-653_0484.28
Make him email or text you.

Hello I started university in September, didn't immediately gel with it obviously like most people.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.2
However, I knew it would take me some time to adjust, because I have always been very introverted, and shy and especially anxious and all the rest of it.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.3
The first night I was here, all my housemates and I went out and it was the hardest thing I have ever ever had to do.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.4
To go into the SU bar on my own, sober.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.5
Anyways more to the point; Here are the facts:
DF-200-192400-625_6304.6
- I am not enjoying university having been here 5months or so; I'm disillusioned by the course, not enjoying the projects set, and I don't like the course delivery as much.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.7
The University made out it was much better than it seems.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.8
- I had a bad start to the first term; student finance was delayed, adding to my stress levels, I was so worried I was unable to progress with work, conclusively it all piled up.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.9
- I was assigned a counselor through the university; had seen her for about 5-6weeks (block sessions), if I'm honest it didn't really work; because I was never open with her.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.10
Only half-halfheartedly.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.11
- Now the work-load is up to my neck, I have major deadlines to hit, I am depressed, the anxiety is resulting in me feeling miserable all the time.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.12
In no longer have a counselor because you can only have them for so many sessions at a time, and I doubt it will help much this time, if it hasn't already.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.13
- I lack motivation, don't feel comfortable with any of my lecturers, feel like I want to give in, but can't bring myself to it, because I will end up in a dead end job, and I aspired to 'be someone'.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.14
- I would rather be dead than not be educated, and live a life I want to live (and dropping out of uni would make matters worse).
DF-200-192400-625_6304.15
- I'm 21yrs old (turn 22 this year), don't have much time left for failing need to do something.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.16
I failed college once over, did another course so I could get to uni don't want to go through the system over and over and consistently fail.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.17
Can someone please give me some advice please?
DF-200-192400-625_6304.18
Perhaps go and see your doctor, and see if there's any way you can get your deadlines extended to try and ease the pressure a bit?
DF-200-192400-625_6304.19
Send your tutors a similar email to this post (don't worry they've seen it all before - some much more uncomfortable admissions too - I know as I used to work in a Uni Dept admin) and they will consider mitigating circumstances.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.20
Break your work into manageable chunks.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.21
Concentrate on one bit of work at a time (obvs the most urgent assignment first).
DF-200-192400-625_6304.22
Don't shut yourself off from your housemates, and well done for trying new things from the very beginning now keep at it!
DF-200-192400-625_6304.23
I'd reccomend you go and see your doctor too.
DF-200-192400-625_6304.24
If you've always been an anxious person you might benefit from speaking to someone (my friend got therapy on the NHS for anxiety, so its really normal).
DF-200-192400-625_6304.25
And try and get deadlines extended, if you're honest I'm sure your uni will allow it.

I'm not going to pass my A2 exams, I've already accepted defeat, that this year of my life is going to make me a failure.
DF-200-192400-625_6344.11
Maybe I can come back from this, who knows. I've got the most amazing university offers, but I can't even accept them - I'll never make the grades.
DF-200-192400-625_6344.12
I wish I could wipe her out of my life - things would be so much better without her.
DF-200-192400-625_6344.13
But then, I think I'm just being selfish.
DF-200-192400-625_6344.14
But surely, my life isn't meant to be like this?
DF-200-192400-625_6344.15
It should be so much better. B
DF-200-192400-625_6344.16
ut I feel as if I have no control over this downhill spiral.
DF-200-192400-625_6344.17

Thanks for reading.

It's nice to vent.
DF-200-192400-625_6344.20
You can't get her sectioned for that.
DF-200-192400-625_6344.21
Does she even have a history of mental illness or a diagnosis?
DF-200-192400-625_6344.22
You don't know for sure that you won't get good grades so accept places if you can.

I had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for a long 8 years before I came to uni and honestly, the only reason why I'm here is because it was the only way out.
DF-200-192400-625_6344.26
Work hard if you really want out.
DF-200-192400-625_6344.27
Really sounds like you need support from somewhere else if she can't give it to you consistently.
DF-200-192400-625_6344.28
You could call Childline or something similar?
DF-200-192400-625_6344.29
You could go to the library on saturdays and do a good 8 hours of studying there.
DF-200-192400-625_6344.30
Is there a friend's house you could go to- form a study group?
DF-200-192400-625_6344.31
So you want her sectioned cos she is a bit of a pain in the arse and you've blamed all your problems on her?

I think over the last year or 2 i've become a much weaker person and in a way have dulled down my personality inorder to try and make some friends at uni.
DF-200-192400-625_6677.2
But being overly-nice to people has lead them to believe that they can say or do whatever the hell they want to me...
DF-200-192400-625_6677.3
they show absolutely no respect.
DF-200-192400-625_6677.4
e.g. i'll say hello to someone from uni and they'll ignore me, but 30 minutes later they'll decide they want my help with some work... and i'll give it to them.
DF-200-192400-625_6677.5
It's causing alot of anger and distress in my life and is really starting to effect my concentration in uni.
DF-200-192400-625_6677.6
has anyone got any experience in handling this sort of thing or how to go about gaining some respect again?
DF-200-192400-625_6677.7
Just say no.
DF-200-192400-625_6677.8
Do it gradually if it's not something you're particularly comfortable with.
DF-200-192400-625_6677.9
You could start with 'No, sorry but I'm busy'
DF-200-192400-625_6677.10
Of course, don't go over the top with it lest you go in completely the opposite direction.
DF-200-192400-625_6677.11
If, in your mind, you're thinking no - say it.
DF-200-192400-625_6677.12
When they start to realise that you're not going to bend over backwards for them, they'll start respecting you more.
DF-200-192400-625_6677.13
well this is such a bad attitude really, of course you can be respected if you're nice but not to the point where you just let them do anything to you, that's not being nice it's being a fool.
DF-200-192400-625_7046.1
I don't know if anyone will read this, but I just feel desperate and feel the need to tell someone.
DF-200-192400-625_7046.2
This September I left home, and started at University. I was incredibly anxious about doing this, but rather delayed thinking about it until I got here! Now I'm here, and have been for over two weeks, I feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward.
DF-200-192400-625_7046.3
I have been struggling emotionally for the majority of my life since moving to Secondary School, although I did lose my dad at around the age of 9 and always used to blame that for my feelings. I have had two periods of counselling in my life, over roughly 15 months from December 2009 until around March this year.
DF-200-192400-625_7046.4
I feel at the moment like the problems in my life are incredibly overwhelming, and are making me ever more doubtful of my always low self-esteem. I have no ability to concentrate on work, often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions, and doubt myself over anything and everything.
DF-200-192400-625_7046.5
Neither of my counsellers have diagnosed me with depression, and both have suggested I do not suffer from it, but it is a huge worry to me, as depression was the cause of my dad's death, suicide.
DF-200-192400-625_7046.6
I have tried to solve my problems before, and have found exercise and meditation particularly useful, and have also tried things like self-help books and tapes. But my general feeling, is, 'Is this what my life will be? My one chance at existance, my one chance of being a young man, I am wasting it!' And these feelings are beating away at me.
DF-200-192400-625_7046.7
I simply don't know what to do, and when I think of things to do, I never follow through with it. Friends often say I'm lazy, and I can't disagree a lot of the time. I feel like everything anyone could do to help, people have tried, and time and time again I fail.
DF-200-192400-625_7046.8
Sorry to anyone whose read this jumbled mess, and I feel a bit like a self-seeking moaner, but I truly do feel desperate.
DF-200-192400-625_7046.9
Its not uncommon for people's existing feelings about themselves to become more intense when they are in new situations and feel the pressure to socialise with strangers and fit into new roles, i.e. being a university student.
DF-200-192400-625_7046.10
I am not a health professional and I can only speak from personal experience which is why I strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about your feelings and worries about depression.
DF-200-192400-625_7046.11
Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to uni- you're definitely not alone there. But I would really recommend that you get an appointment with your uni counselling services. It doesn't really matter whether anyone has told you that you are depressed or not, you are obviously having some problems at the minute and could use some support- labels aren't as important as your experiences. Meditation and exercise are really helpful, so definitely try to do those. But yeah, you will have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere- but don't beat yourself up about feeling unmotivated to do anything at the minute, lots of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better. Being unkind to yourself will only make you feel worse- be kind to yourself and get some help.
DF-200-192400-625_7046.12
Good luck.
DF-200-192400-625_7046.13
I think a lot more people feel the same way as you do, but medicate themselves by using friends. Whilst it probably isn't a 'solution' as such, being around friends whilst being depressed is definitely better than being alone and being depressed. Either way, if you fancy a chat, feel free to PM
DF-200-192400-625_7046.14
If i were you id focus on an idol. Someone you aspire to (not want to be them but someone who your admire and have respect for) e.g. someone who came from a bad background and ended up successful and happy with a family and married etc etc
DF-200-192400-625_7046.15
Focus on what you want to achieve in life, you havent stated what your studying, or indeed why....is it because you wanted the experience? Because your mum wanted yo to go? Because u need a degree for the career you want to do?
DF-200-192400-625_7046.16
Either way, sum up why youre there and work your bottom off to get the best grades you can, cos once you get ur degree, you wil have something you can say "hey i didnt fail, it was hard work and i passed"

I'm pretty much non-autistic (not diagnosed with dyspraxia but I think the doctor misdiagnosed), but I walk on my toes nearly all of the time.
DF-200-192400-625_7200.2
It's more comfortable to me.
DF-200-192400-625_7200.3
What made them decide toe-walking is a sign of autism since it seems so random and isn't always indicative?
DF-200-192400-625_7200.4
Well I might have signs of something on the autism spectrum but who doesn't have one or two?
DF-200-192400-625_7200.5
You guys know what I mean.
DF-200-192400-625_7200.6
Walking on toes can be a symptom of autism.
DF-200-192400-625_7200.7
Having a headache can be a symptom of brain tumours.
DF-200-192400-625_7200.8
Feeling tired a lot can be a symptom of leukaemia.
DF-200-192400-625_7200.9
Symptoms don't always apply but if they happen in a lot of cases (which it clearly must do in this instance) it's worth noting, since otherwise nothing would ever get diagnosed.
DF-200-192400-625_7200.10
I used to walk on my toes, but that was because I was born with strange toes that curled under and had to be straightened with surgery two years ago.
DF-200-192400-625_7200.11
My brother's autistic but I haven't noticed this with him either, but the spectrum is so broad and I myself probably have mild asperger's because I have problems with communication and don't pick up on social reactions/body language.
DF-200-192400-625_7200.12
But then I don't have a proper diagnosis and even having some symptoms might not mean you have a certain condition.
DF-200-192400-625_7200.13
I walk on my toes not as much since years of being told not to.
DF-200-192400-625_7200.14
I have dyspraxia.
DF-200-192400-625_7200.15
So maybe you are dyspraxic or have short tendons.

Are you on any drugs or getting any therapy?
DF-200-192400-625_7557.24
It might be an idea to talk to your school nurse or your GP and tell them what's going on.
DF-200-192400-625_7557.25
Perhaps there's a teacher at school who you trust and could tell.
DF-200-192400-625_7557.26
If you tell people they can help you,
DF-200-192400-625_7557.27
if you keep it bottled up inside it's likely to only get worse.
DF-200-192400-625_7557.28
Trust me, it's better to get these things as early as possible rather than let them get even worse.
DF-200-192400-625_7557.29
Please don't do this,
DF-200-192400-625_7557.30
I'm 17 I started self harming last year, mainly cutting my arms, but I have stopped since the last few months,

its hard but you can do it.
DF-200-192400-625_7557.32
I feel so much happier, but seeing the scars is both a painful reminder of how I felt at that time, how strong my feelings were that I would want to do such a thing to myself!
DF-200-192400-625_7557.33
And, also strength, you can do it, I found salvation in poetry writing and keeping a journal,
DF-200-192400-625_7557.34
self harming is addictive, but you can overcome it,
DF-200-192400-625_7557.35
remember your self harming does not define who you are.
DF-200-192400-625_7557.36
You can overcome it.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.1
So I think Ive got a form of OCD because for the past year, I've found that everytime I go out, especially to Uni, I'm always checking my belongings to make sure I haven't lost or left anything.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.2
I often have to check twice at one go, then after 30 seconds for some reason I cant resist checking again!
DF-200-192400-625_7744.3
Why is this!?
DF-200-192400-625_7744.4
Am I going crazy or something?
DF-200-192400-625_7744.5
It happens most often when I'm carrying many things, but that is rarely and even still daily I'm checking many times. And is this OCD to any extent?
DF-200-192400-625_7744.6
What can I do about this?
DF-200-192400-625_7744.7
If I don't check, I get very very anxious, which does sort of go away after 15-30 mins, but often the anxiety is so much that I can't wait that long.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.8
I feel if I lost my wallet or phone, then I'm doomed or so I feel.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.9
I just wish I could go out without worrying every 2 mins whether I've left or lost something.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.10
I really dont know what to do, and am afraid of going to the GP.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.11
They've probably never heard of some compulsion like this and I just dont know what to do
DF-200-192400-625_7744.12
Do any of you have a similar 'ritual'?
DF-200-192400-625_7744.13
People would think I'm crazy, but it's very strangely difficult to get yourself out of this.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.14
What advice could you give me?
DF-200-192400-625_7744.15
I used to do this on my way to college-I had a list of items I knew I had on me and used to check compulsively on the bus.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.16
I now have more severe anxiety and think this was just a warning sign so just try and wean yourself out of the habit while it's relatively fresh-definitely visit your doctor but also tell yourself not to keep checking these things (easier said than done I know).
DF-200-192400-625_7744.17
Doctors will have seen much worse cases so don't worry about that!
DF-200-192400-625_7744.18
I did about OCD in psycology today :P
DF-200-192400-625_7744.19
To get rid of it, one way could be just to avoid the compulsive act so don't check to see whether you have lost something, just leave it (:
DF-200-192400-625_7744.20
Even though your anxiety levels would increase for a duration, they will gradualy decrease so hopefully, overtime your OCD will disappear (:
DF-200-192400-625_7744.21
To me that just sounds like you being overly anxious, as opposed to having really bad OCD.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.22
I am very obsessional to the point where I get up 20 times a night to check the locks in my house are all locked a particular way.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.23
Sometimes although I know they're locked I'm convinced they're not.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.24
I think it becomes a real problem when the obsession starts to really interrupt your everyday routine.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.25
You definitely aren't crazy though don't worry and your GP will be understanding of the issue I'm sure.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.26
I go to therapy (for other reasons also) and they have encouraged me to pick a number of times to check, obviously that is less than 20, and to stick to it and cut down that way.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.27
I think the idea is to teach me, I'm still 'okay' if I check 5 times or 20 times.
DF-200-192400-625_7744.28
So far I have been a lot better, I think there is definitely hope of improvement for anyone that wants it.
DF-200-192400-625_7806.1
Usually I'm pretty calm about things and like to take things as they come and not to worry too much.
DF-200-192400-625_7806.2
However, over the last month or two I've found myself becoming really anxious about things, and I'm not talking about a mere out of the blue feeling of nervousness.
DF-200-192400-625_7806.3
I have begun to feel irrationally panicky about a variety of things which beforehand wouldn't worry me too much or even cross my mind as something to cause alarm bells to ring in my head.
DF-200-192400-625_7806.4
I'm not sure if it's the change in lifestyle (going from care-free student to unemployed graduate) that is causing this or if it's a sign of other issues, but it's beginning to bug me as it's affecting my confidence and happiness.
DF-200-192400-625_7806.5
I've spoken to a few people about it including my parents but they all think the same: that I'm going through a random phase and that I should hold off taking action until it is clear that it is a serious problem
DF-200-192400-625_7806.6
So was wondering what's the best thing to do?
DF-200-192400-625_7806.7
Speak to a doctor about it and see if anti-anxiety pills could take the edge off of things?
DF-200-192400-625_7806.8
See if I can speak to a counsellor?
DF-200-192400-625_7806.9
Or should I take the advice given by the close people around me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem?
DF-200-192400-625_7806.10
Well I woudnt try to keep an eye on ur anxiety for a start because that will make u tense and more likely to become more panicky (circle of demise there)
DF-200-192400-625_7806.11
what I would try to do is focus on something that is garunteed to make you smile or feel happier as soon as you start to feel a bit panicky about anything.
DF-200-192400-625_7806.12
Or if u cant do that-when you start to feel panicky, get one of your friends to make you laugh (it works for me and i suffer from random panic attacks lol
DF-200-192400-625_7806.13
This started happening to me, where I'd just start being really anxious over tiny things, although from the sound of things, not as severely as you.
DF-200-192400-625_7806.14
What I find helps is just talking about what is making you anxious to someone else.
DF-200-192400-625_7806.15
Perhaps not in a moany way but I found that mentioning the thing that I was worried about to my mum and seeing her react to the situation in a calm way (like I should have been reacting) made me feel better about it because I knew it wasn't a big deal and I didn't need to be anxious about it.
DF-200-192400-625_7806.16
However, if it gets worse, then yes, go to the doctor's.
DF-200-192400-625_7806.17
I have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that can prevent her from leaving the house and doing things because she's so worried about what can go wrong.

The doctors gave her medication and it's made her much better.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.1
I'm very close to breaking point,
DF-200-192403-624_9834.2
i've loved the same girl for about six years.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.3
I've kept it to myself forever, then told a friend a few months ago cause I just couldn't cope anymore.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.4
Then a week 1/2 ago, I declared my love for the girl in a text when I was drunk.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.5
She eventually replied a couple of days later being unbelievably kind about it, which has really just made me fall even deeper (if this is possible).
DF-200-192403-624_9834.6
I told her she wouldn't hear from me for a while, you know, so I can attempt to move on.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.7
So now I'm at the start of the move on phase, but I'm just stuck.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.8
I cut off most of my hair and I've started exercising and changing my diet to try to alter the chemicals in my body to make me feel better that way, but doesn't seem to be working, i'm still miserable.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.9
A song about love will come on my itunes (pretty much every song in the world) or a song that reminds me of her, and i'll just break down.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.10
I feel like just dropping out of uni and getting on a flight to australia and never coming back.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.11
During a really low point last week I cut myself (which i hadn't done in years) just because i had so much pent-up emotion, i had to let it out somehow.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.12
I really don't know what to do or how to help myself be happy again.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.13
People say time is a healer but I don't know if I'll be able to hold out that long!
DF-200-192403-624_9834.14
Find activities to occupy your time.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.15
There has to be something you really enjoy doing?
DF-200-192403-624_9834.16
Set some goals for yourself. i.e.:
DF-200-192403-624_9834.17
- Go to the gym 5 times a week for an hour a day.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.18
- Read x books in a month.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.19
- Platinum all the God of War games.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.20
- Meet one new person a day and engage in a meaningful conversation.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.21
- Learn a new skill (could be playing an instrument, drawing, trying a new sport, web design, etc.).
DF-200-192403-624_9834.22
Just some examples.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.23
Find an activity you like, set some goals, stick to them.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.24
The key is to occupy yourself and meet new people.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.25
Maybe make a new playlist on itunes for starters, with happy music. 'Don't stop' by Fleetwood mac, etc.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.26
Things that don't make you think of her.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.27
Try, like /\ /\ suggested, getting a hobby, going to the gym etc.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.28
It won't be easy, but it's just one of these things in life.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.29
Try counting all the things that you do have in life,
DF-200-192403-624_9834.30
sure you might not have her, but I'm sure you have a number of other things.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.31
You're in uni arn't you??
DF-200-192403-624_9834.32
Well, a large percentage of the population don't have that, and I'm sure you can finish the list.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.33
It might seem impossible at the moment, but pick yourself up and live life with as much energy as you can.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.34
Talking to people on here is always a place to start, have made some wonderful friends on here
DF-200-192403-624_9834.35
Turn to religion.
DF-200-192403-624_9834.36
When I was in your exact same position I turned to religion and Islam has worked very well boosting up my self-content.
DF-200-192403-625_0024.1
I really like this girl and she's in a few of my classes at university.
DF-200-192403-625_0024.2
Everytime i look at her i find her looking banck at me.
DF-200-192403-625_0024.3
Regardless I don't know her that well but i fancy her a lot.
DF-200-192403-625_0024.4
I was going to ask her out but for the past few weeks i've been waiting for the right time ( which never comes, partly coz i'm scared).
DF-200-192403-625_0024.5
But being valentines day, should i ask her out and give her a card, or would that be cheesy.
DF-200-192403-625_0024.6
Maybe i should just wait for valentines to go.
DF-200-192403-625_0024.7
I see her tomorrow and i could approach her.
DF-200-192403-625_0024.8
I sometimes worry what her mates will think of me, i don't know i'm nervous but it has to be done so i can move on i guess
DF-200-192403-625_0024.9
Forget about the friends; if she's a nice girl, go for it!
DF-200-192403-625_0024.10
Be casual, as you run the risk of coming on too strong if you do anything seriously Valentine's-y.
DF-200-192403-625_0024.11
I would suggest waiting until Thursday or so (let the V-day aura float by a bit), and then ask her if she's got plans Sunday afternoon for coffee.
DF-200-192403-625_0024.12
Low pressure, maximum talking time.
DF-200-192403-625_0024.13
Good luck!
DF-200-192403-625_0024.14
Well, in my estimation, while it is "romantic" to ask on Valentine's day, it's also high-pressure.
DF-200-192403-625_0024.15
It's your decision, obviously.
DF-200-192403-625_0024.16
Either way, coffee date (or something similar.)
DF-200-192403-625_0024.17
And do ask!
DF-200-192403-625_0024.18
Ask as soon as you can manage to get it off your chest.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.1
Asked my girlfriend what fantasies she wants to indulge in, turns out she wants to have a threesome with a lesbian/bi friend of hers that's wanted to **** her for ages.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.2
And yes the third party is fit and has let my gf touch her before.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.3
My girlfriend is straight but she gets a kick out of pleasuring people, if that makes sense.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.4
I'm really kind of split on the issue tbh, I don't have much experience with this sort of thing, if I was in a no-strings relationship they would be no stopping me, but I can't help feeling that going through with it would spoil things between us.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.5
But then again we're young and it is something I'd like to kick off the bucket list, as it were.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.6
Anyone have any experiences with this before?
DF-200-192403-625_0034.7
Good or bad?
DF-200-192403-625_0034.8
What should I look out for/ be careful of, really don't want to ruin things with my girlfriend, but the idea of a threesome is thrilling, not gunna lie.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.9
Not really, threesomes in relationships can really cause issues,
DF-200-192403-625_0034.10
not to mention the reality is oft very different from the fantasy.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.11
Im sexually open minded but theres no way id share my gf with a boy or girl.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.12
If im single yeah sure, attached no way.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.13
If my gf suggested it id tell her no, straight out.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.14
Sorry but i dont share.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.15
Oh and ive had threesomes before someone says it - both MMF and FFM
DF-200-192403-625_0034.16
If you aren't planning on being with this girl forever then go for it.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.17
If you're engaged or some **** then best not to.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.18
If her friend has wanted to 'f**k her for ages' I doubt it will end well
DF-200-192403-625_0034.19
Apparentley threesomes can really ruin relationships, as they can make people insecure and unconfident.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.20
Fantasy is sometimes better than reality.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.21
If you have any insecurities at all, then I would recommend you not do it.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.22
Like people have said, in theory, it's great.
DF-200-192403-625_0034.23
In reality, things are a lot more complicated.
DF-200-192403-625_0111.1
I've been with my girlfriend for well over a year now, and I'm quite selfless towards her.
DF-200-192403-625_0111.2
I do everything I can to make her life easier and better, and we both love each other.
DF-200-192403-625_0111.3
It means that I spend generously if needed and put a lot of time and effort into the relationship.
DF-200-192403-625_0111.4
However, the other night, I brought up "the future".
DF-200-192403-625_0111.5
As in, thinking about where we'd be a couple years from now and how serious she was about staying with me.
DF-200-192403-625_0111.6
Turns out, that she didn't really like me that much when we started dating and she was just seeing how things went (although now she says she is very happy, but surprised, that she has stayed with me this long).
DF-200-192403-625_0111.7
I asked her what she thought about where we'd be and she said she doesn't want to think about that, and that I should be happy about the experiences we've had (which I am).
DF-200-192403-625_0111.8
My issue is that, should I continue putting so much effort into her if it just seems like I'm "what's good right now" for her, although it seems as if she doesn't want to make any plans or even hope to stay together for a long time.
DF-200-192403-625_0111.9
It just seems unfair that I'm putting in a lot more effort into this relationship and that if we did break up, she'd have gained a lot more than I did as a result.
DF-200-192403-625_0111.10
Any thoughts?
DF-200-192403-625_0111.11
In your situation I would say enjoy the moment you're in now.
DF-200-192403-625_0111.12
Currently I'm on the fence in regards to getting more serious with a guy who is technically still married, has two children and has openly told me does not want to get married again or have any more kids.
DF-200-192403-625_0111.13
If you ever find yourself in a situation like this thinking about the future early on is a must in my opinion because there is a lot more at stake.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.1
My boyfriend has one of those jobs where he's on call a lot.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.2
This year he's on call for our anniversary.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.3
This happens a lot.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.4
He said we'll not make reservations but we will make plans etc but not to bank on it.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.5
I'm not angry at him- I'm in uni and I know how it is for things to change suddenly.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.6
But I need to find a way to cope with this.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.7
If I get all dressed up and sit waiting, he often texts me saying he has to cancel.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.8
The disappointment is horrible.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.9
If I don't get ready, he comes home and I'm in my pjyamas, not showered or ready in anyway.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.10
It ruins the night because I have to run around and get ready and I don't get to do any of the things I wanted to.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.11
Is there anyway to
DF-200-192403-625_0370.12
Bless you I know where you're coming from.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.13
My boyfriend is a bobby so he often has to stay late because of a job, he's been hours and hours before getting back.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.14
It makes it harder because we're in an LDR so we have little time together anyway and with me at uni and him with only two days off a week now in comparision to the three/four it's hard.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.15
I don't think you can not get disappointed.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.16
The job demands it.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.17
I realise that and sounds like you do too but it doesn't make it any easier.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.18
It's just something we have to deal with.
DF-200-192403-625_0370.19
Value the moments you do get to spend together, try not to plan things in advance if things are likely to cancel but be prepared for a bit of spontaneity, maybe have an outfit already in your head you could wear at last minute?
DF-200-192403-625_0370.20
It's frustrating, you're not alone in feeling the way you do.
DF-200-192403-625_0594.1
I'm studying abroad for a year and my boyfriend is going to come visit me a few times times.
DF-200-192403-625_0594.2
Should I pay for some/half/any of his plane ticket?
DF-200-192403-625_0594.3
I feel bad when I have all this spare loan money and he's having to save up for weeks to come see me, which is something we both want.
DF-200-192403-625_0594.4
What do I do?
DF-200-192403-625_0594.5
I'd discuss it with him -
DF-200-192403-625_0594.6
I didn't do abroad, but when my ex and I were apart he'd pay for his tickets and I'd pay for everything whilst he was staying at mine -food, transport etc (when he let me anyway).
DF-200-192403-625_0594.7
So really it depends on how much the tickets are costing.
DF-200-192403-625_0594.8
I guess as he's having to save up that living costs wont cover it.
DF-200-192403-625_0594.9
I'd suggest either half, or if it makes him feel less bad about it, alternate - so he pays for the first trip, you pay for the second etc.
DF-200-192403-625_0594.10
When I lived abroad my boyfriend at the time would pay for his flights
DF-200-192403-625_0594.11
(they weren't much luckily) and I would pay for most of the stuff when he was there; eating out...etc.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.1
So my life's been quiet now for a pretty long length of time...
DF-200-192403-625_0945.2
i'v had the occasions of seeing guys, but it never ends good or lasts long.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.3
Since november last year i havn't been in a proper relationship and life's getting a bit too quiet for my liking.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.4
I can't seem to meet any new genuine guys.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.5
Their all 'manwhores' to put it bluntly.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.6
Some that i meet, i'll be physically attracted to them..but they have no personality to them..you could say their like male barbie dolls.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.7
However, some i will meet who have such a lovely personality, but i wont be attracted to them physically.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.8
I can't seem to find someone with that 'connection' if you know what i'm saying.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.9
Im starting to feel like it's me who is the problem.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.10
I can't seem to find anyone who isn't just interested in sex...
DF-200-192403-625_0945.11
advice please!?
DF-200-192403-625_0945.12
Use your gold digger ability and find a rich man.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.13
Meh i have the same problem just in reverse.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.14
It does get a bit demoralising sometimes when everyone around you is in a relationship, especially now which is probably the worst time of year to be single.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.15
I wouldn't blame yourself though, you probably just haven't had an opportunity come along.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.16
I've met plenty of nice girls at uni but it takes a lot for me to actually develop feelings for someone, and i can't say i've met anyone who i genuinely have feelings for.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.17
I'd rather wait until i do then find a girlfriend for the sake of it - try and think of things that way?
DF-200-192403-625_0945.18
Just have to keep putting yourself out there i guess, if you're constantly meeting new people or getting better acquainted with people you already know, an opportunity will come up eventually.
DF-200-192403-625_0945.19
Theres a fair chance you've caught someones eye already and they're keeping quiet about it
DF-200-192403-625_1024.1
So me and my ex broke up about 2 and a half months ago.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.2
Don't know how it all happened but she said she'd like to see me during the Christmas holidays.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.3
Now I had this weird thing going on with this breakup.. for the first 2 weeks I felt totally heartbroken, then I was getting on good for a while, then went back to being really sad, etc.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.4
Before I came back I felt like I was over it; then I came back, and suddenly, yet again feel unhappy.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.5
It's really goddamn annoying.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.6
Either way, from what I've heard, she isn't really the same kind of person she was when we were together (in a good way for me; apparently like the kind of girl I'm not interested in), so meeting with her might totally kill whatever residual feelings there are and I can get on with my life.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.7
Or it won't work and I'll spiral back into sadness.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.8
Or we may get back together, since she told me she might feel differently in the future. (ie, want me back, after a break that's less 'stressful'; not that we ever had a stressful time.. ).
DF-200-192403-625_1024.9
I don't think this is ideal, but I'm an idiot. I know I still feel kind of possessive over her..
DF-200-192403-625_1024.10
I hate the thought of her with another guy.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.11
So should I meet with her? Or not? Or delete her out of my life entirely? or what..
DF-200-192403-625_1024.12
depending on what you want.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.13
if you want her back, do it.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.14
if you want to be over her, don't go.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.15
I would say 90% chance that will end up feeling even more sad than you are if you go see her, coz feeling don't just die in 2 months (unless there was nothing at the start).
DF-200-192403-625_1024.16
I met up with my ex after 2 years of no contact at all and still feelings came back.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.17
so yeah, don't fool yourself. whatever that girl is doing now is probably just a pretend, trying to move on, be a changed person, ect ect.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.18
Don't expect to feel nothing when you see her.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.19
ok its very important to know this quote : "Once a girl leaves her boyfriend, the only reason she might wanna be back is to hurt her bf"
DF-200-192403-625_1024.20
Dude, don't meet up with her even if you love her to death because once you have broken up, there is no way back and all this meeting will do to you is to make you feel upset afterwards.
DF-200-192403-625_1024.21
I was in the similar situation couple of momth ago and i just kept this girl away from me and you ought to do the same since once something is over, then it is OVER
DF-200-192403-625_1037.1
I really need advice.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.2
Me and my boyfriend started dating when we were 16, and we're now at uni still going out.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.3
He's always been the sweetest guy, I mean really nice and funny but these past few months things have changed.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.4
He's had problems at home lately, and things have been really tough for him.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.5
Im surprised how well he dealt with it all.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.6
But recently I've learnt not to bring it up in conversation or he'll get really angry about it.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.7
I don't want to go into details but lately he's been getting agry at the slightest things, and if I can't calm him down he'll get violent especially after a drink.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.8
He'll always laugh it off afterwards as if he didnt mean it, and I know he doesnt because he is a good guy.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.9
I've tried talking to him about it several times, telling him I'll leave him if he does it again but it hasnt stopped, and he has such a hold on me I dont think I could never leave him.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.10
Im so emotionally drained and dont want any friends to know because they'll just think bad of him, when really he is good deep down.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.11
Sorry for the rambling, I just needed to get that out.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.12
I'm posting anonymously because what I am going to say is very personal.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.13
Just over two years ago my girlfriends step-father was hurting her mum.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.14
My girlfriend went to help her mum and in turn was hit over the head by a glass bottle. As you might expect the police were called and the prick was arrested.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.15
He appeared in court the next day and plead not-guilty to assaulting her mum and assaulting her to her injury (serious assault in scotland).
DF-200-192403-625_1037.16
Now this is where my story gets really sick.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.17
I type this and I am full of rage.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.18
My girlfriends mum writes to the court and asks for her husbands bail conditions to be dropped as well as for the charges to be dropped.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.19
She tells the court NOT to write to her at her own address or phone her home - this stopped my girlfriend from finding out what her mum was up to.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.20
In Scotland, domestic abuse charges are not dropped if a victim requests for them to be dropped.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.21
Though the bail conditions were dropped by the High Court in Edinburgh - this allowed the cowardly little prick to contact my girlfriend, her mum and enter the family home.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.22
We found this out on December 23rd 2009 at about 7.30pm when her mum phoned her to say her husband was back in the house and wanted to talk about what happened.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.23
We phoned the police because as far as we were aware bail conditions were still in place.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.24
There was nothing they could do.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.25
Her mum kicked her out on Christmas Eve 2009 to allow the prick to stay.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.26
I was raging.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.27
Seeing my girlfriend in tears at 16 years old was absolutely heart-breaking for me.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.28
I did not know how to help but all I did was worry and worry.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.29
My behaviour started to change, I had recently started a career in the Merchant Navy but due to stress I started to develop problems.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.30
I was eventually referred to a psychologist by my GP to deal with anxiety.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.31
When the case went to trial, her mother lied and said my girlfriend attacked him.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.32
The **** was found not-guilty.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.33
My girlfriend was heart broken.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.34
I lost it, I went absolutely crazy.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.35
If my mum had not calmed me down then I would be in prison just now.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.36
Two years on and my girlfriend has forgiven her mum.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.37
They live in a flat and the mum disappears at the weekend - 10 points if you can guess who she goes to see.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.38
I HAVE NOT FORGIVEN HER MUM.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.39
I do not visit the flat when her mum is in.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.40
I have had arguments with her mum where I have said some absolutely vile things which I am not in the least bit proud about.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.41
I have asked my girlfriend to stay with her dad as I still worry.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.42
Basically me not liking her mum affects our relationship a little bit - if we were ever to take the next step and eventually get married then I do not know how we would do it, though my girlfriend assures me that we would manage somehow.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.43
I still think about the incident a lot.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.44
What I am trying to say is that domestic abuse does not just affect you - it will affect everyone you care about.
DF-200-192403-625_1037.45
Please take what I have said to heart and leave this guy.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.1
Been with a guy for over 3 years.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.2
He's been acting really weird recently.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.3
He hasn't picked up literally 7/8 of my calls.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.4
Hasn't returned any texts either.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.5
I did get to speak to him the last time I rung him (after him blanking 7/8 calls) and I asked him what's up but he didn't tell me (this was over a month ago).
DF-200-192403-625_1231.6
The fact that its a long distance relationship doesn't make it any better.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.7
He did this before once two years ago as well over nothing but I can't really remember how it proceeded...i guess he just gradually starting calling again.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.8
Apart from this, we have had a very loving and almost perfect relationship.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.9
I'm starting to lose trust in him now.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.10
I don't know if I'm overreacting, but I just feel really hurt about the way he's neglecting me again and I'm literally crying as I write this.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.11
I let him get away with it last time but I've had enough.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.12
I don't know what I aim to achieve writing this on a student forum, but any ideas on what should I do? is it worth ending the relationship?
DF-200-192403-625_1231.13
I don't wanna ring him any more because I feel insulted that he just casually blanks my calls.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.14
And asking him doesn't help either since he's not gunna tell me.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.15
Hmm...good few issues here.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.16
Personally, I don't think long-distant relationships would be successful.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.17
The playing hard to get, in reflection to what others have said, is clearly not to way to go, since you're already living far from each other already.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.18
I think that there's a range of possibilities as to why he's acting this way:
DF-200-192403-625_1231.19
1) He's got something to hide.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.20
If you're saying he acted this way before about 2 years ago and then perfectly fine later on, there's clearly something going on in his mind.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.21
I don't know if that's cheating or if there's something else, but there's clearly something he's not sharing with you
DF-200-192403-625_1231.22
2) He's fed up with the relationship.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.23
3) He's autonomous and needs a LOT of space.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.24
I'm exactly the same.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.25
Even if it's a long distant relationship, sometimes receiving phonecalls (depending on how often you'd call him) could actually affect his perception on how he feels about the relationship.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.26
I think if you were to give him a 'taste of his own medicine' then effectively you might receive the response you're expecting but I think what's missing here most is communication.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.27
When you see him next time, don't criticise or start questioning him.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.28
Just express your worries to him and maybe you'll get something out of him.
DF-200-192403-625_1231.29
Edit: I don't understand the neg.
DF-200-192403-625_1270.1
Ok so I am female and like males, always have, obsessed with a few male celebs and see myself wth guys.
DF-200-192403-625_1270.2
However occassionally I seem to have feelings for older females but I'm not sure if they are like sexual feelings and it's quite confusing.
DF-200-192403-625_1270.3
For the first time there is a female who I like whos quite a bit older and I definitely have feelings.
DF-200-192403-625_1270.4
I know that she isn't straight.
DF-200-192403-625_1270.5
I deliberately try to talk to her and spend time with her even though shes clearly quite a bit older.
DF-200-192403-625_1270.6
Perhaps they are more feelings because I look up to the person?
DF-200-192403-625_1270.7
I'm really not sure, does anyone have any ideas?
DF-200-192403-625_1270.8
What does this mean?
DF-200-192403-625_1270.9
it seems strange when I am physically attracted to men?
DF-200-192403-625_1270.10
If you're physically attracted to men and you're not sexually aroused by her, I'd say you have your answer there It might be that you get nervous and your heart beats faster because you are anxious to please her, or her opinion of you matters to you?
DF-200-192403-625_1270.11
If you scour the forums and do a search, you'll see that you're not the only one who has ever felt like this about a teacher of the same gender.
DF-200-192403-625_1270.12
I used to - in fact, still! - attach to female teachers and tutors a lot.
DF-200-192403-625_1270.13
My counsellor had great fun dissecting it and telling me how I'm sexually attracted to mother figures, but he was just an arse
DF-200-192403-625_1504.1
I wasn't in a relationship with this guy but we've been seeing each other.
DF-200-192403-625_1504.2
In first year we were always together in the same group of friends..
DF-200-192403-625_1504.3
it was fine.
DF-200-192403-625_1504.4
Now in second year, he's decided he doesn't want to see me anymore.
DF-200-192403-625_1504.5
He wants to be 'friends'.
DF-200-192403-625_1504.6
But I know he doesn't really want to be friends at all.
DF-200-192403-625_1504.7
I think he's got someone else.. and that's why he's finished it but I don't really care that he's finished it.
DF-200-192403-625_1504.8
What I do care about is that I've been completely cut out.
DF-200-192403-625_1504.9
He lives in the same place as me and hasn't spoken to me once since.
DF-200-192403-625_1504.10
I've been cut out of nights out, get togethers.. etc all because I'm not seeing him anymore.
DF-200-192403-625_1504.11
This really upsets me, I want to be friends with him and I'm willing to be but he seems to have cut me out so now I'm not seeing other people either
DF-200-192403-625_1504.12
Really hate it.
DF-200-192403-625_1504.13
What can I do/say?
DF-200-192403-625_1504.14
Other people have cut me out because I'm not with him anymore either!
DF-200-192403-625_1504.15
This is what you do :
DF-200-192403-625_1504.16
In future you make your own friends, not someone elses.
DF-200-192403-625_1504.17
This is what you say :
DF-200-192403-625_1504.18
Oh well, life's not over.
DF-200-192403-625_1504.19
My ex cut me out as soon as he got a new gf even though he promised to be friends, and that was 2 months ago
DF-200-192403-625_1504.20
so my best piece of advice is try to move on
DF-200-192403-625_1504.21
its bloody hurtful and hard
DF-200-192403-625_1504.22
at first i spent the first 5 weeks cryingmy eyes out not sleeping, then it ended up that i felt i had done something wrong and therefore he dumped me
DF-200-192403-625_1504.23
he let me blame myself and for weeks i kept thinking what if i had said this or done that, and then i found out him and his new gf were togther behind my back and i was nothing to do with it,.
DF-200-192403-625_1504.24
So i think if you have like one other friend go out with them, maybe get a job or hobby and meet new people show him you dont care these boys love to think we are sitting at home waiting for their text which we might be but they cant know that
DF-200-192403-625_1582.1
I have never done something like this before, but i have nobody to ask/ talk to for advice as i cant tell anybody i know
DF-200-192403-625_1582.2
my ex boyfriend had been with me for about 7 months when he went to uni he cheated on me and dumped me.
DF-200-192403-625_1582.3
He is now in a official relationship with the girl he cheated on me with, becuase of this we have no spoken since he dumped me 2 months ago
DF-200-192403-625_1582.4
it was a VERY VERY VERY bad break up
DF-200-192403-625_1582.5
However when we did break up i was a bit of a idiot and begged him not to leave me becuase i was in love with him,
DF-200-192403-625_1582.6
However ive been feeling ill for a few weeks and went i went to the doctor she said im potentially pregnant.
DF-200-192403-625_1582.7
Im freaking out
DF-200-192403-625_1582.8
yes i need to do a test but i dont know when as i cant let anybody find out,
DF-200-192403-625_1582.9
also i feel i cant tell nmy ex as he thinks everything i do is for his attention to gain him back,
DF-200-192403-625_1582.10
if i tell him i might be pregnant he willl assume im lying to break up him and his new gf which im not but i dont know what to do
DF-200-192403-625_1582.11
im scared and i dont know how i can tell hiim without him accusing me of being a liar.
DF-200-192403-625_1582.12
She said you're "potentially pregnant"?
DF-200-192403-625_1582.13
What kind of a doctor would say that without giving you a test?
DF-200-192403-625_1582.14
do a test and get it all over and done with
DF-200-192403-625_1582.15
How about you do a test first and then think of the how to approach it?
DF-200-192403-625_1582.16
...take it from one who knows, no Doctor is going to tell you that you might be pregnant, and then send you home to deal with it.
DF-200-192403-625_1582.17
I don't understand why you haven't done a pregnancy test.
DF-200-192403-625_1582.18
they only cost about £3 or so.
DF-200-192403-625_1582.19
Get on and do it and then sort yourself out.
DF-200-192403-625_1582.20
Go straight to the doctor.
DF-200-192403-625_1582.21
Like get up and go now.
DF-200-192403-625_1582.22
They'll give you another test just to make sure (however pregnancy tests are rarely wrong when they read positive).
DF-200-192403-625_1582.23
They will discuss your options with you and probably direct you towards some people who can give you counselling if you ask.
DF-200-192403-625_1582.24
Your options are obviously: termination, continue with pregnancy and have the child adopted, continue with pregnancy and keep the child.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.1
First off, it's best that I explain that I've barely any experience with girls.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.2
I'm in my second year of uni and I, um, 'opened my account' in the sexual world the other night with a girl at my student union.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.3
We've met a few times before and have quite a few mutual friends, so she wasn't a complete stranger.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.4
Went back to hers for the night (she chose that location because she had lectures the following morning) and thought I handled the actual sex relatively well...
DF-200-192403-625_1668.5
The problem I have lies in the aftermath.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.6
I can be pretty insecure at times (it's a wonder I actually made it back to hers, because I was worried I was imposing too much), and when I woke up I panicked and said I had to go and get some work done (which I genuinely did, although thinking back on it, it was a weak reason to leave).
DF-200-192403-625_1668.7
She decided not to go in for her lecture (which I eventually realised was probably a hint for me to stay for a bit) and we had a pretty friendly chat whilst I collected my phone, keys etc. together.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.8
She even asked if I wanted her to come back to mine, but I refused and said something stupid like 'nah it's okay, have a lie in', which I've been kicking myself for.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.9
I just got myself into a panic and had a mental block.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.10
So I left, and sent her a light-hearted text a couple of hours later apologising for leaving so hastily and hoping that she had a good night... and didn't get a response.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.11
From here, I don't know where to go.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.12
To her, I probably came off as someone who does this all the time, and she was just one girl on a list of dozens I've had one night stands with.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.13
I just felt like I was a bit clinical and almost rude, especially with her asking if I wanted her to come back with me.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.14
All I want to do now is somehow show her that I'm not an absolute prick, without seeming too desperate or clingy.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.15
I realise the error of my ways, and have beaten myself up over it massively ever since I left hers...
DF-200-192403-625_1668.16
I don't think it's a completely irretrievable situation, because she's genuinely a lovely girl, and I reckon I can convince her I'm not the womanising idiot she (probably) thinks I am... but my lack of experience with girls leaves me with no idea what to do.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.17
Help, please!?!?
DF-200-192403-625_1668.18
i see what you mean.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.19
i'd suggest giving her another text asking perhaps to meet up - cinema, dvd, or grab a coffee/lunch before lectures or something.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.20
if she ignores this too then just move on to the next
DF-200-192403-625_1668.21
then again, she mightn't want anything serious, so just go slow.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.22
Just text her and invite her to go out.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.23
To clarify are you just looking to 'have fun' with the girl, or are you cool with the idea of going a little serious?
DF-200-192403-625_1668.24
I get the impression she likes you and is maybe looking for something a little bit serious than occasional banging..
DF-200-192403-625_1668.25
I'm not really sure, to be honest.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.26
I kinda wanna take it one step at a time.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.27
Asking her out for a cuppa could be a good idea, although I don't want to do that just as a way of saying sorry.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.28
I'd rather clear the air first and show her that I know I made a mistake before getting into anything else with her.
DF-200-192403-625_1668.29
you complete bloody numpty
DF-200-192403-625_1668.30
you have learnt a valuable lesson
DF-200-192403-625_3769.1
I'm scared as to how he might react and it's been 4 weeks and I've still not found the perfect moment to tell him.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.2
Also I'm afraid what if he doesn't want to keep it when I really do.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.3
Although he's a couple of year older than me (19), he can act really immature, aggressive, and violent at time.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.4
My parents have come to terms with it now after having little mini heart attacks, it's just how can I break it to him?
DF-200-192403-625_3769.5
I think you should break it to him gentally.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.6
Make sure your having a proper convo like one on one and eye contact, then break it to him.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.7
Remember it will be a shock to him but hopefully in the end he will pull though and surport you.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.8
I don't think there is a way to tell him other than just being straight to the point.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.9
Regardless of his reaction or personal feelings about pregnancy or abortion, he has a right to know.

Talk to him about what you want to do and what he would like to happen.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.11
If you agree, great. If you can't then talking to your parents might be the next best thing.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.12
Well he asked you to get the morning after pill, did you say you would?
DF-200-192403-625_3769.13
If you agreed to take the morning after pill but didn't then that's quite unfair and he will be annoyed.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.14
It's obvious he didn't want a baby because he was using contraception and even though it failed he did say he wanted you to take the morning after pill, so don't be surprised if he does a runner.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.15
You just have to be honest with him and hopefully he will take care of his responsibilities.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.16
You said your Mum knows?
DF-200-192403-625_3769.17
Well break the news with her by your side then, hopefully your boyfriend won't get violent or anything.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.18
Give him time to digest the information.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.19
It will come as a shock, particularly if you thought you'd played it safe.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.20
I know you said you didn't think you could have an abortion, but it's important to talk things through with him and decide what's best to do for both of you and, most importantly, for the baby.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.21
Yeah I'll tell you guys tomorrow I'm just afraid as he's prone to act violent at times.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.22
+ He told me to take the pill and I didn't and he's gonna be like 'WTF There's no way I can support a child at 19 and that you shouldn't be having a kid as you're not even 18 yet blah blah blah'...
DF-200-192403-625_3769.23
So I'll just tell him he doesn't have to be involved with our child financially and I just want him to be there for it as a fatherly figure (which I doubt he can commit to) as my Parents can support us anyways.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.24
This is going to sound harsh and I understand it is your body, but I am going to be brutally honest.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.25
Get an abortion.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.26
Firstly, you may want to keep it, but think about it in the long run.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.27
What kind of life will the baby live?
DF-200-192403-625_3769.28
You are still a kid yourself, around 16/17 I would assume.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.29
I doubt you will be able to give it a good life.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.30
Also your boyfriend.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.31
I doubt he will be happy and most of the time, boys in this situation will bail.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.32
He is 19, I doubt he has any long term plans to stay with you.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.33
By keeping the baby you are pretty much being selfish.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.34
Yeah its your body, but there are 2 people you need to think about :
DF-200-192403-625_3769.35
1. The baby. I can almost guarantee you will not be able to give the baby a good life because of how young you are, and I doubt the father will stay.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.36
2. Your boyfreind. He is 19, you are dragging him down for life at such a young age by keeping it.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.37
Actually 3 people.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.38
Yourself. You may end up regretting it in the long run.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.39
Having a baby is a huge responsibility.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.40
This is children having children.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.41
Do everyone a favor and have an abortion.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.42
Harsh but true.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.43
You will just end up adding to the long and miserable statistic.
DF-200-192403-625_3769.44
EDIT: Cant believe I was actually negged for this. Truth ****ing hurts.
DF-200-192403-625_3972.1
I'm confused, i love him or i thought i did so why am i turned off him now?
DF-200-192403-625_3972.2
He admitted to me that he is bisexual we were talking about ex's and he told me about one ex who is another guy.
DF-200-192403-625_3972.3
I was shocked and asked him why he didn't tell me before, he said he didn't see a reason to tell me because he liked me a lot.
DF-200-192403-625_3972.4
He should have told me, i'm turned off at the thought of him with other guys and being sexually attracted to another guy.
DF-200-192403-625_3972.5
Will this feeling go away or shall i break up?
DF-200-192403-625_3972.6
Don't feel guilty for feeling like that.
DF-200-192403-625_3972.7
Nothing wrong with being bi, but just as bi's have a taste for guys and girls, some people don't have a taste for bi's, if you know what I mean?
DF-200-192403-625_3972.8
If you're really into him stick around, maybe it's just the shock that's making you feel this way.
DF-200-192403-625_3972.9
Maybe wait a few days and see how the news settles with you before making a decision?
DF-200-192403-625_3972.10
Everyone has a past, to judge him on his would be unfair if you love him.
DF-200-192403-625_3972.11
But if it turns you off or you can't come to terms with it then its probably best to break it off.
DF-200-192403-625_3972.12
Either way, give yourself a few days to think about it first if you're not sure.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.1
I've suffered with excess body hair since I was young, and I was bullied because of it through primary/secondary school and now am unable to wear tshirts etc in public because of how paranoid I am about it.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.2
I went to the doctors because of it when I was around 11, and they did a blood test but it came back normal so I assume I don't have PCOS.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.3
I have very hairy arms for a girl, not thick hairs like a males but lots of very noticable, dark and long (I bleach regularly but it only lasts a day or two before the roots are noticable).
DF-200-192410-470_2747.4
I have never shaved them because I shave my legs and get terrible ingrown hairs, even though I moisturise/exfoliate etc.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.5
I've tried waxing but it only lasted 2 days before the hairs began to grow back, so it's really not worth it.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.6
Anyway I checked out reviews and after shopping around I decided to get the £350 Boots Smooth Skin Plus Intense Pulsed Light permanent hair reduction machine.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.7
The reviews were on the whole very good, it comes with 20,000 flashes (it takes between 70-100 flashes to do my arms each time I think) and you need applicator gel which is £3.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.8
It appears to do exactly the same thing as you would get in a laser clinic, but cheaper and means I will be able to target any missed hairs you might get going to a clinic and it's obviously private/convenient.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.9
The sales assistant in Boots was very helpful, and assured me I could get a no-quibble refund if I find it doesn't work but she assured me it will.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.10
I'm going to use it on my arms first of all, because this is the area that affects me the most confidence wise, but will gradually move on to other areas.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.11
For permanent hair reduction I will need to use the machine once a week for between 6-12 weeks (although I will probably need 12 weeks!) and will start using it tonight.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.12
I'm quite sceptical over whether it will work but because I'm confident I can return it, I think it was worth the risk.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.13
I know other girls on here have the same issue with excess body hair, so will monitor the hair reduction over the 12 weeks course to let you know how it goes incase anyone else is thinking of buying one
DF-200-192410-470_2747.14
Week 1: Shaved my arms and zapped them today, did it in two separate goes (took around 30 mins to do each arm) and my sister did them for me just because certain angles are tricky to get to.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.15
On a pain scale I'd give it 2/10 (just feels like a hot, tingling sensation for about 1 second then fades).
DF-200-192410-470_2747.16
Will update what the regrowth is like next Saturday.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.17
Week 2: Had to shave my arms again last night all over, hair regrowth not as course or fast as expected but still widespread.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.18
Just finished zapping them again but this time did it myself, found it to be much quicker.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.19
I was thinking of buying one of these because I just think it would be the best thing ever to never have to shave my bikini area again!
DF-200-192410-470_2747.20
Let us know how you get on!
DF-200-192410-470_2747.21
If this works well I would definitely buy one, I hate shaving and my arms are quite hairy as well (I don't shave or bleach them but I am self conscious), so I'd love to be hair free forever.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.22
Please let us know how you get on
DF-200-192410-470_2747.23
Thanks for doing this, OP.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.24
I've been debating whether to get one of these machines too.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.25
I really hope it works for you.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.26
I hope it works too!
DF-200-192410-470_2747.27
I suffer from excess body hair and would love for a machine that could get rid of it!
DF-200-192410-470_2747.28
Is there any way you can use this kind of thing on your face?
DF-200-192410-470_2747.29
I assume goggles would be necessary but it would be really nice if it were possible.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.30
I have been looking both at this and the Phillips Lumea, which is a little more expensive, but I keep thinking it's too much of an expense for something that I'm not 100% sure will work.
DF-200-192410-470_2747.31
Looking forward to hearing what your results are like for this, as I'd love to be able to buy something that would mean I wouldn't have to shave every two days in the summer!
DF-200-192410-470_2993.1
Without any cosmetic enhancements.
DF-200-192410-470_2993.2
Tips? hints?
DF-200-192410-470_2993.3
In an ideal world I'd like to hit a 8/10.
DF-200-192410-470_2993.4
I ask this because I want to start 'mingling'.
DF-200-192410-470_2993.5
I'd like to look like 'something special' for once.
DF-200-192410-470_2993.6
Styling your hair and cloth helps a lot.
DF-200-192410-470_2993.7
A bit of make-up, almost every girl wears make-up.
DF-200-192410-470_2993.8
Some nice accessories would help too.
DF-200-192410-470_2993.9
Dye your hair a ridic colour.
DF-200-192410-470_2993.10
Wear really weird earrings.
DF-200-192410-470_2993.11
Wear clashing colours!
DF-200-192410-470_2993.12
Bright red (or orange, or any colour, if you're confident enough) lippy.
DF-200-192410-470_3338.1
Im really pale and sick of using fake tan...coming out patchy and smelling like curry is awful!
DF-200-192410-470_3338.2
I have loads of freckles over my body so it doesnt even look nice natural!
DF-200-192410-470_3338.3
I wanted to start using sunbeds...not to often but just to build a nice natural tan!
DF-200-192410-470_3338.4
But when i go on holiday i burn really easily so i was wondering whether i would burn if i went on the sunbeds or if i built it up it would be gradually get my skin to go tanned?
DF-200-192410-470_3338.5
Don't use sunbeds.
DF-200-192410-470_3338.6
Pale freckly skin is lovely, and sunbeds are really dangerous and just not good for you.
DF-200-192410-470_3338.7
Sunbeds are very dangerous, especially with regular use and for people with naturally pale complexions, and you say you have 'freckles' all over your body.
DF-200-192410-470_3338.8
Some of these may be moles and so it's just not safe.
DF-200-192410-470_3338.9
Invest in a proffessional fake spray tan - there are more and more salons.
DF-200-192410-470_3338.10
Or just be pale and beautiful as I am
DF-200-192410-470_3459.1
I am so confused and annoyed!
DF-200-192410-470_3459.2
My mac nc55 studio fix fluid was perfect for my face a couple of months ago but now my face looks dull and...muddy/ashy?
DF-200-192410-470_3459.3
Also my face and chest had a ridiculous colour difference.
DF-200-192410-470_3459.4
I googled nc45 just now and the girls actually look around my skin tone :/
DF-200-192410-470_3459.5
Is it possible to go from nc55 to nc45?
DF-200-192410-470_3459.6
My problem is where I should match my foundation to.
DF-200-192410-470_3459.7
My face is medium, my neck slightly darker and my chest so pale (compare to face and arms) it's unbelieveable.
DF-200-192410-470_3459.8
I would actually call my chest an nc 44.
DF-200-192410-470_3459.9
So what do I do?
DF-200-192410-470_3459.10
I feel I would look ghostly if I used nc45 but then my chest and face would be the same, help!
DF-200-192410-470_3459.11
Yes I have to different MAC foundations because my skin changes all the time.
DF-200-192410-470_3459.12
I would suggest going to the counter and asking them to match you again.
DF-200-192410-470_3459.13
Someone said that NW30/35 is meant to be a good shade for (brown/black) people who find themselves changing shades
DF-200-192410-470_3459.14
If you matched it to your chest wouldn't your neck look weird though?
DF-200-192410-470_3459.15
I would always say to match to your face as your natural colouring will always suit you best.
DF-200-192410-470_3459.16
I'm very pale caucasian and my chest is darker than my face, if I were to match to my chest I'd just look a bit mucky, like I hadn't washed in weeks, and I think that if your foundation doesn't completely blend into your natural skintone along your jawline you can look like you're wearing a mask.
DF-200-192410-470_3459.17
I recommend getting colour matched to your jawline and then adjust with bronzers/highlighters.
DF-200-192410-470_4006.1
I got my nose pierced a couple of weeks ago with a stud.
DF-200-192410-470_4006.2
It's not a bone so it is literally just a stud, similar to earrings.
DF-200-192410-470_4006.3
Because of this is falls out all the time as theres nothing inside to keep it in place.
DF-200-192410-470_4006.4
I want to change to an L-shaped stud, but i'm worried it won't go in easily because i've had it pierced with a straight stud.
DF-200-192410-470_4006.5
Any advice?
DF-200-192410-470_4006.6
Why the hell did they pierce you with a straight stud?
DF-200-192410-470_4006.7
Go back to the piercer and ask for it to be changed or find a piercer who will, they should be able to swap it without any fuss.
DF-200-192410-470_4006.8
I had mine pierced with a straight stud, it was flipping awkward.
DF-200-192410-470_4006.9
Don't do what I did though, and change it before the 6 weeks or whatever, as you will probably get an infection which comes up as a nasty wart thing on your nose. D:
DF-200-192410-470_4006.10
The L-shaped studs are different to put in to the straight ones, but if you get the technique right, once you do it correctly, you can do it again.
DF-200-192410-470_4006.11
You put the first bit of the L shape in the hole, making sure you can feel the tip of the end on the inside of your nose.
DF-200-192410-470_4006.12
Then press firmly, twisting slightly upwards and it should slide in.
DF-200-192410-470_4006.13
If you still have troubles, just go see the piercer and they'll put it in for you
DF-200-192410-470_5205.1
I noticed i was getting these permanent forehead lines and that my face was a bit dry.
DF-200-192410-470_5205.2
I decided to use some moisturizer and its helped.
DF-200-192410-470_5205.3
Do many other guys choose to moisturize?
DF-200-192410-470_5205.4
I use clarins for men :-)
DF-200-192410-470_5205.5
The daily wash on my face, the exfoliating scrub twice a week, and the anti-shine moisturiser on a daily basis (at least).
DF-200-192410-470_5205.6
I have tried the cheaper brands, loreal and nivea, and I think they make my skin feel worse.
DF-200-192410-470_5205.7
I use cheap generic moisturiser after shaving because my skin gets dry and sometimes tender after shaving.
DF-200-192410-470_5205.8
I only do it after a shave because otherwise the facial hair stops it from melting into the skin properly.
DF-200-192410-470_5205.9
Any moisturiser labelled as 'aftershave balm' or 'aftershave lotion' or 'for men' etc. is just a big rip off.
DF-200-192410-470_5205.10
It is exactly the same stuff as cheap moisturiser but it is marketed towards meathead guys who think that moisturiser is 'liek so gay'.
DF-200-192410-470_5205.11
Nivea aftershave lotion is around £3-5 for a tiny 100ml bottle wheras you can get a big 500ml bottle of generic stuff for about a pound that has exactly the same effect.
DF-200-192410-470_5205.12
This is just the modern day version of the old 'mansize tissues' marketing one-two.
DF-200-192410-470_5205.13
"Oh, it has the word 'man' in it so it isn't gay anymore"
DF-200-192410-470_5205.14
I had grade 2 acne and it was particularly bad when I 'overwashed' so I was compelled to wash less and to start moisturising (Nivea: Dry Skin, after washing or shaving) in my late teens.
DF-200-192410-470_5205.15
I also use moisturising shower gel or I get BACNE, nice
DF-200-192410-470_5205.16
Result is my skin is smoother than it is on some teenage girls!-
DF-200-192410-470_5205.17
goes down well with the ladies and I look a LOT younger than my years, though that's probably more to do with genetics eh
DF-200-192410-470_6635.1
Anyone else get one?
DF-200-192410-470_6635.2
I was very impressed after last months Batiste fiasco...
DF-200-192410-470_6635.3
I got the Ciate Nail polish in Kitten Heels Ilamasqua Sheer lipgloss in Explode Nouveau strip lashes Weleda Pomegranate Regenerating Body Oil and Xen-Tan Deep bronze luxe.
DF-200-192410-470_6635.4
What did you all think!
DF-200-192410-470_6635.5
I think that is well worth £10.
DF-200-192410-470_6635.6
Sounds good.
DF-200-192410-470_6635.7
I like the idea of the glossy box and was going to sign up a couple of months ago. But I am worried incase I end up with a load of stuff I just wont use.
DF-200-192410-470_6635.8
The Xen Tan sounds good!

I tried to order a maxi dress online last night from Jane Norman, but when I entered my details, I was told the order hadn't gone through.

DF-200-192410-470_8156.7
I read here somewhere that Jane Norman had gone bust?
DF-200-192410-470_8156.8
I don't know if they are just closing the stores or both but I think you should see if they have a number you can call.

I would also call your bank.

I've always wanted to do this but never had the courage.
DF-200-192410-470_8334.5
Congratulations!
DF-200-192410-470_8334.6
I too would buy a lace front wig if I did it but they're so damn expensive and time consuming to put on.
DF-200-192410-470_8576.1
I do not know whether to buy a foundation primer - they are very expensive, being almost the same price as the foundation (for example laura mercier foundation primer).
DF-200-192410-470_8576.2
Are they actually worth it?
DF-200-192410-470_8576.3
Do they make a real difference to your skin, or is it just a marketing ploy?
DF-200-192410-470_8576.4
Does anyone have any they would recommend?
DF-200-192410-470_8576.5
Thank you in advance!
DF-200-192410-470_8576.6
They're definitely worth it, but I don't wear a primer every day so I suppose I'm willing to pay a bit more for them.
DF-200-192410-470_8576.7
I only really wear a primer if I'm going out.
DF-200-192410-470_8576.8
Depends what your skin is like, really.
DF-200-192410-470_8576.9
As a general rule, if your skin isn't totally perfect, or if it's a bit oily, then a primer is going to make your foundation last a lot longer and look a lot better.
DF-200-192410-470_8576.10
I never used to use it, but in the last few weeks I've really seen a difference.
DF-200-192410-470_9050.1
Would you get, or do you know anybody who has gotten a Harry Potter tattoo anywhere on their body?
DF-200-192410-470_9050.2
If you're confused (though I can't see why you would be) this is what I am talking about
DF-200-192410-470_9050.3
and there are many, many more...
DF-200-192410-470_9050.4
Now, I am as much of a HP fan-geek as the next person, but I would never dream of getting a huge HP montage on my body.
DF-200-192410-470_9050.5
Imo, while I do love HP and have grown up with it etc. etc., I know when I am 40+ years old I will look back upon the tattoo and wonder what made me decide to get it.
DF-200-192410-470_9050.6
I can understand why people would want to get it done - it's declaration of their love for HP and stuff, but I personally wouldn't ever get a Harry Potter tattoo.
DF-200-192410-470_9050.7
Some small quotes/symbols don't look too bad, but that's just because I can appreciate the sentiments behind it.
DF-200-192410-470_9050.8
But, while I think they do look pretty cool on other people, I know it is just a phase for me and that's why I would never have it done.
DF-200-192410-470_9050.9
Any thought or opinions?
DF-200-192410-470_9050.10
Has anyone actually had one done or is thinking about getting one done?
DF-200-192410-470_9050.11
It's your body, up to you what you put on it.
DF-200-192410-470_9050.12
Sure you will get some funny looks and people will judge you.
DF-200-192410-470_9050.13
Kind of like those Twighlight tattoo's middle aged women get, I find that more disturbing than young people getting HP tattoo's - they will probably look back when they are 30/40/50 and remember their childhood.
DF-200-192410-470_9050.14
Yet these people who get the tattoo's aged 30+ already.... that's another story.
DF-200-192410-470_9050.15
Yeah, I mean, it's one thing to proclaim yourself as a fan of Harry Potter, and another thing entirely to parade around as poster for it
DF-200-192410-470_9050.16
Tbh, most of what people get is just for the sake of getting a HP tattoo, not necessarily because of the meaning or symbolism behind it...
DF-200-192410-470_9050.17
Never.. They do realise that in 50+ years time, they're still going to have "Expecto Patronum" tattooed on them..?
DF-200-192410-470_9050.18
Imagine trying to explain that to your children/grandchildren "Yes, I did get a tattoo of something from a fiction book..."
DF-200-192410-470_9050.19
I would never get it myself, but I would definitely love to meet a person who would and be their friend lol....devotion to the next level
DF-200-192410-470_9050.20
I wonder how outdated we will think Harry Potter is 50 years time
DF-200-192410-471_1085.1
So after wearing glasses for about 10 years now, I think its finally time to get contacts.
DF-200-192410-471_1085.2
I would seriously appreciate some advise from people who use contacts already plz!!
DF-200-192410-471_1085.3
So there are these asda ones which seem to be quite cheap :
DF-200-192410-471_1085.4
and in contrast there are these ones that they sell @ vision express :
DF-200-192410-471_1085.5
^^^ are almost double the price.
DF-200-192410-471_1085.6
So my questions are :
DF-200-192410-471_1085.7
a) Mite sound a bit stupid but would my vision be better with the more expensive ones?
DF-200-192410-471_1085.8
b) Are the daily ones better than the weeklies (as they are cheaper)
DF-200-192410-471_1085.9
c) Say if i do get weeklies/monthlies, can i sleep/go to the shower with them?
DF-200-192410-471_1085.10
d)Finaly, which shop/website do you recommend and some buying advise would be realy good plz!!
DF-200-192410-471_1085.11
I'd recommend going to your optician first, you need to know your exact prescription, and whether anything else needs to be looked at, e.g. astigmatism, whether you'd suit wet ones or drier lenses.
DF-200-192410-471_1085.12
I prefer the daily ones, as there's no hassle of cleaning and storing them.
DF-200-192410-471_1085.13
You can shower in lenses, but I wouldn't recommend sleeping in them.
DF-200-192410-471_1085.14
I've done it a couple of times by accident, and I woke up in pain because they'd moved around back and sort of folded over under my eyelid.
DF-200-192410-471_1085.15
I personally wouldn't go for the cheapest ones.
DF-200-192410-471_1085.16
My eyes and my teeth are the only thing I don't skimp on, because it's so ridiculously expensive when things go wrong with them that it's just better to take very good care of them from the start.
DF-200-192410-471_4165.1
Hi all, Essentially, I'm looking for a "cover-up" (for lack of a better word) I can wear daily.
DF-200-192410-471_4165.2
I was wondering is primer alone suitable for this?
DF-200-192410-471_4165.3
The thing is I don't like to wear foundation AT ALL (my face feels weird).
DF-200-192410-471_4165.4
With regards to tinted moisturiser, I have Benefit's tinted moisturiser - it's okay but I prefer to use it for night's out or special events.
DF-200-192410-471_4165.5
Somehow it still feels heavy on my face.
DF-200-192410-471_4165.6
Is there a much lighter tined moisturiser out there?
DF-200-192410-471_4165.7
Any advice or tips for what would be suitable for me to wear and brands?
DF-200-192410-471_4165.8
I'd prefer to keep away from foundation if possible.
DF-200-192410-471_4165.9
Thank you!
DF-200-192410-471_4165.10
I know what you said about foundation, but try Body Shop.
DF-200-192410-471_4165.11
it's really light, then use a powder brush to put a LIGHT dusting of a pressed powder.
DF-200-192410-471_4165.12
if you're just looking for a blemish cover, rimmel do a blemish stick which covers a multitude of sins.
DF-200-192410-471_4165.13
Make sure you remove any make up with a good non greasy cleanser if you don't want pizza face
DF-200-192410-471_4165.14
Primer doesn't usually give any coverage.
DF-200-192410-471_4165.15
Tinted moisturiser gives a little, but imo doesn't do much at all and I don't like the feel and texture on my skin.
DF-200-192410-471_4165.16
I used a Stila one as it was ok, but slightly greasy
DF-200-192410-471_4165.17
I'd just get a really light foundation e.g. Givenchy
DF-200-192434-451_6456.1
Do you remember that movie that was based on Nothern Lights by Philip Pullman?
DF-200-192434-451_6456.2
How come they never made a sequal?
DF-200-192434-451_6456.3
I was shocked..there was so much hype when it came out...it was so anticipated...x
DF-200-192434-451_6456.4
Well in the series of Philip Pullman books, the next one in the sequence is called The Subtle Knife, I guess they would make a film of that rather than calling it The Golden Compass 2.
DF-200-192434-451_6456.5
I imagine they wouldn't make a sequel because the first film wasn't very good.
DF-200-192434-451_6456.6
If they even think of calling it "The Golden Compass 2", I will go into Genocide Mode.
DF-200-192434-451_6456.7
It pissed me off enough that they change Northern Lights to The Golden Compass for no apparent reason as it is, let alone ****ing up the rest of the trilogy.
DF-200-192434-451_6456.8
The film sold well in Europe but poorly in America, as a lot of religious groups saw the film as anti-christian/religion and so it got a lot of bad press.
DF-200-192434-451_6456.9
The American market is what matters (afterall, they took the american title of the book, not the original title), so all plans for a sequel were canned.
DF-200-192434-451_6456.10
Not to mention that The Golden Compass stripped off all the references to religion it possibly could, but that's pretty much impossible in the sequels.
DF-200-192434-451_6456.11
How can you kill God without any religious context?
DF-200-192434-451_6456.12
So if there was bad press for the first film it'd only get a million times worse by the time the last film came out.
DF-200-192434-451_6456.13
To many fans it's difficult to see how The Golden Compass could've even carried the series forward since it left out a lot of the important parts of the Magesterium that is developed in the sequels.
DF-200-192434-451_6456.14
In short, if there is ever to be a Dark Materials Trilogy, it'll have to be from a British film production company who don't care what the Bible Belt thinks.
DF-200-192434-451_6456.15
It would've been nice if someone decided to take it on after the Harry Potter film craze dies down, but since it's been tried once and failed I think it's going to be a good few years (10 or so?) before anyone thinks of touching it again.
DF-200-192434-451_6456.16
Hopefully if it happens they'll do a Lord of the Rings and film it in one big go rather than wait to see if the box office figures validate a sequel. :/
DF-200-192434-451_7273.1
I don't either but I can see why he's doing it.
DF-200-192434-451_7273.2
Cameron is re-releasing Avatar with 6 additional minutes of footage.
DF-200-192434-451_7273.3
People might think it's a waste of effort, but those 6 minutes will no doubt bring him at least, a few more million $$$ in the bank, just like this 3D crap will for Lucas.
DF-200-192434-451_7273.4
Depends on the film, I thought it was interesting to see Avatar in 3D, but no other movie since has interested me in 3D (Harry Potter in 3D is a joke)
DF-200-192434-451_7273.5
On the subject of Star Wars, as a massive fan since I was a child this saddens me as I would like the films to be left as they are. (Saying that I do agreed with the remastering they did for the 20th anniversary...)
DF-200-192434-451_7273.6
Though being the whore that I am... I will probably splash the cash to watch Star Wars on the big screen again...
DF-200-192434-451_7273.7
Hollywood money-grabber cashes in while contributing to destroying new technology - shocker.
DF-200-192434-451_7273.8
I also disagree with people who would say "why not?".
DF-200-192434-451_7273.9
Artistic integrity, for instance.
DF-200-192434-451_7273.10
It would be far more appealing to see those films fully remastered in IMAX, rather than a tacky bandwagon jump, and it would still rake in money.
DF-200-192434-451_7273.11
The problem is "good" is still a long way off the kind of images audiences expect.
DF-200-192434-451_7273.12
Without the Force, an after-conversion will never even begin to look good.
DF-200-192434-451_7273.13
If you had six films, which weren't released in their in-universe chronological order originally, wouldn't you want to change it for any subsequent release?
DF-200-192434-451_7273.14
The prequels would definitely be improved with 3D, because like Avatar they're all about spectacle and explosions and the "plot" is really just there to string the spectacle and explosions along for 2 hours.
DF-200-192434-451_7273.15
You can't tell me you wouldn't want to see, say, the opening battle in ROTS in 3D?
DF-200-192434-451_7273.16
That was awesome enough in the cinema anyway, but it could really be enhanced by ILM doing their thang.
DF-200-192434-451_7273.17
I am less optimistic about the core films being convincing in 3D, because as much as I love their visual effects, they were designed 20 years before people even began talking about the possibility of 3D as it has been realised today.
DF-200-192434-451_7273.18
They have held up very well because the story and characters are strong, not because the visual effects are up to much, revolutionary though they were at the time.
DF-200-192434-451_7273.19
Still, this is ILM we're talking about here, hopefully all six films will come out looking pretty good.
DF-200-192434-451_7273.20
However what I really want is a Blu-ray collection of all six.
DF-200-192434-451_7273.21
Hurry the **** up, George.
DF-200-192434-451_7335.1
Has anyone heard of this film?
DF-200-192434-451_7335.2
It stars, among others, Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, Winona Ryder and Mila Kunis.
DF-200-192434-451_7335.3
It has received some amazing reviews.
DF-200-192434-451_7335.4
It is going to be officially released here in the UK next year in February, but it is going to be shown at the London Film Festival next month.
DF-200-192434-451_7335.5
I read the screenplay a while ago.
DF-200-192434-451_7335.6
A lot of visual potential but a little weak in the storytelling department.
DF-200-192434-451_7335.7
Hopefully Aronofsky has been able to turn it around, though I'm not really digging the trailer - Mulholland Drive anyone?
DF-200-192434-451_7335.8
It has Mila Kunis kissing Natalie Portman in one scene.
DF-200-192434-451_7335.9
It's safe to say the film will attract viewers.
DF-200-192434-451_7650.1
id played a video game called the prince of persia but there is already a film coming out.
DF-200-192434-451_7650.2

DF-200-192434-451_7650.3
Planning to see the movie alone
DF-200-192434-451_7650.4
I think it looks AWFUL, personally.
DF-200-192434-451_7650.5
I really can't stand that actress because she plays the most annoying characters ever, and her character in Prince of Persia really grates in just the trailers.
DF-200-192434-451_7650.6
Not to mention that the script sounds horrendous.
DF-200-192434-451_7650.7
I haven't seen it though...
DF-200-192434-451_7719.1
I was gonna ask if I was the only one who thought this, but a quick Google search of 'Sex and the City 2 racist' answers that question.
DF-200-192434-451_7719.2
Was the film racist?
DF-200-192434-451_7719.3
Was it intentional, to add to the vapid ignorance of the characters?
DF-200-192434-451_7719.4
Was it intentional pro-American propaganda?
DF-200-192434-451_7719.5
Or am I, and many critics, making something out of nothing?
DF-200-192434-451_7719.6
Thoughts TSR?
DF-200-192434-451_7719.7
It was kinda insulting to their culture.
DF-200-192434-451_7719.8
But the whole thing was exaggerated for the purpose of enhancing the storyline, e.g the clash between samantha's rampant sexuality and the "cover up" stereotype of eastern countries.
DF-200-192434-451_7719.9
I don't think anybody should get on their high horse about it, people only insult it because it's sex and the city, nobody gives a **** about stuff like that in other films.
DF-200-192434-451_7881.1
I was watching good will hunting and I realised how some of the things in the film apply to me eg pushing yourself away from people because you're scared that they'll find you imperfections etc.
DF-200-192434-451_7881.2
That really got me thinking about my life and what i need to change so if you have any films that have changed you personally or have made you change your outlook on life then plz share.
DF-200-192434-451_7881.3
If you're thinking, think about something useful and interesting which will get you somewhere: maths.
DF-200-192434-451_7881.4
I agree there's more than education.

If you don't want to think, you could get wasted or do something else etc.

DF-200-192434-451_7881.7
The Doom Generation. Saw 1, i know a lot of people got hooked up on the gore and 'sickness' of it, but the whole point of that film was philosophy about life and it did get me thinking for a while.
DF-200-192434-451_7881.8
Actually it led to a lengthy, involved discussion at uni in which someone ended up crying. So definitely good for thinking about life.
DF-200-192434-451_7881.9
And if you're willing to watch something that isn't a film but still goes in the DVD player, then any of the Bill Hicks stuff
DF-200-192434-451_7881.10
If anyone hasn't said The Blind Side yet, then that gets my vote!
DF-200-192434-451_7881.11
I saw the trailer for it and have yet to see the whole thing, but it looks amazing.
DF-200-192434-451_7881.12
And I don't necessarily think this film is going to make you think hard about life, but.. I also recommend watching Brick.
DF-200-192434-451_7881.13

The film is classed comedy-drama and is supposedly about the creators and the founding of Facebook.
DF-200-192434-451_8407.4
Facebook has been around for five years now and the question is, does it warrant a film?
DF-200-192434-451_8407.5
Are the makers hoping every Facebook user. around 200million globally will watch the film?
DF-200-192434-451_8407.6
Bit of a stupid idea how film production companies will make a movie about this when there a far better movie scripts out there.
DF-200-192434-451_8407.7
Why not make a film about Digg?
DF-200-192434-451_8407.8
That's got a better founding story than Facebook.

I personally use Facebook and think it's a useful thing to have, but to be honest why would I want to see a film about it?

DF-200-192434-451_8407.13
Yeah I heard about that about a year ago when it first went into production.

The Academy has announced that they will permit ten nominees for the Best Film category instead of the usual five.
DF-200-192434-451_8442.2
The reason behind the change is that the Academy, in the face of falling ratings, wants to attract more popularity to the Oscars.
DF-200-192434-451_8442.3
What do you think of this change?
DF-200-192434-451_8442.4
What would you do to make the Oscars more popular?
DF-200-192434-451_8442.5

It is a travesty!
DF-200-192434-451_8442.9
It was good no doubt, but the best?
DF-200-192434-451_8442.10
The judging panel just jumped on the bangwagon surrounding the media hype.
DF-200-192434-451_8442.11
I think The Dark Knight should have won the Best Film award, but they didn't even nominate that film.
DF-200-192434-451_8442.12
Out of the nominated ones, I think Milk was much better than Slumdog Millionaire.
DF-200-192434-451_8442.13
Though Frost/Nixon was pretty good as well.

DF-200-192446-380_7675.1
So in the last week, the new head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, has said: “All teachers should be qualified”.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.2
What an absolutely preposterous suggestion!
DF-200-192446-380_7675.3
You mean to say that, as citizens of this great nation, our children should be taught by professional people who have gone through the necessary rigmarole to be let loose in our schools?
DF-200-192446-380_7675.4
How dare we expect that from our education system. And while we're at it - why stop there?
DF-200-192446-380_7675.5
Let's round up our homeless and get them working in our hospitals.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.6
It'll get them off the streets and straight into promising careers.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.7
Youth unemployment is rife at the moment so let's get them piloting our aeroplanes.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.8
Heathrow might even get its third runway so we could do with a few more pilots.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.9
I heard overcrowding in jails is a problem too - especially since the rioting last summer.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.10
Why don't we just convert the miscreants to our side by giving them a uniform and a gun?
DF-200-192446-380_7675.11
They're bound to see sense and start making our streets safer instead of causing the trouble.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.12
And lastly, with the Easter holidays coming up, young children will need something to keep them occupied.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.13
Maybe they can try writing for a Sunday tabloid - I hear there are vacancies at The Sun.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.14
You may have sensed my slight sarcastic undertones - although that last suggestion might not be such a bad idea.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.15
Call me naive, but I always assumed that teachers were either qualified or training alongside someone qualified?
DF-200-192446-380_7675.16
It seems though that any old sod can do it.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.17
Is it any wonder then that the UK's position in the international league tables has slipped?
DF-200-192446-380_7675.18
So despite sounding incredibly obvious, Mr Wilshaw seems to have hit the nail on the head.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.19
Problem solved.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.20
I'm sure it comes as a welcome suggestion to all the fully trained, out-of-work teachers who struggle to get a job.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.21
Not to mention the ones who have jobs and have worked extremely hard to get there.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.22
So until then - if you're passing by your child's school, you might want to pop your head around the classroom door.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.23
Just to make sure one of the dinner ladies isn't also teaching maths.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.24
All teachers should be able to teach.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.25
Some piece of paper from a teaching academy does not equate to, by definition, being capable of teaching.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.26
I think all we need to do is think of some teachers we have had to know this.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.27
And at the same time I think we can all think of great teachers who have not had a piece of paper from a teacher training college.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.28
With this notion of qualifications there is an unholy alliance of two groups of people.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.29
The first is the well intended sponsors who think enforcing such rules will improve education by keeping so called unqualified teachers out.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.30
The second is the special interest group, the teachers unions, who want to keep competition out so they want a piece of paper that teachers need to have.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.31
This piece of paper is just another barrier to entry for outsiders and keeps the incumbent teachers safer from competition.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.32
The teachers unions hate competition and they have done a very good job of fending off competition under the guise of the public interest
DF-200-192446-380_7675.33
Fortunately we have things like the Khan Academy now that are going to seriously screw those monopolistic selfish bastards over.
DF-200-192446-380_7675.34
Suck on that educational establishment.

This is a story about BNP on DM
DF-200-192446-380_7702.2
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti....html#comments
DF-200-192446-380_7702.3
Unsurprisingly the most liked comments defend the BNP, the rest all praise the BNP, whether it be in a stealthy way or openly (most of the "best rated" comments openly support the BNP).
DF-200-192446-380_7702.4
Majority of the "worst rated" comments on that site criticise the BNP.
DF-200-192446-380_7702.5
I conclude that most of the readers of that paper are BNP sympathisers or supporters.
DF-200-192446-380_7702.6
p.s i would have been for the BNP if they just weren't racist or presented themselves as a "Christian party which support Christian values", some of their policies e.g "get out of Afghanistan", "stop being USA's poodle", "kick out muslims who dont integrate", "eradicate Islamic fundamentalism from britian" e.t.c really interest me.
DF-200-192446-380_7702.7
I wish liberals supported the policies i mentioned
DF-200-192446-380_7702.8
While I too think most of their readers are racist, I think for the majority they are more "friendly" racists than "BNP" racists.
DF-200-192446-380_7702.9
By friendly I mean that while they harbour racist views, they are perfectly polite to anyone of any race and don't go around being openly racist or discriminate against individuals.
DF-200-192446-380_7702.10
Still not a great quality to have, but nowhere near the level of vitriole as the BNP.
DF-200-192446-380_7702.11
I wouldn't compare them directly to the BNP - most of the readers are white middle class people who find many of the changes in society scary and the Daily Mail gives them stereotypes to blame without using too complicated language.
DF-200-192446-380_7702.12
Whilst it's an awful paper, comparing its entire readership to some of the monsters in the BNP party is wrong.
DF-200-192446-380_7752.1
Please post in this thread all discussion relating to the recent rise in tension between the UK and Argentina over the issue of the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands.
DF-200-192446-380_7752.2
Argentina is growing quite rapidly compared to the UK, but that is beside the point.
DF-200-192446-380_7752.3
If Argentina were to launch a surprise attack and take the island's airfields, then Britain would be effectively unable to retaliate due to lack of an aircraft carrier.
DF-200-192446-380_7752.4
Keep pretending everything is fine, though.
DF-200-192446-380_7752.5
Argentina - yes.
DF-200-192446-380_7752.6
Argentina's armed forces - no.
DF-200-192446-380_7752.7
Argentina launch a surprise attack?
DF-200-192446-380_7752.8
Well, it would certainly be surprising, not least to the members of their armed forces using the same kit they did in '82.
DF-200-192446-380_7752.9
They'd be astonished to learn that they had suddenly discovered the requisite experience, training and equipment to make such a landing possible.
DF-200-192446-380_7752.10
Not to mention we have the southern hemisphere's most capable attack aircraft stationed on the FIs.
DF-200-192446-380_7752.11
Yes, we're without an aircraft carrier, meaning we cannot retaliate in the same way we did in '82.
DF-200-192446-380_7752.12
However, this does not mean we cannot retaliate.
DF-200-192446-380_7752.13
We've proven that the Typhoon can fly from Ascension Island to the Falklands.
DF-200-192446-380_7752.14
The RN can still launch a task force that would, if allowed to fight openly, utterly decimate the Argentinian Navy and we retain the ability to launch Tomahawks directly through Ms. Kirchner's window should we wish.

As a matter of interest to the vegetarians and vegans out there, if it wasn't mixed with blood, and was simply stem-cell grown, would you eat it
DF-200-192446-380_7767.5
(I can see why vegans might be opposed, but I'm unsure about vegetarians)
DF-200-192446-380_7767.6
If it benefited my health then I would probably eat it.

Sounds interesting. Though I doubt they'll be able to replicate the taste of a good bit of beef any time soon.

I happened to watch a news review on Sky News this morning in which a bunch of journo's were bleating on that we shouldn't condemn all the "innocent" and hard working journalists at News International just because a whole bunch of hacks at the Sun were arrested...

because that would cause untold damage to the whole media industry.

Oh poor them.

This is precsisely, is it not?, what the whole media has been doing to the banking industry for the last two years or so?

Total hypocrisy.
DF-200-192446-380_7834.6
It is important to seperate the innocent from the guilty in both industries but it's ironic that the papers have been selling copy by basically tarring all bankers with the same brush and slagging them off mercilessly for years.

Isnt Sky News owned by BSkyB which is owned by News international or something?

The media condemning bankers is akin to a witch hunt, Stephen Hester was given just a £6.5M bonus in 2010 yet JPMorgan's top executive was paid $21M that year.

The media seem to have mixed up the man responsible for the merge with ABN Amro with the man responsible for fixing the failure of RBS.
DF-200-192446-380_7834.12
Moral of the story: the media will always present news in a way which forwards their views, it's that simple.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.1
I recently came across two stories, one about a PCSO in the UK who was arrested and sentenced to up to 10 years for having an "affair" with a 12 year old girl, and another where a woman in Utah was given up to 15 years for having sex with a 14 year old boy.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.2
For the sake of argument, lets say a 35 year old woman was having sex with a 14 year old boy and similarly a 35 year old man was having sex with a 14 year old girl.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.3
I can't think of a good reason why either of these scenarios should be worse than the other, but deep down i seem to feel that the first scenario isn't that serious at all.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.4
In order to give a reason as to why they are different i'd have to admit a difference in free will between young guys and girls, which is hard to do.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.5
But for some reason it almost seems like the 35 year old man is some sort of predator whereas the 35 year old woman is only misguided.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.6
In keeping with this the 14 year old girl was taken advantage of whereas the 14 year old boy was lucky.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.7
Note that in both cases the sex was consensual, obviously not legally, but in the sense that there wasn't any physical compulsion.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.8
So i'm not saying if a 14 year boy was forcibly touched by a woman it would be ok.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.9
I had a discussion about this with my girlfriend, she thinks both are serious.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.10
I agree, but also seem to have this almost sexist view that the boy was really hurt at all.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.11
What do you guys think?
DF-200-192446-380_7888.12
Is it sexism or is sex between teenage boys and older woman just fundamentally different?
DF-200-192446-380_7888.13
I think it seems less serious because 14-year-old boys talk about having sex with an "older woman" as if it were an achievement.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.14
Whereas to a 14-year-old girl, if an older man was interested in her she'd consider him a dirty pervert.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.15
Therefore it seems unlikely that the girl consented, whereas most would believe the boy would be very much up for it.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.16
Well suppose the 14 year old girl felt the guy loved her and wanted to have sex with him.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.17
It still seems that it's worse because for some reason i'd think the man had manipulated her in some way whereas in the other case i wouldn't really feel the boy had been duped.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.18
I think this isn't a good way to think about it but it seems fairly prevalent.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.19
Yes, I saw that.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.20
My point is, people wouldn't believe that. That's why it seems worse.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.21
Girl: "But i wanted sex with him!" - most would assume she was brainwashed, groomed.
DF-200-192446-380_7888.22
Boy: "But I wanted sex with her!" - most would assume that yes, he probably did.
DF-200-192446-380_7922.1
Anyone else think it's a bit ridiculous that this man actually got arrested for making a monkey gesture?
DF-200-192446-380_7922.2
It didn't hurt anyone, and whilst it may be offensive to some, surely this isn't an arrestable offence?
DF-200-192446-380_7922.3
I mean, where's the line between Un-PC and Illegal?
DF-200-192446-380_7922.4
No, I don't think it was ridiculous.
DF-200-192446-380_7922.5
Whilst no one wants to stop banter, the intention of this was clear: to cause offence.

What I don't understand is in the film Hot Fuzz, one of the detectives, who was white, called Nick Frost, who is also white, a monkey.
DF-200-192446-380_7922.14
Now, unless I'm missing something here, I'm pretty sure Nick Frost isn't black, and monkey means black person, doesn't it?
DF-200-192446-380_7922.15
So what was this detective using the word 'monkey' for if it wasn't to mean black person?
DF-200-192446-380_7922.16
I'm terribly confused.
DF-200-192446-380_7981.1
it's short but if you don't want to read it basically a guy in the USA has been arrested for agreeing to meet up with and have sex with a "14 year old girl" who was actually an undercover cop...
DF-200-192446-380_7981.2
surely this is entrapment?
DF-200-192446-380_7981.3
he didn't actually do anything because they basically lead him into the situation?
DF-200-192446-380_7981.4
sure, it would be a crime if he had actually done this with a 14 year old and something had happened when they met up...
DF-200-192446-380_7981.5
but the american police have basically created this whole scenario and lead him into it, feeding him along?
DF-200-192446-380_7981.6
this suggests to me that the police officer was the one who suggested everything...
DF-200-192446-380_7981.7
coaxed him into it...
DF-200-192446-380_7981.8
we don't know the full story but i get the impression that this "14 year old girl" offered him sex on a plate willingly....
DF-200-192446-380_7981.9
would that be legal in this country?
DF-200-192446-380_7981.10
i mean i think it's wrong that this guy would meet up with a 14 year old with the intent to have sex...
DF-200-192446-380_7981.11
but fabricating the situation... you can't arrest someone for something they haven't done... it's just wrong...
DF-200-192446-380_7981.12
am i the only one who thinks this is messed up?
DF-200-192446-380_7981.13
From previous similar stories, what usually happens is that the undercover officer behind the screen is extremely passive (as a normal young innocent teenager would probably be) and then agrees to meet up with the potential paedophile, if he shows up at the place then he is guilty.
DF-200-192446-380_7981.14
I see nothing wrong with this morally, he knows the girl is 14 and still decides to meet her (having previously stated his intentions through IM).
DF-200-192446-380_7981.15
if that is the case then i understand and agree, it's just the way the article is written it sounds as if the police officer is doing a lot of the work, and it's in america so different laws to here.
DF-200-192446-380_7981.16
They do this and it works, there is even a show about it.
DF-200-192446-380_7981.17
To me its fine, if the suspect has to make a choice, ie leave his home and go to a location, then I don't really care if he is encouraged.

DF-200-192446-380_8068.3
Something that struck me watching a question time debate on this issue was the attitude of some English people, such as the obnoxious Mail journalist on the panel, that Scottish independence was good because then we wouldn't have to subsidise them for being poor.
DF-200-192446-380_8068.4
He even made some kind of play on words involving the word "skint".
DF-200-192446-380_8068.5
Scotland probably receives more than its fair share of UK government spending in terms of its share of the population.
DF-200-192446-380_8068.6
I believe this is because it is, on average, poorer than England.
DF-200-192446-380_8068.7
The way some English people sneer at the Scots for being poor and therefore receiving more government spending wouldn't, I presume, be directed at poor areas of England.
DF-200-192446-380_8068.8
The north, Wales, the south-west, east London and many other areas of the UK get more than their proportional share of spending, because they need it.
DF-200-192446-380_8068.9
I think it's wrong to resent the Scottish poor for being Scottish, because I'm sure such complaints wouldn't be made about poor regions of England.
DF-200-192446-380_8068.10
I was also annoyed by a woman in the audience who said Scotland should be independent (she was English) because "all countries should be independent", including Wales and "Ireland".

But I recognise there are convincing political and economic reasons the SNP have for independence and I don't think Lord Ashdown's reponse on QT of "we're stronger together" had enough real substance to it.
DF-200-192446-380_8068.23
I support him, but Unionists need to express in more real terms why we're stronger together.

Another interesting issue is the advantage to the Tories if Labour-dominated Scotland breaks away.
DF-200-192446-380_8068.25

And then there's the issue of timing.

As Scots are we really so different that we'd toss aside the political, cultural and economic benefits of the union so that we can massage our own egos and yell "FREEDOM!"?

There was an SNP canvaser at my door today, so my mum decided to annoy him, and told him she voted tory... for which he had no response and got all flustered, then when asked which party she would vote for in the next election she said she didn't vote for a party, she voted for a person, and he got confused, then she said she wouldn't vote for independence, and he was genuinely surprised and didn't know what to say
DF-200-192446-380_8068.43
The SNP seem to think that just because they won the election it means that the whole country wants independence, when actually they probably won the election because they wanted free prescriptions, free tuition, free care for the elderly etc. while other parties weren't offering as much (although, it does beg the question of where exactly all this money is coming from?)
DF-200-192446-380_8114.1
Now for a bit of intentional controversial and completely ignorant 'tarring with the same brush' type questions:
DF-200-192446-380_8114.2
is this what 'British' people think?
DF-200-192446-380_8114.3
I know many people don't think like this bitch but this is appaling.
DF-200-192446-380_8114.4
should she have her kid taken away from her?
DF-200-192446-380_8114.5
You see the other 'British' woman didn't defend the others but was more concerned with having to take care of her baby that was about to wake up, which means one 'British' woman was being racist, and the other 'British' woman was just letting it pass, being more worried about something else.
DF-200-192446-380_8114.6
So does that mean that most 'British' woman think like this?
DF-200-192446-380_8114.7
You also have to admit that the lady arguing with the raving bitch had no reason to say 'We're here because you don't work, go find a job', that's wrong and a bit racist within itself.

DF-200-192446-380_8114.17
I actually think she has something wrong with her, whether she is on drugs or drunk.
DF-200-192446-380_8114.18
But she is slurring a lot.
DF-200-192446-380_8114.19
The fact she called Nigeria... Nygigreeah.... I think she was half with it...

DF-200-192446-380_8114.21

DF-200-192446-380_8114.24
1. She actually did, by telling the loud mouthed cow to shut up.
DF-200-192446-380_8114.25
2. Although she shouldn't have to, why do you think she has to get involved?
DF-200-192446-380_8114.26
Just because she is British?
DF-200-192446-380_8114.27
3. Several other people, who weren't British didn't get involved... does that make them racist too..?
DF-200-192446-380_8114.28
4. If I were in that situation, and I had a child with me, I would try my hardest not to get involved, as it wouldn't be fair on my child.
DF-200-192446-380_8114.29
But if the arguing caused my child to be disturbed, then I would have done the same and got involved.
DF-200-192446-380_8114.30
I agree that what I have watched in this video is sickening, but I disagree with several points you have made.
DF-200-192446-380_8114.31
And I would actually say some of your points are rather racist and offensive to British women.
DF-200-192446-380_8114.32
You may be angry at what you have seen, but that is NO reason to group all British women as racist.

Women have a responsibility to mitigate the risk of bad things happening to them, like any of us.

Most of the words that come out of his mouth these days seem to be trying to lure catholic votes.

It seems that he knows under the current population changes (if it continues) that Ireland will eventually unite.

But how can he possibly 'end sectarianism' if members of his party come out with purely bigotory remarks (such as Ian McMrea's in the summer time)?
DF-200-192446-380_8600.4
How can he possibly change the mind set of unionists who vote for nationalist parties (SDLP) purely to keep SF out of a seat?
DF-200-192446-380_8600.5
How can he change the mindset of hardline nationalists who see SF as traitors and refuse to vote at all?

I think it's a noble aspiration and, yes, unionists need to reach out to Roman Catholics.

There's nothing ideologically unsound about that - after all, most Roman Catholics in Scotland, England and Wales are Unionists, why should history prevent that from being the case in Northern Ireland?

I've not heard his full remarks, just what I garnered from the radio and a couple of short bits in articles, but it really sounded good and - whilst I still can't bring myself to think of the DUP as decent, mainstream and cross-community - I think it's a step in the right direction.

The other 90% are called failures at 11 and sent to an underfunded sink school.
DF-200-192446-380_9230.10
Why is it fair that 10% of children get 90% of the funding?
DF-200-192446-380_9230.11
Grammar schools also don't allow for children to move up if they start working harder, it's much easier to move from the bottom set to the top set within a school than it is to move from the comprehensive to the grammar school.
DF-200-192446-380_9230.12
Everyone deserves the chance for a good education not just the lucky 10% who get into the grammar school based on one exam at the age of 11.

I log into TSR and am greeted by loads of threads about how it's all kicking off in London (and a few scuffles in Brum too ) but no explanation how they started then I go to the BBC site to try and get to the bottom of it but still no explanation!
DF-200-192446-380_9909.4
Basically, a guy got shot in London, police claim he was a gangbanger and shot a police officer, local people claim he was innocent.
DF-200-192446-380_9909.5
initial tests reveal he didn't fire a bullet.
DF-200-192446-380_9909.6
Anyways, this killing led to a riot in Tottenham and people realised they could just break down shop windows and take what they want, and burn cars without being held accountable.
DF-200-192446-380_9909.7
So soon enough it spread to all over London... and now birmingham
DF-200-192446-380_9909.8
So you're saying there is no reason?
DF-200-192446-380_9909.9
They just wanted a riot for riot's sake?
DF-200-192446-380_9909.10
Basically, a man called Mark Duggan was shot to death on Thursday reportedly by police, a bunch of people staged a peaceful protest and from that people have started using violence, looting and setting buildings on fire, and it's getting worse because they're realising that police can't do anything about it.
DF-200-192446-380_9909.11
The papers have it all wrong.
DF-200-192446-380_9909.12
I live right in the middle of this crap, and I know of the sort of people who're getting involved, and it really just boils down to some entitled pricks who've realised that the police won't stop them from nicking things they want if they do it simultaneously, morality be damned.
DF-200-192446-380_9909.13

DF-200-192448-618_9494.3
what do you think?
DF-200-192448-618_9494.4
yes, although I'd like to see a change from first past the post to proportional representation.
DF-200-192448-618_9494.5
Also, to the OP, I'm pretty sure that there are hardly any hereditary peers left in the house of lords
DF-200-192448-618_9494.6
It absolutely is a democratic country.
DF-200-192448-618_9494.7
We have an elected House of Commons which is sovereign.
DF-200-192448-618_9494.8
People point to the inherited monarchy and the llife peerage as signs of not being democratic, but ignore one significant thing:
DF-200-192448-618_9494.9
Many other democratic countries worldwide do not elected their Head of State or their Upper House.
DF-200-192448-618_9494.10
For example: Germany, Italy, Canada, Australia, Japan, Holland, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Czech Republic, Hungary, Greece and many others do not elect the Head of State.
DF-200-192448-618_9494.11
Likewise, Ireland, Canada, Germany, France, Holland, Jamaica and many others do not elect their Upper House - at least not directly.
DF-200-192448-618_9494.12
As long as the elected portion of the State (i.e. the House of Commons) has supreme power, then the democratic imperative is satisfied.
DF-200-192448-618_9494.13
Ironically, having other portions of the State elected will invite deadlock and compromise, and the democratic will of the people will be drowned out in the politicking that will go on.
DF-200-192448-618_9494.14
The Lords increases democracy in the UK - it's a safeguard.
DF-200-192448-618_9494.15
Firslty the Chamber, although it has party politics, is kept in balance so it is not as partisan as the commons.
DF-200-192448-618_9494.16
Secondly it is a chamber of experts which functions in a largely advisory capacity.
DF-200-192448-618_9494.17
Thirdly these guys are lifers, which means they are able to think past the next election for the good of the country.
DF-200-192448-618_9494.18

Okay, not trolling or anything but i have a question.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.2
Why? I understand what both the BNP and EDL want in terms of aspirations and goals, ive studied policies and many responses to them.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.3
But from what i've observed via TSR and many news sources; the way they're trying to achieve them, is largely violent EDIT: specific coverage of EDL, whom seem to make the headlines a little more.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.4
Aggression and hostility is obviously the worst way to go about to get these changes made.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.5
Don't they realise it?
DF-200-192448-618_9512.6
I've seen very little peaceful protests go on, which causes me to question the validity of both the BNP and EDL.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.7
And whether they're genuinely thinking for the better of this country or they just house people who just want a fight, that have the option to jump on the bandwagon of UK politics. Hence this thread.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.8
I'm not blaming anyone, im largely trying to remain neutral.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.9
However, riots and fights take two to tango and there is obviously a massive contribution from the opposing party.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.10
But, im just trying to get a bigger picture here.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.11
I'd like for this to be a calm discussion and an informative thread.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.12
For members and followers of both the EDL and BNP to come and justify their points across so, not just i, but many others can be educated properly on the intentions and the reasoning behind it all. Regards.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.13
First of all, I have no affiliation with the BNP, I find them ridiculous.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.14
But how exactly are they violent?
DF-200-192448-618_9512.15
I mean, aside from the couple of mental members in the past, I haven't seen much violence coming from BNP members.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.16
Infact, overwhelmingly they seem to be the victims of violence and repression.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.17
As for the EDL. Well, the thing is, they were never set up with specific political aims.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.18
They were set up as an angry response to radical Islam and Islamisation, they are a street group, not a Westminster lobby.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.19
Sadly, some of their demo's have been marred by violence.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.20
But an agressive opposition, along with a biased press and press with an agenda make them out to be a lot worse than they are.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.21
That said, they are far from good.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.22
The majority are loutish and don't have any great intellectual capacity, but that doesn't mean you should write them off, or that you should oppose their aims.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.23
People who don't think the BNP are violent don't know **** about the history of the BNP.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.24
Yeah they wear suits now, but in the 80s and early 90s it wasn't a political 'party', it was just a street gang that used to fight with AFA and commit random acts of violence and vandalism against non-whites.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.25
You can't change that history by appearing on Question Time.
DF-200-192448-618_9512.26
And before anyone storms in with the negs and the 'that's just slander where's the evidence of this', Google is your friend, do your own research on the BNP vs AFA and the links between the BNP and the NF, Combat 18, National Socialist Movement etc etc etc
DF-200-192448-618_9563.1
With the Scottish vote generally being a Labour vote (41 of 59 seats) would losing Scotland give The Conservative party a clear advantage?
DF-200-192448-618_9563.2
The Conservatives would lose one MP, were as Labour would lose 41 MP's.
DF-200-192448-618_9563.3
Although Labour would of still won in 2001 without Scotland, The Conservatives would of had a 21 seat majority in the last general election.
DF-200-192448-618_9563.4
As well as this the forthcoming boundary changes will see Labour lose 28 seats compared to 7 for The Conservatives, not to mention union donation caps that would decrease party funding for Labour.
DF-200-192448-618_9563.5
With all the said, and with Conservatives likely to hold a natural majority if Scotland gain independence, would that cause Labour to push further to the right in order to try and steal the Conservative vote and effectively leave behind the working class?
DF-200-192448-618_9563.6
Personally I don't think they'd have much choice.
DF-200-192448-618_9563.7
I am interested in hearing peoples opinions on this.
DF-200-192448-618_9563.8
Unsure tbh, maybe would make the UK slightly more right wing but can't imagen it becoming majorly right.
DF-200-192448-618_9563.9
Conservatives won a majority of the vote (but not a majority of the seats, hmm) in England in 2005 and no doubt many more elections where Labour won in the UK.
DF-200-192448-618_9563.10
Wales are in between.
DF-200-192448-618_9563.11
I wonder how NI would vote if the unionists chose between liblabcon rather then D/UUP
DF-200-192448-618_9563.12
What I find worrying is that you think it is OK for a political party to change its core values and ideals, purely for the sake of gaining power.
DF-200-192448-618_9563.13
Not because they believe in what they are saying.
DF-200-192448-618_9563.14
I'm not saying that it doesn't happen already, but you seem to be implying that it is a totally understandable thing to do?
DF-200-192448-618_9563.15
Unless I've misunderstood what you are saying?
DF-200-192448-618_9563.16
Anyway, my personal opinion is that Labour aren't truly left wing and the Conservatives definitely aren't right wing.
DF-200-192448-618_9563.17
They are as bad as each other.
DF-200-192448-618_9563.18
As a 'right wing' person (*cringe*), I sympathise more with some Conservative policies but I don't really like their leadership.
DF-200-192448-618_9563.19
On the other hand, I detest Labour with a passion.
DF-200-192448-618_9563.20

I dunno why but it just boggles my brain.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.3
If the SNP get their way and crown Salmond as king of his own private domain, who determines who is and isn't Scottish?
DF-200-192448-618_9677.4
EU work and residency rights no longer apply following independence, and I can see this potential event doing nothing but fuelling xenophobia, racism and nasty nationalism.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.5
Many English people have Scottish relatives or relatives living in Scotland long term, many Scots move down to England, marry English people or have English relatives.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.6
Who decides if they're Scottish or not?
DF-200-192448-618_9677.7
People who have lived in Scotland for decades could potentially find themselves aliens in their own homes, potentially considered foreign or 'not quite native'.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.8
What about people who consider themselves British living in a British territory suddenly find themselves on the 'wrong' side of the border?
DF-200-192448-618_9677.9
It seems absurd that they should suddenly consider Scotland as somehow 'foreign'.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.10
Residents of other EU countries would suddenly find themselves without EU protections either.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.11
Why is the SNP so obsessed with independence when there is no real political or economic mandate for it?
DF-200-192448-618_9677.12
Surely it has to be for more than some infantile kneejerk obsession with the Brave-heart movie and a unjustified grievance with highly slanted views on history?
DF-200-192448-618_9677.13
Scotland gains nothing but gets lumped with stupid debt and political fallout, loss of influence and still economically and culturally tied to the rest of the UK as to make an international border seem utterly insane.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.14
The Scots themselves are an amalgamation of different peoples, Picts, Britons, Gaels, Norse and even Anglo-Saxons.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.15
It's ironic that some Scots take issue with the United Kingdom while ignoring that Scotland was created in much the same fashion.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.16
So TSR, who decides what a Scot in a 'free' Scotland is?
DF-200-192448-618_9677.17
Someone that has a heritage that clearly shows that the family have been in Scotland for a long time they are Scottish obviously although I am sure that someone born there would also be considered Scottish as well?
DF-200-192448-618_9677.18
the only people who are not Scottish would be those who move there à la not born there or have any previous family who were born in Scotland.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.19
As for who decides that could be tricky although I doubt it will be much of an issue.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.20
I don't see the situation being any different to the relationship between the UK and Ireland.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.21
It wouldn't really matter if someone is a Scottish citizen or a UK citizen, because they will have equal rights in both countries.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.22
Right now Irish citizens can freely live in the UK and can vote in general elections and even run for office.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.23
I'm sure the same thing would happen with Scotland.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.24
It does still raise the question of exactly who can get Scottish citizenship, but it won't really make any practical difference to people who don't qualify for it.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.25
Scottish citizenship would probably be open to people living in Scotland on the day it becomes independent, and anyone who has at least one grandparent who was born there, or something like that.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.26
Look at Irish citizenship laws, it would probably end up being quite similar.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.27
Its an interesting question.
DF-200-192448-618_9677.28
I was born in Scotland to parents who were born and raised in England, but then my mothers side (she's an Anderson) has a long history of Scottish ancestry.

In recent times and quite a bit more in the past it has always been heavily played on that UK prisoners are some if the most expensive people to keep in the UK.
DF-200-192448-618_9741.2
So I was thinking, why aren't we making the people who have the ability to pay (ie- those people who have any sort of savings or credits) to stay in prison?
DF-200-192448-618_9741.3
Some prisoners are in prison with large amounts of money in the bank so why aren't we taking money back off of these people to cover the costs involved in keeping them and court costs?
DF-200-192448-618_9741.4
If people commit the crime people should be willing to do the time and the people who can afford it, should pay for it surely?
DF-200-192448-618_9741.5
What are other peoples views?
DF-200-192448-618_9741.6
Yeah man totally agree man they should register to a Student Loan alternative man and then like, sort of pay it off after their time in jail innit, i'm gonna buy the domain PrisonLoans.co.uk now before anybody else smart steals it
DF-200-192448-618_9741.7
The law should treat everyone equally - You can't have some people paying and others not.
DF-200-192448-618_9741.8
I agree with you that those that can should be able to pay.
DF-200-192448-618_9741.9
However this also raises the issue that since they are paying money as well as serving their time in jail, their sentence should be reduced.
DF-200-192448-618_9741.10
If this were to happen, would it not be unfair that other prisoners that do not have the means to pay and have committed 'lesser' crimes have to serve longer than those that can 'buy' their way out of jail, so to speak?
DF-200-192448-618_9839.1
Taking HIV as an example, the immigrant population has ten times the level of infection of the other 88% of the UK.
DF-200-192448-618_9839.2
The other diseases are even more extremely biased.
DF-200-192448-618_9839.3
What are your thoughts on this situation?
DF-200-192448-618_9839.4
Personally I think it's a very good thing, since our NHS should be working to treat all of the world's sick people and the more diseased immigrants we have, the more good it can do for them.
DF-200-192448-618_9839.5
Also, having them living among us massively increases the risk of infection for the general population, making for a fair society.
DF-200-192448-618_9839.6
Why should we get to enjoy relatively low risk of serious infections when other parts of the world are in great danger of them?
DF-200-192448-618_9839.7
Testing immigrants as a condition of entry to the UK would set us back decades and is morally wrong anyway.
DF-200-192448-618_9839.8
Their health status is none of our business.
DF-200-192448-618_9839.9
Yeah it is something that we should keep an eye on but what about people without medical record?
DF-200-192448-618_9839.10
What do we do with them quarantine them while we wait on test results?
DF-200-192448-618_9839.11
I'm surprised that we don't do this anyway.
DF-200-192448-618_9839.12
Surely, as a matter of common sense, if we get plenty of people from countries where diseases like HIV and TB are rife, it's best to test for it and treat them upon arrival?
DF-200-192448-618_9839.13
Both to prevent them spreading it to the rest of the population and also for the welfare of the affected immigrants.
DF-200-192448-618_9839.14
How is that an infringement on human rights...?
DF-200-192448-618_9839.15
Coming to the UK is a choice.
DF-200-192448-618_9839.16
We already impose conditions on entry, why would one more be wrong?
DF-200-192448-618_9839.17
The problem is that you'd have to pay to deport immigrants who fail the tests when they refuse to leave of their own accord.
DF-200-192448-618_9840.1
So, I've been reading about Scottish independence and I don't think it's fair to solely concentrate on Scottish independence and I'd like to get the overall views of TSR members.
DF-200-192448-618_9840.2
Simple choice, either independence for your home country or to retain membership of the UK.
DF-200-192448-618_9840.3
On the one hand, the union gives us a bigger economy and population, and if it broke up we'd be less powerful.
DF-200-192448-618_9840.4
On the other hand it's a good way to get rid of 5 million Labour voters and let the predominantly Conservative England free itself of Scotland's socialist yoke.
DF-200-192448-618_9840.5
So I'm not really bothered either way.
DF-200-192448-618_9851.1
So I disagree with the whole Tory ethos, and can't stand what they're doing to this country out of sheer idealogy blahblahblah...
DF-200-192448-618_9851.2

Why? Because they were raped by Gordon Brown.

Around 2% of British people are mixed race.

Tony Blair defended his immigration policies a couple of months back and I have to say I agree with him.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.2
I've always viewed immigration's goal was to try change Britain's demographics and making it a fairer society in the long run.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.3
IMO we have become a more mulitcultural nation, and and an ethnically richer diverse one at that which was necessary.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.4
Changing the demographics is important for Britain, it's important for a lot of nations.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.5
To those anti-immigrant nationalists who hate this, look at Obama, probably one of the most popular human beings of all time, if not the most popular ever.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.6

DF-200-192448-618_9860.7
Obama's mixed race background highlights humanities love for mixed race people and our destiny to wanting to become mixed race.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.8
There is no doubt this is the way the world is going.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.9

DF-200-192448-618_9860.10
Stunning president.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.11
So Tony Blair was right about immigration, and we are becoming more diverse thankfully, like America, because of it.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.12
And maybe one day too we will have our own Obama.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.13

Thank you Tony Blair.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.15
Where Tony Blair and his government got it wrong was in underestimating the number who would migrate from the new countries in the EU, and not then providing the resources to support this, for example in English language support in schools.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.16
For non-EU migrants and those seeking to live in the country, the support and resources to enable decisions on their future to be made in a short period of time.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.17
Depends on if you believe Blair did it for electoral reasons or not.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.18
Immigration is good for a society, but opening the floodgates like he did is quite frankly dangerous.

DF-200-192448-618_9860.22
Also, in reality, it's not mixed at all.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.23
I promise you that Obama is an anomaly.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.24
Most of America is about as mixed race as Roy Chubby Brown.
DF-200-192448-618_9860.25
You mostly get concentrated ghettos with black people and then entire states full of white people.

my father comes from an immigrant background, and i dont think am bigoted for wanting to see lower immigration levels.
DF-200-192448-618_9862.4
i also think its stupid that our european friends can immigrate to britian and seek benefits, and denying them that would be against "human rights"....according to the eu court of human rights.
DF-200-192448-618_9862.5
Am i racist and bigoted for these views ?
DF-200-192448-618_9862.6
No, saying that immigration levels are high is an observation and wanting lower immigration levels is what many people want
DF-200-192448-618_9862.7
Everybody knows the rate of immigration is too high but it's not really what you say, just how you say it.
DF-200-192448-618_9862.8
Your beliefs don't stem from believing your race is superior, or that immigrants or other races are inferior, but 'your racism' is arguable in regards to prejudice, discrimination and antagonism (also part of racism).
DF-200-192448-618_9862.9
Not saying that you are, I am saying that is open to question and has grounds depending on how you go about these beliefs.
DF-200-192448-618_9862.10
For example, if you made an unjust distinction of someone because they are an immigrant, not quite sure if that would make you a fully fledged racist, but it certainly would be discrimination.
DF-200-192448-618_9862.11
Basically there is a thin line.
DF-200-192448-618_9862.12
Sucks but life is sometimes politically correct, but you have to learn to deal with it because you never know when you're the one going to be on the other side of the spectrum.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.1
OK, so I am still learning about how the free market/ global energy supply system works so please correct me if I am wrong, but here is my suggestion;
DF-200-192448-618_9882.2
All state services including social housing, libraries, hospitals, schools, prisons etc should be powered by British energy only and everything the state uses (construction materials, food etc) should be British produced, grown and maintained by a British workforce.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.3
Alongside this, we open up the private sector to imports and freedom of choice, luxuries etc.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.4
The private sector can do pretty much whatever it wants but the state must be able to support itself with or without the boom and bust of the private sector.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.5
People who choose to live on benefits (rely on the state) will only have access to British resources also.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.6
(British grown) food will be provided for survival as will housing and energy but (imported) luxuries will not be available to those dependent on the state.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.7
If people desire luxury, then they must work for it.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.8
The idea being that the state pays (modest) salaries for its workers who consume British energy (retrieving this money through taxes from British workers) and British food/ materials.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.9
This would effectively create a system which circulated resources within the country rather than it being channelled out into the hands of Russian billionaires.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.10
The energy will be supplied through wind turbines positioned offshore around the British isles which are maintained by idle military personnel.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.11
Further, a production workforce will be employed by the State in factories to produce said materials.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.12
Edit: Why is everyone negging me?
DF-200-192448-618_9882.13
I'm trying to offer a solution to a problem.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.14
And this will be paid for with what?
DF-200-192448-618_9882.15
So no library books from non-British authors?
DF-200-192448-618_9882.16
I think that demonstrates how quickly this idea is a fail.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.17
Also not too sure why you don't think pensioners should be allowed to buy themselves a bottle of champagne for their 80th birthday party either.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.18
That sounds like an awful lot of Government intervention.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.19
Your ideas are crazy and would mean the death of the free market.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.20
You have to let the free market work.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.21
And then consider the burden on the tax payer....
DF-200-192448-618_9882.22
The market should decide,
DF-200-192448-618_9882.23
if the people want British goods they will buy British goods.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.24
If they want foreign goods they will buy those instead,
DF-200-192448-618_9882.25
it certainly isn't in the States interest to increase costs substantially by going exclusively for British goods of all kinds,
DF-200-192448-618_9882.26
they should go for the cheapest best quality goods instead.
DF-200-192448-618_9882.27
This is not a dictatorship.

You cannot force suppliers to sell products for no profit

There are aspects of self reliance which would be good but on the whole protectionism is not a good long term policy to follow.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.1
I've really never understood this mentality.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.2
Here's the crucial fact: we import more FROM other EU member states than we export TO them.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.3
Any tariffs they impose would hurt French, German, Spanish and Italian businesses more than it would hurt us.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.4
The EU is fundamentally committed (this is stated in one of its treaties I believe) to fostering good relations and free trade with non-members, especially those which maintain high standards of human rights and democracy (now ain't that ironic).
DF-200-192448-619_0017.5
So if we left the EU, we could negotiate free trade agreements individually with the union and its members; we could join/remain in the EEC; or we could join the EFTA (EEC-lite).
DF-200-192448-619_0017.6
We'd have a range of options, all of which would keep our trade with Europe strong and healthy.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.7
Will politicians in Germany and France want to stop Brits from buying up their countries' BMWs, Mercs, Audis, VWs, Peugeots, Renaults, and so on?
DF-200-192448-619_0017.8
I very highly doubt it - not a vote-winner.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.9
As well as maintaining our trade levels, if we left the EU we could save the several billion pounds we donate to the EU each year, reduce immigration to more viable levels, and shun some of the more overbearing aspects of EU bureaucracy, all of which would benefit our economy substantially.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.10
Oh, and I forgot to mention that it's predicted that the EU's share of world trade and prosperity is going to massively decline over the coming decades.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.11
So why is everyone terrified of leaving because of trade?
DF-200-192448-619_0017.12
The EU probably deflects as much trade as it creates.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.13
Because we are part of the EU we trade more with members of the EU, such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland because we have a common market.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.14
However what this means is that we trade less with nations like China, Brazil, India, Japan and America.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.15
I am not convinced we want to attatch ourselves to the overly indebted nations of Europe.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.16
I would rather trade with the up and coming emerging economies.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.17
However as part of the EU you do get the appreciable benefit of free trade within the EU area.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.18
However it is starting to look like the members of the monetary union are going to try and exploit the common market member ones eg. The Tobin Tax.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.19
In the very long run I think being outside of Europe and trading with the emerging economies, which will eventually become the big economies, is wiser.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.20
I agree with the Europhiles that it's important to trade and work together so the people of Europe can collectively raise their standard of living, it's just that the EU has proven to be a corrupt power hungry entity that has a socialist doctrine at it's core so it's not an ideal long term trading partner.
DF-200-192448-619_0017.21

I need reasons for why drugs should NOT be legalised, any help please?
DF-200-192448-619_0116.2
i'm for drug legalisation.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.3
The Government has absolutely no right to say what I can and can't do with my body, as well as what I put in it.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.4
We should be helping those who use drugs, not punishing them.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.5
You could make the point that by making drugs legal and creating potentially a bigger market for their use that food crops could be replaced in developing countries for drug crops much like the increase of demand for bio fuel has done, thus increasing food prices making impoverished people even poorer and increasing inflation of food products which are bad for most consumers so drugs actually have a massive impact on none drug users!
DF-200-192448-619_0116.6
The problem with both of us is that neither of us specified which drugs we are talking about.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.7
Some drugs such as heroin are clearly awful - I certainly hope that you agree it is addictive and does harm others.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.8
Some drugs have much less of a negative effect on the individual and other people around them.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.9
Cannabis being mentally addictive is still addiction.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.10
The addiction may very well be weaker.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.11
I agree, the government should help drug addicts.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.12
I believe that drug addicts should be forced to enrol on some sort of a program which is created to help them whether that would be in prison or otherwise.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.13
(I also believe that smoking should be banned )
DF-200-192448-619_0116.14
I think we're all for legalizing drugs until you meet the poor guys/gals who aren't from middle class/higher class families and can't afford rehab (this coming from a lower-middle class guy) who are sleeping on the streets in the winter in the snow before eventually dying.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.15
Drugs aren't good and aren't necessary, and ruin tons of peoples lives.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.16
I have used drugs in the past and will probably do so sometime in the future, but it shouldn't be legalized.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.17
Everybody seems to forget about you know, the large amount of money spent in hospitals treating drug users.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.18
Besides this, saying the government shouldn't tell us what to do, well I hate every single politician, but using that arguement just makes people sound like children.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.19
Perhaps reform, with more punishment on drug dealers would be good.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.20
If you want to get philosophical, I will tell you what I believe to be the most detrimental effect of any recreational drug.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.21
Recreational drugs cause euphoria.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.22
Hence, drugs are an artificial substitute for a natural incentive that has evolved to motivate our species to do what necessary for it's survival.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.23
There are natural states in which humans can experience these sensations.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.24
We come with built in mechanisms which produce these affects when appropriate.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.25
This is ultimately why your body may produce some version of these chemicals naturally.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.26
These chemical reactions are usually triggered by behaviors which are positive in terms of species propagation.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.27
An example of such behaviors would be accomplishing a task, or making a personal connection with another.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.28
Recreational drugs are a waste because it is counter productive to nature, to society, and to your personal growth to have access to undeserved bliss.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.29
If we were capable of producing a drug which induced intense euphoria, with no side effects, no adverse health risks, and was infinitely available, It would be catastrophic to our society.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.30
It is easy for drug users to delude themselves into believing that the health risks are minimal when they are partying and having so much fun.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.31
The biggest delusion of all is the one that most overlook.
DF-200-192448-619_0116.32
We are not naturally meant to feel that good without achieving something to improve our existence.
DF-200-192448-619_0324.1
I already know the kinds of responses I'm going to get to this thread, almost by definition, because as far as I can tell you can split the English public into two groups when it comes to Scottish independence; a majority who don't care above some vague notion that Scotland probably costs them money, and a very vocal swivel eyed unionist minority for whom Scottish independence marks the beginning of the end of their pseudo-colonial ambitions.
DF-200-192448-619_0324.2
So I want to ask that crowd, and I already know they are going to be chomping at the bit to just click reply already, but I specifically want to know what it is you want out of the Union; I don't want to hear about how Scotland would be worse off somehow etc. etc. just why you want the UK to remain the UK and not split.

Personally, I think it's best to let the Scots have their independence within 5 years, but before such plans are published we should drill for all the oil they have and use it to pay off our debts.
DF-200-192448-619_0324.12
After that if there are any remaining debts they should be given around 1/3 of it.

As I was writing a post in another topic earlier about Russia and their right to be a superpower, my mind rambled a bit and I started to wonder if Great Britain can ever become a political superpower on the international stage again.
DF-200-192448-619_0441.2
90 years ago, the British Empire was accountable for approximately 25% of the entire worlds population, and Britain had control of 25% of the worlds landmass, therefore being able to completely dictate trade routes and international relations.
DF-200-192448-619_0441.3
A lot has changed in 90 years, clearly.
DF-200-192448-619_0441.4
In 2008, Great Britian controls very little in the way of overseas territories, and have a population of only 58,000,000 residents, many having moved into the UK from other countries.
DF-200-192448-619_0441.5
We also seem to be losing the ability to defend ourselves politically, being subservient to the United States in their quest to capture resources, and being a part of the European Union, often have to accept group decisions that the country does not agree with or benefit from in any way.
DF-200-192448-619_0441.6
So, with all this in mind, can Britain ever become a superpower again if desired?
DF-200-192448-619_0441.7
I know that we clearly will never compete with China in terms of population, but is there any way to maximise the economic power of the nation in order to compete in terms of financial position and ability to develop and expand faster and more sustainably than other nations?

Also, what would be the positives and negatives for the general population if it ever were to happen?
DF-200-192448-619_0441.9
You could make a case for the UK being a financial superpower, we punch way above our weight politically and we have one of the best trained militaries in the world.
DF-200-192448-619_0441.10
Yet superpower in the old sense of the word, basically being a colonial or military superpower, is something I think is out of our reach for very obvious and in my opinion desirable reasons.
DF-200-192448-619_0441.11
The best way the UK can stay on the world stage is doing what it does now, being pretty much the top in the service industries.
DF-200-192448-619_0441.12
The British Empire was probably the greatest the world has ever known.
DF-200-192448-619_0441.13
It was also one of the most brutal and morally abhorrent.

DF-200-192448-619_0772.1
The numerous train operating companies in Britain make our rail system confusing.
DF-200-192448-619_0772.2
They encourage high fares so that they can make profit, but do very little to invest in the network ultimatly leaving Britain with the highest rail fares in Europe with one of the poorest services.
DF-200-192448-619_0772.3
Meanwhile, in other European countries such as France and Germany, the rail network is nationalised.
DF-200-192448-619_0772.4
They benefit from low fares and quaility services composed of many 'high speed' routes.
DF-200-192448-619_0772.5
Privatisation in Britain was supposed to encourage competition and therefore drive drown fares but I don't see how competition on the railways works as each company usually has a monopoly on the route they serve
DF-200-192448-619_0772.6
(Eg. If you want to go from Nottingham to London you can only use the East midlands Trains)
DF-200-192448-619_0772.7
So, do you think that we should re-nationalise the railways and base the network on the French-German model of low fares and high quality? I certainly do!
DF-200-192448-619_0772.8
We can't afford it right now.
DF-200-192448-619_0772.9
Anyway if we had the money yes. Not this idiotic subsidized monopoly
DF-200-192448-619_0772.10
What happened to that company that walked away from one of it's franchises a couple years back?
DF-200-192448-619_0772.11
I remember the government (Lord Adonis I think) said it was going to be punished, did anything ever happen?
DF-200-192448-619_0772.12
Financially it may not be viable at present, but nationalisation ought to be a long term aim.
DF-200-192448-619_0772.13
Privatising the railways was arguably the worst thing the Tories did.
DF-200-192448-619_0772.14
In the meantime we need more regulation, especially with regards to fares, which are disgracefully high.
DF-200-192448-619_0772.15
I support deregulation, and I am completely opposed to nationalisation.
DF-200-192448-619_0772.16
in a time of economic downturn, you want to nationalise the rail network so the public sector (who is already faced with billions of pounds worth of cuts) has to finance the entire network, including maintenance, investment and subsidies? No thanks!
DF-200-192448-619_0772.17
Deregulation or Privatisation FTW.....or even just how it is right now....our rail network isn't that bad to be brutally honest,
DF-200-192448-619_0772.18

So we've all been hearing a lot about super-injunctions being littered all over the news, although one thing has struck me, that applies in almost all other European countries apart from us: The defendant is always anonymous until proven guilty.
DF-200-192448-619_0961.2
I think that until the defendant is proven to be guilty, they should be completely anonymous, to prevent false arrests getting out into public and denting one's reputation, as it is almost a form of defamation.
DF-200-192448-619_0961.3
I don't think it's fair that cases are so publicized, and should only be so open if the defendant doesn't mind.
DF-200-192448-619_0961.4
It is weird how people proven to be innocent are still hated because of the accused crime, like the stigma of being called a paedophile even though it can literally happen to anyone and everyone.
DF-200-192448-619_0961.5
Would help if the media made a big thing about them being innocent, but most people are stupid generally, else this problem would not exist.
DF-200-192448-619_0961.6
If you look at that Joanna Yeates case, everyone had decided that landlord was guilty up to the point where people hated him and the media was slaughtering him.

DF-200-192448-619_1152.4
Don't vote for AV because you think it will help one party more than another.
DF-200-192448-619_1152.5
Vote for AV because you think it will be more fair. If AV results in more BNP MPs, because more people in our country support the BNP, I think that's fair enough.
DF-200-192448-619_1152.6
We live in a democracy after all, people should be allowed to vote for who they like and everyone's vote should count.
DF-200-192448-619_1152.7
Honestly I hate these freaking 'Vote AV and the Tories won't get in!' arguments, they're so idiotic and not even true.
DF-200-192448-619_1289.1
UK peoples- Who else here thinks we should use the Single Transferable Vote as our electoral system?
DF-200-192448-619_1289.2
For those of you who don't know what it is, I think STV is the main truly proportional system of electing MPs.
DF-200-192448-619_1289.3
Candidates are numbered similar to AV, but constituencies are multi-member so seats are allocated based on numbers of votes.
DF-200-192448-619_1289.4
It's the system used in EU elections.
DF-200-192448-619_1289.5
I'm one of the few British tories who thinks we should use it, but what do you think?
DF-200-192448-619_1289.6
STV would be my ideal electoral system.
DF-200-192448-619_1289.7
The whole constituency link issue would be less important if we had more localised politics.
DF-200-192448-619_1289.8
I was sympathetic to STV, but then it seems that in the recent Irish elections it's just as vulnerable to disproportionalities as FPTP...
DF-200-192448-619_1289.9
Stv is far and above the most fair system in my opinion.

Invade Libya.
DF-200-192448-619_1297.2
Think about it, what does Britain have that there is a potentially lucrative demand for?
DF-200-192448-619_1297.3
The answer, a well trained and heavily equipped military, which although short on numbers at the moment, could easily be bolstered in a very short period of time.
DF-200-192448-619_1297.4
The Libyan rebels are crying out for assistance in overthrowing Gadaffi, so I say we make them an offer.
DF-200-192448-619_1297.5
We'll send an army of 100,000 troops to take Tripoli, and in return they will provide us with a promise of a fee - say, 30% of all Libyan oil revenue for the next 15 years.
DF-200-192448-619_1297.6
So not only will the invasion create British jobs, take people off the streets, provide invaluable battle-field experience and be self-financing....it could actually be PROFIT MAKING!
DF-200-192448-619_1297.7
A 30% stake of ALL Libyan oil revenue over the next 15 years could be worth tens of billions of pounds.

DF-200-192448-619_1297.11
100,000 troops There's barely that many soldiers and officers in the entire army, most of whom are not frontline but rather logistics, intelligence, engineering personnel and so forth.
DF-200-192448-619_1297.12
You'd have to start giving sailors and aircrew rifles and combat gear.
DF-200-192448-619_1297.13
We are doing enough as it is in Libya, anything further we can do must be humanitarian (supplying medical and food supplies to Misrata, for example) or logistical (supplying training and weapons to the rebels in Ajdabiya so they stop sucking)
DF-200-192448-619_1297.14
OP I think you underestimate how long it would take to train and equip 100,000 soldiers then all the logistics and other such things that an army would need.
DF-200-192448-619_1297.15
If you are going to do it well I'd say at least 5 to 10 years.
DF-200-192448-619_1297.16

I'm not insulting politicians here; I'm defending them for once.
DF-200-192448-619_1298.2
I always feel that people are impossible to please when it comes to how politicians appear in public.
DF-200-192448-619_1298.3
Take the TV debates for example: everyone hated Dave's "down with the people" and "I met a black man the other day..." act, but at the same time, had he remained aloof and failed to engage with anyone, he would have aggravated another group of people, and been called a toff even more.
DF-200-192448-619_1298.4
Another example is that recent departure lounge picture, which everyone decried as a fake.
DF-200-192448-619_1298.5
Again, it's a lose lose situation: some say it was staged publicity, which is bad; others say it was genuine, but the whole holiday was a pathetic attempt to pretend that "we're all in it together"; others still would doubtless complain if Dave flew off first class to a five star resort instead of using Ryanair to go to some four star place in Spain (or wherever it was).
DF-200-192448-619_1298.6
This isn't unique to the Tories, those were just the examples which sprang to mind.
DF-200-192448-619_1298.7
Sometimes I find satire a bit annoying, because it means that politicians can never seem to do anything right.
DF-200-192448-619_1298.8
I wish people would keep the debate on policies and ability/desire to deliver them, not who's a toff or who's flying which airline or holidaying in which place, or using certain mannerisms to respond to questions.
DF-200-192448-619_1298.9

Well, you know, I doubt whether some of these "hard working" politicians would last very long if they had to work on a building site carrying bricks or steel gurders for 10 hours a day, or even work a 9-5 carrying heavy frozen meat produce from one cage to another 7 days a week.

DF-200-192448-619_1299.4
I hope to God the AV referendum returns a big fat NO so that this horrid left wing coalition can be returned to the dust and we can finally get on with real, Tory leadership (thanks to First Past The Post, of course).

What has first past the post got to do with having a Tory government?
DF-200-192448-619_1299.6
The problem for the Tories isn't the electoral system its that they don't have enough widespread support in the electorate.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.7
We had first past the post last time, the country was on its knees and we had had 13 years of Labour government, with Labour's popularity at rock bottom.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.8
But still the Tories didn't have enough support to get a majority under FPTP.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.9
Now the Tories are facing the unpopularity of government and Labour are ahead on the opinion polls.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.10
The Lib Dem vote will collapse but I bet more of their vote goes to Labour/Greens than it does the Tories.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.11
I think the UK was a broadly Tory nation up till the 1990s but since then it has turned against them, they had their lowest ever days in the mid-late 1990s and early 2000s, even since they've had an upturn on the back of a Labour government running into problems, they've not been able to build a broad base of support in the country like MacMillan or Thatcher did.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.12
The tories didn't get a majority because labour fixed the boundries.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.13
Labour got a majority in 2005 with 9.6 million votes but the tories come short in 2010 despite having 1.1 million more votes than this.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.14
Some analyst reckon the tories needed just another 15,000 votes to get that majority.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.15
I would have voted based on what I thought was best for the country.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.16
If I honestly thought Labour could solve the problem, despite all my problems with them, I would have voted Labour.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.17
But that isn't the case.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.18
But a lot of Labour voters I know/ have met, have told me that they vote Labour because 'Tories only care about the rich'.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.19
And that is it, you ask them why they think that and....nothing.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.20
Or another common reason 'Tories will take away EMA and give the moeny to the rich'.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.21
Well yes, they took away EMA, but EMA was a stupid system anyway, unfair and put in place by the Labour government to try and make unemployment figures look better.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.22
Most Labour voters I know in real life voted for them either out of ignorance and views inherited from their parents/peers.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.23
Or because they wanted their pocket directly lined.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.24
Now, I know this isn't the case for all Labour voters, hell there are some intelligent ones on TSR, who vote for Labour for decent reasons, and though I disagree I respect them for that.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.25
I just feel that Labour get a lot of votes from the reverse-snob working class in areas like mine.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.26
So they can quite literally do anything, and people will still vote for them over the Tories.
DF-200-192448-619_1299.27
I'm fairly right wing, but I don't think a full on tory government is what anyone wants.

As a Labour Party supporter, I disagree with the cuts that the Coalition Government are currently making.
DF-200-192448-619_1397.2
They are going too far, too fast.
DF-200-192448-619_1397.3
Their policy of contractionary fiscal policy creates a substantial risk of the UK slipping back into recession, which means consumer confidence will begin to fall even further, as people will be more likely to save, which leads to less money being pumped into the economy, ie. a fall in aggregate demand.
DF-200-192448-619_1397.4
With current levels of unemployment very high, job losses will be the consequence of these harsh, unnecessary cuts through the Coalition Government's contractionary fiscal policy.
DF-200-192448-619_1397.5
On the other hand, Labour's policy of expansionary fiscal policy means that although the budget deficit will increase, a significant number of jobs will be created, aggregate demand will increase, which means an increase in consumer confidence, therefore household income will increase, which may result in taxpayers moving into a higher tax band, which leads to an increase in Government revenue from taxation.
DF-200-192448-619_1397.6
If we carry on with the current rate of cuts, we will reverse to the 1980's, making the poorest poorer, and the richest richer, same old Tories!
DF-200-192448-619_1397.7
Cuts need to be made at a steady pace, with the budget deficit dealt with once the economy is full steam ahead.

I apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread, but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter.
DF-200-192451-579_6283.2
I'm a British Pakistani, born and brought up in London, however I would say I am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side.
DF-200-192451-579_6283.3
Recently I watched a documentary by Saira Khan 'Don't tell my Mother I am in Pakistan', made a few years ago, yet a very interesting watch.
DF-200-192451-579_6283.4
I have been on holiday to Pakistan a fair amount of times, and have traveled throughout the country, so I thought I had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it's people.
DF-200-192451-579_6283.5
However, after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on Pakistan I am absolutely shocked.
DF-200-192451-579_6283.6
I may be wrong when I say this, but was Pakistan not founded as a Muslim state, yet only 64 years on and I don't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with.
DF-200-192451-579_6283.7
It seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting western culture, in a sense it boosts their superiority complex.
DF-200-192451-579_6283.8
I actually find it shocking, that most families who moved to England in the 60's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in Pakistan.
DF-200-192451-579_6283.9
Drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally I find it quite upsetting, it seems as if Pakistan is moving in the opposite direction- the rich becoming more obsessed with western culture and the less well off being neglected further.

Liberalization is moving in the OPPOSITE direction?
DF-200-192451-579_6283.13
Personally, any nation's judiciary system that is in anyway influenced by objective morality scriptures and superstition has no place in the 21st century.
DF-200-192451-579_6283.14
While I can understand your sentiment that is undesirable for tradition to be dismantled, ever since the fall of the wall in 1989, Liberal democratic values have spread (End of History, Fukuyama, 1992) and that does not preclude (just yet) the sovereign states whom are conformed to Islamic teachings as their rule of law.
DF-200-192451-579_6283.15
Western culture gives people individuality and lets them choose whether to follow conservatism or choose their own destiny and the right to enjoy any liberties they desire (as long as it doesn't harm anybody else).
DF-200-192451-579_6283.16
I think it is the right direction that Western culture (unforced) is spreading, it gives a common ground for different cultures to interact, promotes tolerance and allows people to pick their own way of life.
DF-200-192451-579_6283.17
I don't see that being a problem.

Pakistan was founded on the basis that Muslims felt their interests would not be guarded by a Hindu government, not as some spiritual Muslim homeland.
DF-200-192451-579_6283.22
As it is, I'd hardly say Pakistan is 'Western', what with it's blasphemy laws, it's constant conflict with India, conservative populace, tacit funding and support for various Islamist organisations.

that was a tongue in cheek remark i wasnt being entirely serious.
DF-200-192451-579_6300.24
Largely rhetoric to lay the groundwork to get support for the war.
DF-200-192451-579_6300.25
This wasn't done properly before going to war in Iraq and we had people opposed to it from the start, also going in with mixed messages 'its about WMD and a bit about regime change' looked bad when there weren't any WMD there.
DF-200-192451-579_6300.26
So we need to go in from the start saying with Iran it's about regime change, Ahmedinijad is bad, he doesn't respect womens rights or whatever otherwise you will have the same situation if we say its about nuclear weapons and then go to war and don't find any nuclear weapons.
DF-200-192451-579_6300.27
I can understand the argument that nuclear proliferation is bad and any of these states having nuclear weapons is not desirable as it just leads to proliferation in the region, but that argument should have been used against Pakistan and Israel getting nukes.
DF-200-192451-579_6300.28
People say Iran having nukes is a risk because terrorists might be able to get hold of nuclear material...
DF-200-192451-579_6300.29
well hello...Pakistan has them.
DF-200-192451-579_6300.30
Remember when we went in to take out Bin Laden we couldn't tell the Pakistani government for fear that Bin Laden would have been tipped off and escaped...
DF-200-192451-579_6300.31
that hardly fills me with confidence that they should be allowed to have nuclear weapons.
DF-200-192451-579_6300.32
The problem with these 'resolutions' targeting Iran is that everyone can see the hypocrisy, its a case of our allies can have nukes but others can't.
DF-200-192451-579_6300.33
A much better resolution would have been a hard resolution on non proliferation and disarmament in the region, which meant India and Pakistan had to disarm and Israel had to disarm, and any moves by any country in the region towards getting nuclear weapons would be met by international air strikes.
DF-200-192451-579_6300.34
I could definitely support that as a non proliferation treaty.
DF-200-192451-579_6312.1
I've heard stories of Pakistanis, Indians, Bengalis, Filipinos, Iranians and Arabs with African roots being racially abused in places like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and so on...

Are you a non-Arab minority living in the Middle-East, or do you know someone who did?
DF-200-192451-579_6312.3
Do you feel that the problem of racism is a big or a small one in comparison to places like America (the southern states in particular)?
DF-200-192451-579_6312.4
It's not so much racist, as it is 'classist'.
DF-200-192451-579_6312.5
People from India, Pakistan, and so on often work as maids, drivers, etc. in the middle east.
DF-200-192451-579_6312.6
They don't abuse you because you're a certain skin color, they abuse you because they think you're some servant that barely makes any money and should be grateful for being there.
DF-200-192451-579_6312.7
Yes, there is racism in some Arab countries in the Middle East.
DF-200-192451-579_6312.8
If you are from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh or any country that isn't very rich then you are mostly treated like crap.
DF-200-192451-579_6312.9
However, if you are British, or from the US or any other rich European country then they treat you really well.
DF-200-192451-579_6312.10
Indians in particular are treated badly, there are Indian maids and they are often hit by the house wife if they for example make a small mistake or sometimes they are hit with no reason.
DF-200-192451-579_6312.11
I have relatives who live in one of those rich middle eastern countries and as far as I know they told me that some of them whilst at School have experienced racisms from children for example one of them a girl was called black and ugly and that her hair is bad but the teachers don't do anything about it, they are racist themselves.
DF-200-192451-579_6378.1
I have to admit I am really quite worried about Russia..
DF-200-192451-579_6378.2
In the mainstream media and popular consciousness the big doomsday scenarios mainly centre around Iran and China, obviously both of those are grossly misrepresented, the idea of a US-Chinese war for example is objectively absurd and no serious commentators pay it any attention, it's really just a propaganda tool and an exciting subject for video games.
DF-200-192451-579_6378.3
The situation in Iran has the ability to cause a lot of misery in the middle east but again, Iranian leaders are really quite self aware, they know what they are doing, and there is near enough no risk to the world at large even if they do acquire nuclear weapons of them actually using them, although we as simple peasants obviously need to believe that and go along with our governments because if Iran does become a nuclear power then it will have a lot more independence and influence in the region and that obviously can't be tolerated.
DF-200-192451-579_6378.4
Anyway, Russia, it seems to me, is the real potential doomsday scenario here.
DF-200-192451-579_6378.5
Almost all the conditions of wiemar Germany are present; economic downturn, unemployment, a recent history of loss of empire, rising nationalism and xenophobia.
DF-200-192451-579_6378.6
And just like Germany there is a hard turn to the far right by the country's middle classes and the rise of egomaniacal leaders who are already undermining what little democracy there has been in Russia.

DF-200-192451-579_6378.9

Can anyone explain further or recommend some reading?
DF-200-192451-579_6378.13
Yes, Russia does have huge problems with neo-nazi ideology (which is kind of ironic given the history of Russia).
DF-200-192451-579_6378.14
It's military is pretty brutal as well - see Chechnya.
DF-200-192451-579_6378.15
Russia regularly interferes in it's neighbours (such as the Ukraine and the invasion of Georgia when it became too western), but I don't think it has much power beyond that, that isn't to say that they wouldn't if they could.
DF-200-192451-579_6378.16
But they are hemmed in by China, Europe and the United States.
DF-200-192451-579_6378.17
There is a lot of bitterness about how ex-USSR states have become part of 'The West' (like Poland and Estonia for example).
DF-200-192451-579_6378.18
What specifically are you concerned about?
DF-200-192451-579_6378.19
It isn't going to invade Europe again if that's what you are concerned about.
DF-200-192451-579_6378.20

DF-200-192451-579_6378.21
Their closest "Western" allies are France and Italy (and they are close).
DF-200-192451-579_6378.22
Russia isn't really that close to any major powers.
DF-200-192451-579_6378.23
I disagree with this, at least not without huge structural changes.
DF-200-192451-579_6378.24
It has terrible future demographics (with no available fix through immigration) and is totally dependent on exporting oil and gas - as well as being run by corrupt oligarchs (who make Western corporatism look non-corrupt and benevolent).
DF-200-192451-579_6378.25
I think Russia is pretty neutral about most international affairs now, so I don't see the big worry.
DF-200-192451-579_6378.26

DF-200-192451-579_6386.1
First off, a disclaimer of sorts, these are my opinions based on news reports and a little research around the topic so I apologise if my facts are wrong or inaccurate.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.2
Like the title says I welcome thoughts either on my opinion, or on the matter in question.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.3
Anyone who follows the news will have heard in amidst all the "EU crisis" there is an issue growing between the west and the middle east.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.4
Specifically Iran and its attempt at a nuclear program, where Iran hopes to gain nuclear power for peaceful purposes (Iran's statement).
DF-200-192451-579_6386.5
The US and EU however believe that Iran are using this nuclear program to develop and obtain nuclear weapons claiming they have "information suggesting Iran had carried out tests relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device".
DF-200-192451-579_6386.6
Due to this the US and EU have imposed sanctions on Iran involving limits on the oil bought from Iran which in turn decreases their economy and other sanctions of similar consequences.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.7
Right now that that's done I can state my opinion, please correct anything I have put that is wrong!
DF-200-192451-579_6386.8
My opinion in short is this, the US and EU have no right to impose sanctions on Iran and to deter their nuclear program.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.9
HOWEVER, I am very opposed to Iran gaining nuclear weapons and threatening WW3 and in fact I am opposed to any country having nuclear weapons.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.10
The only argument the US and EU have is that Iran is not a stable country at the moment and a unstable country shouldn't be able to kill millions at the touch of a button.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.11
However for them to tell another country what they can't have, when they have nuclear weapons themselves is nothing except hypocrisy.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.12
From Iran's point of view, one could argue that our governments are unstable with new leaders every 4 years with differing opinions and views.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.13
What right do we have to dictate what another country can and cannot do.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.14
I think that's the essence of my argument, and I accept that the "Iran instability" is a big part of the sanctions.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.15
Thank you for reading and I hope I'm not completely ignorant here!
DF-200-192451-579_6386.16
Why do countries not have a right to tell others what to do?
DF-200-192451-579_6386.17
People tell each other what to do all day every day, why should countries be exempt?
DF-200-192451-579_6386.18
Of course, Iran has every right to say "no", but then those other countries have every right to refuse to trade with them.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.19
Though I don't believe we should have nuclear weapons either - it's not hypocritical as such.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.20
Having a new leader every 4 years doesn't make a country unstable (otherwise Irans single leader would be highly stable).
DF-200-192451-579_6386.21
Most countries who have nuclear weapons now can be trusted not to abuse them - Iran cannot.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.22
Regardless, I personally don't think world security should be held back just because someone is worried about being a bit hypocritical.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.23
I believe that the only reason why American gun sights have been trained on Iran is because of their decision to switch from petro-dollars (American) to the gold standard or something similar.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.24
This would would have a detrimental effect on the American economy, or practically any economy that relies on the dollar as a currency and as a result, the already weak American economy would lose it's leading place.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.25
All the other aspects, nuclear power and oppressive regimes are just a side issue.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.26
This was demonstrated time and time again when Saddam switched to Euros in 2000 and Gaddafi wanted to switch to the gold standard before he was toppled.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.27
The EU also wanted something similar and I don't know what happened to that.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.28
There is still no evidence against Iran.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.29

Also the IAEA publishing the names of all Iraqi nuclear scientists is rather sinister.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.32
They very well knew this is like gold dust to Israel and America ie assassination targets. Impartiality?
DF-200-192451-579_6386.33
I think not.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.34
The hypocrisy argument gets nowhere, but most fail to understand the double standards suggest an ulterior motive, at the least a lack in credibility of the West.
DF-200-192451-579_6386.35

Russia wants stability and a friendly regime to ensure the security of their interests, so they back Assad.

That's Russia for you.

Nevertheless, Assad would be lucky if he survived this year.

It's a similar situation to Libya.
DF-200-192451-579_6409.18
The rebels need help with the big military targets, but when it comes to ground operations, they are more than capable of handling the situation.
DF-200-192451-579_6409.19
If you wish to understand Russia's reasoning, know its national interest.
DF-200-192451-579_6409.20
In this case arms contracts worth $4 Billion is a national interest.

No way are they going to let that go down the drain if they can do something about it.

Nor are they willing to lose face by openly supporting the Syrian regime.
DF-200-192451-579_6409.23
They will just exercise their UN privileges and keep sneaking the promised weapons into Syria one way or the other and keep cashing in on the opportunity.

Personally, I don't think they would start WW3 if Iran is attacked, because they have more to lose,and they'd probably just do things like supply weapons etc...

Anyone, watching any of the GOP republican presidential debates, as you can see the media pathetic effort for pretending that Ron Paul doesn't exist.
DF-200-192451-579_6414.2
Ron Paul is right on every level but the mainstream media does not want him to get as much talk time as other Puppets such as Rick Santo rum and Mitt Romney

DF-200-192451-579_6417.4
The U.S. hasn't the capacity to commit to a full-scale war with Iran at present if one keeps in mind its quite significant pre-existing commitments, the state of the economy, and the strength of Iran's defensive capability - targeted strike(s) seems more likely, or perhaps greater action by Israel, but I doubt that.

This is backwards.
DF-200-192451-579_6673.5
It's not a threat, it's a response to the threats of others, e.g "Attack us and we'll close the Strait of Hormuz".
DF-200-192451-579_6673.6
There is nothing for other countries to respond to.

The Islamic Republic only exists in part because of Israel.
DF-200-192451-579_6673.14
Israel sold almost one billion $ of arms to the Islamic Republic during the Iran-Iraq war and provided loads of military aid (this was while Israel was apparently a supposed sworn enemy), training and even helpfully removed Iraq's nuclear capacity in Operation Opera; where if Saddam had developed nuclear weaponry he would have undoubtedly used against Iran.
DF-200-192451-579_6673.15
Did you know that there was a camp just outside Tehran of Israeli tacticians aiding Khomeini and co against Iraq for the whole of the conflict with Iraq?
DF-200-192451-579_6673.16
The Islamic Republic owes an awful lot to Israel - it enabled it to survive against Saddam and continue the war with Iraq (by continuing the war this enabled it to solidify it's position by killing thousands and thousands of Iranian democrats and other members of the opposition - as well as terrorising the population).
DF-200-192451-579_6673.17
Don't forget that Iran supported America when they invaded Afghanistan and Iraq as well.
DF-200-192451-579_6673.18
These are the facts:
DF-200-192451-579_6673.19
In the west, it is threatened by Iraq, in which US forces are still present
DF-200-192451-579_6673.20
In the east, Afghanistan has at least 100,000 US troops alone
DF-200-192451-579_6673.21
South-east, Pakistan which has nuclear arms, corrupt officials and is a US ally
DF-200-192451-579_6673.22
All around are arab countries with friendly ties to the US who keep rallying for the 'head to be cut off the snake'
DF-200-192451-579_6673.23
North-west, Turkey, Nato ally
DF-200-192451-579_6673.24
North-east contains refuelling stations for US millitary vehicles in Turkmenistan
DF-200-192451-579_6673.25
who is really being threatened here?
DF-200-192451-579_6673.26
Sorry to inform you: THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE WOULD GO TO WAR :P
DF-200-192451-579_6673.27
As nice as it would be for countries like the USA and the UK to be over there to help, the truth is we wouldn't interfere if it wasn't for the oil and other economic and political gains.
DF-200-192451-579_6673.28
If they do restrict the Straight it will will cause a massive decrease in the amount of oil to the west (40% of imported oil comes from the straight according to a figure I saw on the news), and our economy would greatly suffer...
DF-200-192451-579_6673.29
We would in that situation definitely cause a big commotion.
DF-200-192451-579_6673.30
I highly doubt there would be a WW3, but I do know for certain that the big countries and supper powers would go to war due to globalisation and economic links.
DF-200-192451-579_6673.31
In Australia the poor quality of local broadcaster's international news seems to have completely baffled the general population as to exactly what is going on, the coverage is utterly appealing to be honest and regularly confuses their nuclear programs and their attempts to blockade the Straits of Homuz.
DF-200-192451-579_6673.32
Politically the general gist of things is that the current Labor government is stuck between sucking up to the United States and therefore getting embroiled in any potential conflict (HMAS Parramatta is presently off Somalia under NATO command and could get drafted in should military action commence) and the fact that the Greens now have control over them through their control of the Senate and their single lower house seat (Hung Parliaments for you) and of course are very anti-war, anti-NATO and anti-ANZUS.
DF-200-192451-579_6673.33
The ultimate result will be down to who is Prime Minister when such a situation occurs, according to the unions they intend to fire Gillard next month and replace her with Kevin Rudd yet again who is extremely pro-China and less aligned with the United States although he will probably suck up to Obama as well.
DF-200-192451-579_6673.34
The opposition will attempt to counter any potential for entering the war with statements such as "They'll be Iranian Boatpeople" causing national panic and further hatred of innocent refugees potentially leading to an early election and a Coalition (Liberal-Nationals) government being formed who will support the war to a degree but otherwise will be to focused on Nauru which is the main aim of their entire foreign policy.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.1
Over these past two years, I have noticed an increasing amount of anti-Iranian news reports which have culminated in the recent attacks on the British Embassy with both countries expelling our respective Diplomats.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.2
It now seems certain to me that within the next decade the U.K and U.S.A among others will be involved in a fully fledged war against Iran.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.3
Throughout history, the expelling of Diplomats has usually meant one thing and when this is coupled with the Arab Spring alongside general unrest for a long period in Iran, it seems inevitable we are heading towards another war.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.4
As a general question, I would like to ask others to see what you think?
DF-200-192451-579_6674.5
Are we going to war, what can we do to avoid this and just in general for people to air their opinions on another war in the Middle East.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.6
P.S. Just to clarify I am neither anti nor pro war, this is just a launch pad for a discussion.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.7
Given the Israeli mentality I would say we will see them strike Iran.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.8
Would't be shocked if they used nukes either tbh
DF-200-192451-579_6674.9
That is a big claim,
DF-200-192451-579_6674.10
it would quite an amazing escalation if Israel used nuclear bombs on Iran.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.11
I know, however Israel is going to know that if they strike Iran Iran will hit back.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.12
Conventional weapons may not even be able to hit some of the fortified facilities either.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.13
The idea of a single debilitating strike on Iran that will stop it ever being able to strike back is going to be very very tempting for Israel.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.14
And depending on which way the American election goes American support may not be forthcoming if someone like Ron Paul gets elected
DF-200-192451-579_6674.15
If they have/get nukes, no one's invading Iran.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.16
I personally think it would be cool, Israel might have to think twice before carrying out major bombings in Palastine etc.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.17
There will always be that deterrant if Iran gets nukes.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.18
Of course not but the question is fast becoming not will Israel strike but when and how.
DF-200-192451-579_6674.19
A conventional strike on Iran is going to raise massive geopolitical consequences too. Including huge damage to the world economy and the possible destruction of Israel.

It is a shame that scandal has hit Herman Cain because he had promise.
DF-200-192451-579_6799.12
I am an Independent voter and my opinion is that who ever the Republican nominee is, they probably won't be willing to do what's necessary for the U.S. economy if elected.
DF-200-192451-579_6799.13
If Obama is reelected he definitely won't be willing to do what's necessary for the economy.
DF-200-192451-579_6799.14
I hope most other independents feel the same.

For example if my Grandfather was a British Citizen born in the U.K, who then moved and married a none British Citizen, and they then had my mother outside of the U.k, my mother would still be eligible for citizenship.
DF-200-192451-579_6832.19
However if my mother then married a non Brit and gave birth to me outside of U.K I would no longer be eligible for citizenship as Citizenship rights only extend one generation in the Uk.

It's not a bloody cod killstreak.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.10
Why when they kill civillians do they have the cheek, to quote the Times article to say 'they're has been no collateral damage in drone attacks' when according to the Times again there are pictures of incinerated young children?
DF-200-192451-579_6850.11
Now do you understand why many people, especially muslims have a gripe against the Americans?
DF-200-192451-579_6850.12
At least most muslims are sane, unlike the American goverment who just can't seem to stop committing terrorist acts.

what would the outcry be like..?
DF-200-192451-579_6850.18
OP I suggest that you watch the documentary ''Secret Pakistan'' on BBC iPlayer and then come back to argue.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.19
This supposed ally of the USA is training and preparing INNOCENT Afghan children who are too young to understand Islam properly to go into a busy Afghan bazaar to blow up INNOCENT Afghan civilians.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.20
This is what Pakistan deserves for funding lunatic Islamic rebels since the the 1960s against any Afghan government that has existed.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.21
It is the price paid for the two million dead Afghans during the Soviet occupation and the civil war which Porkistan funded.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.22
The truth is, every time these drones hit, they kill maybe 10% terrorists (at max) and 90% civilians.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.23
Each of this civilians is a real human with real emotion, not just a statistic.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.24
For instance, a 10 year old kid sees their father blown to pieces, you expect them to love the Americans?
DF-200-192451-579_6850.25
They become radicalised and ready to murder Americans at any cost.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.26
America strategically targets civilians so they have a reason to stay there due to further radicalisation of youth.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.27
I tried to watch the program "Secret Pakistan" but the question i kept asking was why?
DF-200-192451-579_6850.28
In the first ten - twenty minutes they never explained why Pakistan would want to double cross.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.29
Now don't get me wrong there will be people within the intellilgence who are double crossing and have a secret agenda.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.30
But to the highest level as a whole why would the government want such destabilisation from all angles.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.31
The president is corrupt and money hungry but i would say that there are plenty of easier ways for him to do that if he so pleases and putting the country into turmoil and him in a terrible light would surely be foolish.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.32
And re the whole drone thingn I really struggle to understand how they can be justified at all.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.33
When lots of people in USA died in 2001 they felt angry, agrieved and wwant revenge.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.34
To do this they went on a long war resulting in thousands of deaths and also did not take regard for countries' sovereignty.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.35
Now again a lot if not the majority of deaths are not caused by the USA directly but a significantly large number are therefore it is still a valid point to raise.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.36
I would love to know how a usa citizen would react if bombs were dropped on their home towns by a foreign country.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.37

DF-200-192451-579_6850.39
All these people saying ohh, you are creating the terrorism!
DF-200-192451-579_6850.40
Well, we wouldn't be doing anytyhing were it not for the terrorists in the first place.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.41
And what cause have they?
DF-200-192451-579_6850.42
They didn't like American foireign policy.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.43
So instead of going to a parliment meeting, they went to armory and decided to blow **** up and kill innocents.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.44
You want someone to blame for the deaths of civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, look no further than Muslim Terrorists.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.45
I think most people are looking at this, again, without an objective analysis of the situation.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.46
Ever since the intervention in Afghanistan and drone attacks of Pakistan, can anyone give me a successful attack by al-Qaeda on the West since the intervention?
DF-200-192451-579_6850.47
Some people should know better that the United States and her allies are not on some mission to kill innocent civilians, quite the contrary.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.48
Most of the contributions in this topic have failed to recognize that Islamic fundamentalists have been operating in Pakistan and are the root cause of terrorism in that area.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.49
In 2006, Pakistan saw 657 terrorist attacks leaving 907 people dead.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.50
In 2007, Pakistan saw 1,503 terrorist attacks, resulting in 3,448 casualties.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.51
In 2008, Pakistan saw 2,148 terrorists attacks, resulting in 2,267 casualties.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.52
In 2009, Pakistan saw 2,586 terrorist attacks, that resulted in 3,021 fatalities.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.53
Terrorist attacks have killed over 35,000 people.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.54
If we compare this to figure of civilian casualties (which I will go into) it is quite a healthy ratio as of the 1658 to 2597 killed, 385 were thought to be civilians, in contrast of the Taliban/al-Qaeda's operations to kill civilians.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.55
Interestingly, the number of terror attacks in Pakistan dropped which can prove to be conclusive evidence of the effect on al-Qaeda and Taliban leadership and their effective operational capability that is decreasing.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.56
One can logically say these drone attacks are working, which is reported on both sides if you look at the current fragmentation of al-Qaeda and asscoatied jihadist sects leadership operating on the Afghan-Pakistani border.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.57
From a strategy perspective, in 2009 and 2010, air drones were equipped with new missiles called Small Smart Weapon (SSW) or typically known as 'Scorpion.'
DF-200-192451-579_6850.58
These missiles have increased accuracy and expanded surveillance, including the use of small, unarmed surveillance drones to pinpoint the exact location of targets.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.59
Ever since the introduction of civilian causality countermeasure technology, Bloomberg reports that 1,300 militants were killed and only 30 civilians killed in drone attacks in mid-2008.
DF-200-192451-579_6850.60
The New America Foundation believes that civilian casaulties have decreased from 25% to an estimated 6%, with a total of 18 civilians killed since August 2010.

On the grounds of legality, according to the Geneva Convention, members of regular armed forces - involved in conflicts - are the only persons who may be considered lawful combatants and authorised to use lethal force.

Islamic fundamentalist groups total of 35,000 casualties (since 2003) or the United States' 385 casualties (since 2004)?

DF-200-192451-579_6850.73
Right, so to you there's no difference in blowing up 100's of civilians in a crowded market place, and blowing up a building but phoning the threat in beforehand to minimise civilian casualties? In that case, it's ok every, Bishy just basically said collaterol damage doesn't exist for any Western forces as there's no distinction between force used. Let's start bombing civilian areas, it just doesn't matter apparantly And of course, I don't condone either group, afterall, the IRA's aims were only achieved after they laid down their arms.

Why would governments and companies in certain countries sell arms to an offensive country when they attack a country they dislike but then attack that country when it attacks a country they do like
DF-200-192451-579_7557.2
this is double standards!
DF-200-192451-579_7557.3
I am talking about the Iraq before and during the Gulf War.
DF-200-192451-579_7557.4
Iraq attacked Iran then governments were happy to sell weapons to Iraq including UK, France, US, West Germany, Italy, China and Soviet Union.
DF-200-192451-579_7557.5
Some of them were even selling to both sides such as US, Soviet Union and China.
DF-200-192451-579_7557.6
A small minority sold only to Iran these were North Korea and surprizingly Israel according to Israel (although Iran denies this).
DF-200-192451-579_7557.7
Why would all these countries be happy for Iraq to go on the war path and to fund both all sides of the war yet go after Iraq when it starts on Kuwait (although they left Saddam in power).
DF-200-192451-579_7557.8
My thoughts are that governments simply let their private arms companies make a bit of cash off the war like they usually do.
DF-200-192451-579_7557.9
They used their puppet governments of the Shah and Saddam to control the countries to counter Soviet influence in the region.
DF-200-192451-579_7557.10
When the Islamic revolution happened the US lost all their influence over the nation so after Iraq began their attempted invasion they happily cast a blind eye in order to regain influence.
DF-200-192451-579_7557.11
Then when they saw Saddam invading country they already had influence in Kuwait they finally took action although they left him in power as the Soviets were still there and wouldn't want Iraq to become communist.
DF-200-192451-579_7557.12
Then 12 years later there is no longer a Soviet union but they notice a strengthening Iran that is a potential threat to their ally Israel so when some they get some 'evidence' of Iraq with nuclear material from a known unreliable source via MI6 they jump with joy to invade it.
DF-200-192451-579_7557.13
It is a win win for their publicity they either take out evil dictator Saddam or they stop Iraq getting nukes.
DF-200-192451-579_7557.14
Then they build up their bases in Iraq and fund a new government to counter the threat of Iran as they lost all influence upon Iraq when they stopped them in the first gulf war.
DF-200-192451-579_7557.15
These wars are just ways to prevent other nations gaining any sort of power whether it is directly or indirectly as well as make their arms companies some major money on the side.
DF-200-192451-579_7557.16
So if you still think the US and co are the just and honourable governments they claim to be why would they allow companies to fund two sides of a war?
DF-200-192451-579_7557.17
why would they go to war over an ideology?
DF-200-192451-579_7557.18
why would they only take action when a puppet state is invaded?
DF-200-192451-579_7557.19
Well, what are you proposing to replace it with?
DF-200-192451-579_7557.20
Because governments change every 4 years in most places and every government tends to pursue a different policy.

DF-200-192451-579_8014.9
As I understand it, the inhabitants of these islands feel a strong sense of Britishness, and want to continue to remain British.
DF-200-192451-579_8014.10
The islands belong to the islanders, not argentina, and if the islanders say they want to be argentinian, or independent, then the islands would cease to be british.

Or is there something I'm missing?
DF-200-192451-579_8164.8
even if the rate of economic growth almost doubles the rate of inflation, the effects of this high rate of inflation are still prominent; especially due to china's very unequal distribution of wealth.

"5.3% in cities and 6.0 in rural areas"
DF-200-192451-579_8164.10
The rural areas accomodate many of the peasants in china and as it faced such high rises in food prices and a 6% rise in general prices, those peasants are going to find it increasingly hard to purchase their commodities.

I am sure many of us are well aware of Samuel Huntington's "Clash of Civilizations" theory, that future conflict would be along cultural lines between "West", "East" and "Confucian" blocks, whatever they are.

It seems Australia is proposing a ban on the cultivation and possession of a range of plants that contain certain psychoactive substances.

- all plants in the Cannabis genus
DF-200-192451-579_8318.5
- all plants in the Erythroxylum genus (Which cocaine is derived from)

- Papaver somniferum and Papaver bracteatum (opium poppies)
DF-200-192451-579_8318.7
- all fungi that contain psilocin and psilocybin (magic mushrooms)

DF-200-192451-579_8318.14

- Any plant containing Mescaline
DF-200-192451-579_8318.16
- Any plant containing DMT (this is the one i find most absured as there are litterally 100s if not 1000s of plants and trees that contain this substance, many grow wild in Australia and are commonly used in landscaping.
DF-200-192451-579_8318.17

And before people shout oil at me.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.21
Well you are just going to have to wait until after this ends aren't you to see if it was.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.22
Frankly I cannot imagine why companies would negotiate oil contracts only to try to convince the government to invade the country so they lose them.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.23
Taking some of the responsibility for enforcing a no fly zone (i.e. patrolling shooting down any planes which Gadaffi uses to bomb civilians) would have been acceptable due to the UN resolution and the fact that civilians in Benghazi were sitting ducks.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.24
However, bombing ground troops in order to allow armed rebels to rampage further west is, in my opinion, completely against the spirit of the UN resolution.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.25
I increasingly get the impression that the coalition are not protecting civilians (i.e. unarmed citizens, not rebels) but rather are passively supporting the rebellion by decimating Gadaffi's soldiers who, at the end of the day, are just doing what they are told.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.26
It's easy to shout oil and the fact that it gets shouted so often means that it's also brushed off by those supporting military action, without a thorough evaluation.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.27
Oil is not the only reason why the coalition are backing the rebels (and I'm going to take the plunge now and say that they are), but it is certainly a consideration.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.28
Gadaffi has stated that (assuming he regains control over his country) he will only sell oil to the Russians and the Chinese.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.29
The rebels on the other hand have stated that they are willing to upgrade oil production in Benghazi three-fold.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.30
People can argue that we are doing our bit by helping out the Libyans in their time of crisis.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.31
But why haven't we intervened in the numerous conflicts in Africa over the past 20/30 years
DF-200-192451-579_8829.32
I agree that we should be helping out all these innocent people (im sure if it was the other way around we would want help from more powerful countries)
DF-200-192451-579_8829.33
But why there and not in other places?
DF-200-192451-579_8829.34
I do think our main reason for helping is oil and resources, which is pretty much as bad as doing nothing as we're not setting the example of helping people out in a time of crisis, its more of a " we'll help but only because we might get something in return"
DF-200-192451-579_8829.35
I know this is just how the world works, but there would be alot less trouble in the world if it wasnt.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.36
Anybody who believes the British Empire, once again, intervened in yet another country on 'humanitarian grounds' to protect 'innocent civilians' is absolutely ignorant of history and cannot use mere logic, or at least does not apply it to 'Queen and Country'.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.37
Or, they could be the opposite of independent thinkers and accept the propaganda spouted by the establishment.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.38
If the rebels were Communists, the intervention lead by the United States, Britain and France in Libya would not have occurred, nor would the rebel opposition be supported, had they been Communists.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.39
In other words, the intervention in Libya is not about protecting civilians, but instead entirely about protecting interests and siding with a candidate whom the 'coalition' prefers.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.40
If this was not the case, the United States would be intervening exactly how they are today in Libya, even if the rebels had been the Taliban.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.41
Furthermore, Britain and France have always stated from the very beginning that they were willing to intervene in Libya without the approval of the United Nations.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.42
Yet the justification they keep using for this intervention is to 'enforce humanitarian law authorised by the United Nations'.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.43
To be blunt while being honest...
DF-200-192451-579_8829.44
History will show once again, that the real reasons for this Capitalist-lead intervention in Libya was not about 'defending innocent people'.
DF-200-192451-579_8829.45
And when it does, all those who supported this intervention should be held accountable for their ignorance and the crime of strengthening a system which has consistently proven, through its billions of dead victims, to be the greatest monster this world has ever seen.

DF-200-192451-579_9042.14
And as far as an Islamic revolution is concerned i would say that it depends on how organized religious or clerical organizations are in a country and how politicized they are.
DF-200-192451-579_9042.15
Any analysis on the issue can't be a one size fits all jacket since the nature of the protests vary in all said countries.

I very much doubt Russia would be involved in this.
DF-200-192451-579_9454.10
China are sympathisers with the communist regime so possibly links there.
DF-200-192451-579_9454.11
There's very little anyone can do about it because bombing their nuclear facilities will result in Seoul being obliterated and most of South Korea being destroyed without nukes.

Hey guys, Reading the news daily,I can't help but notice that occasionally,the western media (CNN and sometimes BBC) pictures China as a country who is heartless,has no respect for human rights,dictatorship etc.etc.
DF-200-192451-579_9676.2
However,this past summer,i went to China for holiday,and it was nothing like the western media pictured it to be,the people all seem to enjoy life,no signs of human rights abuses (i traveled to Tibet to,the people seemed happy).
DF-200-192451-579_9676.3
I can't help but feel that the western media is portraying only one side of the story (Tibet),when in reality we Brits have also invaded Tibet and the world said nothing.
DF-200-192451-579_9676.4
I see that we are afraid of a communist country rising,and i know they aren't the nicest people,but neither were we when we colonized 1/4 of the world,or when the Americans drove the Indians off their land.

Are we right to be complaining about China when we don't have a clean record either?
DF-200-192451-579_9676.6
Do you think that the western media is demonizing China?

I'm half Chinese and the Western media is definitely demonizing China.
DF-200-192451-579_9676.9
The Chinese government has more support from its people than the British government does.
DF-200-192451-579_9676.10
When the West criticizes China about its lack of democracy of humans rights abuses it's usually only the West who has a problem with it and not the average Chinese person.
DF-200-192451-579_9676.11
And why are these clowns always complaining about Tibet?
DF-200-192451-579_9676.12
The fact that they don't care about Uyghurs just shows what hypocrites and bigots they are.
DF-200-192451-579_9676.13
That's because whenever a Chinese person does complain they get thrown in prison or shot.
DF-200-192451-579_9676.14

In the past nations would develop new technology to dominate its rivals, however with recent attempts to prevent Iran from developing Nuclear technology are we seeing powerful nations using economic terrorism (sanctions) and war to prevent other nations from developing technology to compete.
DF-200-192451-580_0112.3
For a nation with civilian and military nuclear technology to essentially deny another nation the same right to develop technology it is clear that the old guard of westenr powers are trying to prevent emerging powers from developing the same level of technology.

Sure we all want war to be just and we all think nothing like this should happen, but you'd be naive to think this is possible and this is how a war should be conducted.

It's a ******* war.

Apologies for being so inevitably stupid but...J Am I wrong in thinking superpowers are judged by their worth, their GDP?
DF-200-192451-580_0607.2
If so, how can China overtake the US even as it grows in this area?
DF-200-192451-580_0607.3
It is still way off the US GDP.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.4
I know the US have a lot of debt, and a great deal of it is owed to China
DF-200-192451-580_0607.5
Also, aren't Japan ahead of China in terms of GDP?
DF-200-192451-580_0607.6
when you have 1 billion+ people, its almost impossible not to become a super power...even if your army are fighting with swords and bows....cos it simply isn't possible to win against the sheer amount of numbers

I'm just trying to find out more about the subject really..
DF-200-192451-580_0607.10
IMO: growing military strength, economic potential and influence in international affairs make a superpower.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.11
its their industry, cheap labour, huge workforce, investment in technology and hard working nature.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.12
China is investing in the future, we here in Britain really are not...
DF-200-192451-580_0607.13
China is going for it headlong and because of this are developing more and more and discovering new things.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.14
China also has less strict laws on what not to do...i.e they will test and fund things that we have regulations against.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.15
They have huge industry which they dont care much in the way of climate problems.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.16
They have a massive population ready for any dirty job.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.17
Finally, they are a hard working people with dedication and less slobby
DF-200-192451-580_0607.18
Do we really want another superpower?
DF-200-192451-580_0607.19

The GDP is rapidly rising each year.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.21
LOL- Russia's economy is less than half the size of France and Germany's and almost half as small as the UK's.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.22
Coupled with the fact that the country has just been through a huge reccesion that has wiped off more than 10% of its GDP, and that it is falling to pieces through political instability, I think im right to say its a joke- not to mention the fact that its entire economy is based around exporting natural resources that will soon run out.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.23
It also worth mentioning that as soon as conventional oil reserves run out, the US and Canada will have by far the biggest reserves in the world in the form of Oil Shale etc.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.24
Did you just refer to information from Wikipedia in your argument?
DF-200-192451-580_0607.25

If they wanted to crap all over the $ they could do it on a whim - no other country on the planet has the ability to do so, let alone devalued their currency to such an extent it makes their exports look ridiculously cheap.

China in the global market.

It is a superpower without question.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.32
However to be a super-power you don't strictly have to be a developed economy.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.33
China is decades from being as developed as the US, regardless of the amount of money they have - Chinas greatest compromise is time.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.34
Major cities are much closer to their Western counterparts, however it is beyond where the issue lie in Chinas push as a credible economic entity.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.35

I got a few Chinese people telling me that China will be #1 in the future.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.38

Like some people said this in thread, US won't allow it.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.42
US wants to be the only example that represents democracy (Iraq being replaced with democratic system, etc).
DF-200-192451-580_0607.43
Because China is a communist country, it would be harder for them to influence other countries politically like how Great Britian influenced its idea to different regions of the world (US in language, Hong Kong in legal structure and language, etc).
DF-200-192451-580_0607.44
30-40 years is a very long time, I'm not denying that China has potential and could potentially become the most powerful country in the world.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.45
Notice the world could in bold, some people would argue that if it continues this growth it would become the world's most powerful country, both economically and militarily even I can see that, but the US will inevitably interfere, because it simply doesn't want competition, it wants to remain being the biggest, baddest dude on the block, and with China arriving on the world stage(i.e the new kid on the block) there'll inevitably and undoubtably be confrontations.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.46
I think China will become the world's second largest economy - perhaps even the largest, I think China will become very strong militarily - perhaps not as strong as the US as it is light years behind, but still strong, perhaps even stronger than all of Europe combined without the use of nukes.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.47
Do I think China will become a US type superpower?
DF-200-192451-580_0607.48
Meaning that its economy and military are both 10 times stronger than everyone elses - no I don't, as I've pointed out in my previous post, there'll China will inevitably want to become the regional power of Asia, it'll want to do some land-grabbing of its own(Taiwan for example) which will lead to its demise.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.49
Well I think Iran's only real crime has been defying US energy interests in the region.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.50
We saw what happened last time Iran defied the US in 1953 under Mossadegh,and the result was a CIA coup to put in someone who would happily bleed their country dry of their resources.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.51
The US have only themslefes to blame for the move to the theocratical tyranny we see now,and most people would agree Iran pose no global threat,but western propaganda representing Iran as some nuclear threat hasn't been based on IAEA reports or reason,but as the crescent of the 'axis of evil',that is those who dare to step out of line.

All roads are pointing towards an attack of some sort.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.53

Neither gained significant land, neither won any significant wars (indeed, the most famous war America was involved in post WWII was Vietnam, which they flunked) - hardly characteristics of a traditional superpower.

Superpowers tend to make huge strides in bettering the lives of human civilisation (the Romans did it by furthering democracy, the British Empire did it with the industrial revolution).

The US and SU certainly didn't make any groundbreaking revolutions.
DF-200-192451-580_0607.58

They had the potential military might to rival classic superpowers, but times have changed so much that it was just never going to happen.
DF-200-192451-580_1344.1
My professor raised this point this morning in class:
DF-200-192451-580_1344.2
" Hundreds and thousands of years ago, my family lived in Norway, in a consequent town where there were families like mine, making a little clan.
DF-200-192451-580_1344.3
We were then chased from Norway, because we were invaded by Norwegians saying that we were strangers, while it had been our land for centuries and centuries, and we couldn't be considered as strangers.
DF-200-192451-580_1344.4
Do you (asking the class) think that nowadays, I could go back to Norway, and chase the people living there, with the only argument that my family lived there for hundreds of year?
DF-200-192451-580_1344.5
Bearing this in mind, do you think that Israelians's motif for going back to their land is sufficient? "
DF-200-192451-580_1344.6
what do you think of it?
DF-200-192451-580_1344.7
Is he racist, or is he realistic?
DF-200-192451-580_1344.8
To be honest if Norway was the center of his religious beliefs and if he had been persecuted all the years after his family got kicked out he would have a different view.
DF-200-192451-580_1344.9
More importantly he is Christian - and he is ruled by Christian governments.
DF-200-192451-580_1344.10
Plus if you look at it from his point of view.
DF-200-192451-580_1344.11
Conquest determines land holding.
DF-200-192451-580_1344.12
His family was in Norway, they got conquered and so ceased to own the land.
DF-200-192451-580_1344.13
Well the Arabs that used to live in Israel got 'conquered' per se - although a much more benign version of conquest - and so no matter what the original motives for the conquest were, they lost the right to that land.
DF-200-192451-580_1344.14
He is neither racist nor realistic - just wrong.
DF-200-192451-580_1869.1

I'm using extremists lightly, I'm just using the word as something to categorize them.
DF-200-192451-580_1869.3
As in groups like BNP, Nazis and extremist Muslims or any partly aggressive religion, could they all be counted as bad as each other?
DF-200-192451-580_1869.4
They can all inspire hate, change stories and have radical/controversial views.

DF-200-192451-580_3051.2
So, as well as the presidential election yesterday, American voters could also vote on a lot of state-specific propositions, one of which was California's proposition 8.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.3
Gay marriage has been legal in California since May, but this proposition was in favour of eliminating the rights of gay couples to marry.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.4
It passed.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.5
I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this..
DF-200-192451-580_3051.6
I think its terrible.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.7
They shouldn't be allowed to do an about turn like that for no apparent reason, especially given the fact that it only recently became allowed.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.8
They could have at least given it a chance first.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.9
It's just even more of a shame that, at a time when America appears to be turning a new leaf, there's still so many people with this frame of mind.

It just really bugs me that it got turned round so soon as well..
DF-200-192451-580_3051.11
Gay couples should be allowed the happiness that marriage may bring, just like straight couples.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.12
They should have just kept it legal and let those who disagree have a grumble and grind their teeth over it all - it's not like they're suffering.

This suprised me to be honest, California has always been known as one of the more progressive states in the union.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.14

DF-200-192451-580_3051.15
California has a huge Roman Catholic population which obviously rejects it, not helped by the large influx of migrant S-American Catholics into the state.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.16
Okay yes, true, they were allowed.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.17
Which did mean people had the right to do them.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.18
But I think the issue of the right to marry is different because people worked to get the right and to change the law for it to be allowed.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.19
It wasn't just a right because no one had told them they couldn't do it, like your examples.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.20
I think the issue here is not whether marriage is a right, but whether everyone should be considered equal.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.21
Either everyone has the right to marry, or no one does.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.22
Just as nobody has the 'right' to murder (which quite frankly I find to be a weak argument due to reasons already mentioned), either nobody should have the right to marry, or everybody should.

That's all there is to it.

I would argue that any law that I judge to be unjust is inherently illegitimate and thus I have no moral obligation to follow it or consider it to be a moral principle, nor would I use it to guide my decision making in any more than potentially in a practical sense.

I certainly could not and will not respect the rule of law when it imposes restrictions on two consenting adults expressing their love, and quite frankly I think that such unjust laws undermine the whole system.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.26

It forced schools to teach same-sex marriage as a morally EQUAL alternative, Cal like the rest of America is full of religious people and they do not see this as right.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.30
It will only take away the right for same-sex couples to call it marriage, everything else is still there.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.31
Well, you're sort of right; we're all being treated as second class citizens, but you sort of missed the point.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.32
Rights have been taken away in both instances.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.33
The moral outrage (here, anyway) associated with one has not been associated with the other simply because one is acceptable and one isn't; so it's not the fact that a right has been taken away is wrong, its that you think X should have a right and that right has been taken away so you're annoyed.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.34
Incidentally; if you're white, female, black, communist, jewish, whatever; you can still not get married if you're gay.
DF-200-192451-580_3051.35
If marriage is defined as a man and a woman then banning gay marriage is perfectly legitimate.

I was reading an article about how we need more black sold models for young black people to aspire to.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.2
Because apparently, all young blacks in Britain need an extra reminder not to commit crimes and be involved in gangs.

This highlights a severely racist phenomenon that is considered completely acceptable.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.4
That all these initiatives are exclusively targeting young black British people ( in attempt to curb the apparent swarms of exclusively black teenagers begging to be part of a gang) while completely ignoring any other skin colour.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.5
Now obviously not every black male wants to go committing crimes all day, and the evidence suggests that blacks like committing crimes just as little as other skin colours do.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.6
So why the disproportionate representation in the media and in crime prevention strategies?
DF-200-192453-580_3219.7
Why does nobody care about crime in the east European, the Asian or (god forbid) the white community?
DF-200-192453-580_3219.8
Why is nobody saying how great a role model plan B is for all the young white kids growing up in council estates.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.9
You can go anywhere in Britain and see that gang culture and criminals exist everywhere, in every ethnic group.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.10
Logic would dictate that a white oriented initiative would make the most sense for demographic reasons.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.11
Or how about something which does not base its case on skin colour and ethnic origin?
DF-200-192453-580_3219.12
Do people really think that a poor white teenager doesn't need support, encouragement or aspiration?
DF-200-192453-580_3219.13
I completely agree with everything you've said.

I also think it's this ridiculous idea that crime in certain ethnic groups needs to be dealt with more urgently that causes more problems.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.15
If the ethnicity and colour of those committing crimes wasn't mentioned, it would be much less big a deal. Why this country feel the need to consistently talk about the colour of people is beyond me.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.16
It's like when we beg for Asian/black police officers.

I believe it's things like this that make white people believe the country are going against them.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.20
If the government didn't deal with things only to do with race, then I, perhaps naively and idealistically, believe that it would become less of a big deal.

In London, blacks commit a disproportionate amount of crimes.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.22
Hence, why they're targeted.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.23
Most gangs in London are full of blacks.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.24
Black role models give black people hope.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.25
It's not about whether it should or why does it, it just does because black community are a semi-community.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.28
Totally agree.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.29
Poor white people (pre 20th century, just poor people) have been discriminated against for hundreds of years in Britain.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.30
Immigration happens and we're suddenly part of the oppressing class?
DF-200-192453-580_3219.31
Growing up poor and white in a mostly non white school was horrible.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.32
Having to learn about the evilness of white people repeatedly really doesn't give white kids the impression that they have a place in our multicultural society.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.33
The reason specific ethnic groups are targeted for trying to reduce crime is because, for whatever reason, crime overall is often higher statistically in these groups.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.34
This is not because their race or culture is wrong or bad in any way, it's simply a fact that certain groups have higher rates of crime.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.35
Whether it's the result of poverty or cultural differences and stresses in Britain that are leaving them vulnerable to getting lured into crime, pretending that a group that has more prevalence for crime hasn't is just foolish.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.36
I don't know the statistics, but if black youths are the target of an anti-crime and role-model drive, then it's probably because they have a higher crime rate than other groups, and because the government wants to make sure that whatever factor it is (because we know it's not their race itself) is addressed so they can have a better future.
DF-200-192453-580_3219.37
And there are schemes targeting white populations, but when there is an imbalance between ethnic groups, it surely has to be a priority to address what is causing this imbalance - if for nothing else then for the sake of equality!
DF-200-192453-580_3379.1
There's a lot of talk recently about how diversity is necessary, but how far do we go?
DF-200-192453-580_3379.2
And how do we judge what is a good and strong/positive multiracial country?
DF-200-192453-580_3379.3
When you look at other western countries like Canada, America, Australia, the vast majority of its immigrants are not white these days and are probably heading for a more diverse future, so much so to the point that these nations will have very different demographic look to them in 50 years time.
DF-200-192453-580_3379.4
They will have great bragging rights you could say when it comes to multiracialism and diversity than Britain or most european countries will maybe not have.
DF-200-192453-580_3379.5
You often here quotes like "Hollywood is too white" "the tories are too white" but what defines what is "too white"?
DF-200-192453-580_3379.6
So I'm wondering if people could put Britain in the same context?
DF-200-192453-580_3379.7
Like I say people brand multiracialism as a good thing, very few want to go back to a 100% white society but how multiracial do we need to go to satisfy the vast majority of people, particularly liberals?
DF-200-192453-580_3379.8
I personally think it's completely necessary but I know many of my opponents will disagree.
DF-200-192453-580_3379.9
Are we still not multiracial enough compared to some of our western rivals??

DF-200-192453-580_3379.11
Mate you are all confused.
DF-200-192453-580_3379.12
When people say "the tories are too white" or "hollywood is too white"
DF-200-192453-580_3379.13
what they MEAN is "The amount of white people in the tories are disproportionately represented compared to the british population".
DF-200-192453-580_3379.14
I.e. 14% of the british population is non-white, but 14% of the tories are not correspondingly non-white.
DF-200-192453-580_3379.15
There is a bias in representation.
DF-200-192453-580_3379.16
This is bad because it means certain races are being excluded.
DF-200-192453-580_3379.17
This is COMPLETELY different to asking whether an entire nations population should be a certain skin colour - skin colour should be irrelevant.
DF-200-192453-580_3379.18
It's absolutely sickening you would want to diminish a race's presence just for the sake of it.
DF-200-192453-580_3379.19
The question is pretty, well, questionable
DF-200-192453-580_3379.20
I don't know of many people who want diversity FOR DIVERSITY'S SAKE.
DF-200-192453-580_3379.21
The issue with places like "white" hollywood is the glass ceiling that keeps minorities AND women out, as there is the feeling (whether true or not!) that there is not a level and fair playing field.
DF-200-192453-580_3379.22
Funny how people come up with imaginary arguments from the "other side", as I've never HEARD any of these "liberals" you refer to.

If a memeber of your family was going an illegal activty would you conact the police about their actions?

DF-200-192453-580_4331.5
I think I would personally confront that family memeber.
DF-200-192453-580_4331.6
If i am unsuccessful i'd get other family members to help and ultimately if they still refuse to listen -- i'd leave them to their own accord and let them do what they belive is right or wrong.
DF-200-192453-580_4331.7
Because at the end of the day, my conscious would be clear [in the sense that i did try and help them].
DF-200-192453-580_4331.8
Telling the police would not be wise, as you'd be creating enemies.
DF-200-192453-580_4331.9
It'd depend what they were doing.
DF-200-192453-580_4331.10
If I didn't think they were harming anyone (smoking dope, illegally downloading music etc) then I wouldn't report them; if they were hurting other people (violent crime, theft from individuals etc) then I definitely would.

Same goes for anyone I was aware of committing a crime, tbh.

I'm not against immigration but i think it should be more regulated.
DF-200-192453-580_4408.5
Why? Because immigration has already caused a lot of "social issues" and until we solve those problems I don't think its good to just let everyone in.
DF-200-192453-580_4408.6
How should it work: education of english, their intentions, and to what they will contribute and most importantly their ideologies and beliefs.
DF-200-192453-580_4408.7
To those whom the welfare state is the biggest concern I think the problem arises from the fact that there are already too many english people sponging off the state and if we add anymore people be it immigrants or "britons" our state of government would collapse and then our economy.

Because I wish to protect diversity.

So that means that in contrast to the general population they are actually slightly under represented therefore the NHS does not rely on immigrants as much as leftie TSR users claim they do.

well certainly in london they are here.

All i see on TheStudentRoom these days is agitated non-muslims interrogating muslims, criticising their religion (as any sane person would), muslims signing up to the student room JUST to post some anti-israel propaganda to persuade people about how evil israel is or how islam is the religion of peace
DF-200-192453-580_4472.2
it seems that the blood libel rumour of medeival times that Jews kill christian babies to use their blood for wine is today in the form of zionists/jews/israelis killing palestinian babies just because theyre pure evil, and i think the islamic propaganda machine is succeeding in convincing people?

From TSR to a National Scale is a pretty big jump don't you think.

Over the past 1-2 years I've had quite a few discussions with people about current affairs (namely the issue of terrorism and the related issues of immigration, global politics etc) and quite often heard a common belief that a british civil war will erupt when ethnic minorities increase in numbers and become more estabished.
DF-200-192453-580_4538.2
This beleif is common amonst certain white british nationalists etc...
DF-200-192453-580_4538.3
I don't believe this will ever happen for various reasons....
DF-200-192453-580_4538.4

DF-200-192453-580_4538.5
If so, what do you predict/envisage?
DF-200-192453-580_4538.6
I believe it will happen (something similar to what India has now to an Israel-Palestine type thing).
DF-200-192453-580_4538.7
What a ridiculous comparison.
DF-200-192453-580_4538.8
How is it any different?
DF-200-192453-580_4538.9
The only difference is Palestine are still suffering injustice.
DF-200-192453-580_4538.10
As the numbers of minority groups who don't respect secular law increase they will demand greater autonomy, and mini-vassal states will appear but still remain part of the UK (like Palestine) and things will get pretty tense.
DF-200-192453-580_4538.11
So you reckon that first a large imperial power will rule the UK (like the Ottomans ruled Palestine).
DF-200-192453-580_4538.12
This imperial power will be defeated and then power will pass to another power (like Palestine became a British mandate).
DF-200-192453-580_4538.13
So you think that an entire group of people are going to move to the UK after a genocide, and then a state will be established, voted for and partitioned by the United Nations?
DF-200-192453-580_4538.14
You then think that neighbouring countries will then invade this new state, that the native British people will be forced to flee to like Cornwall (Gaza) and Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and a part of East London (West Bank).
DF-200-192453-580_4538.15
That these British people will form militant groups, that want to return to the former England.

I keep frequently seeing threads made hating on Islam, which is somewhat hypocritical and disturbing I believe in many cases.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.2
I am an Atheist; therefore I am not trying to defend Islam out of being 'Islamic' before I am accused of that.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.3
I am also considered by British nationalists to be 100% British (Although I reject the idea that it makes a real difference), so I am not showing sympathy for Islam out of experiencing similar hostility or racism.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.4
However, I do believe that Islam and Christianity, along with other major religions, all play very similar and negative roles in the world.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.5
Therefore, I do not believe we should be cherry-picking Islam as some specific evil, but rather opposing all religions for the extremely negative roles they play in the world.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.6
The usual argument held against Islam is that it is responsible for terrorism.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.7
This may be correct, but the fact of the matter is; whether somebody is using Islam to commit terrible acts, regardless of the wrongdoing, all major religion play a large role in shaping societies, and ultimately, fulfil playing a very similar negative role.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.8
And when using the idea that Islam ‘inspires terrorism’, if we were honestly that bothered about such wrong-doing in the world, then we would surely be more concerned with ending the much more severe crisis's and wrong-doing's such as starvation and war.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.9
Both of these ills are far more widespread and important than the threat of terrorism, as of which we are more liking to die by our own hands rather than by the hand of an 'Islamic terrorist'.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.10
It is almost unbelievable how the idea that a Christian should have any sympathy or support when they proclaim a dislike for Islam, when the religion they subscribe to right now in Britain, is playing a much more negative role.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.11
We should oppose religion simply on the basis that all religion plays a negative role.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.12
But we should not bully specific religions because of certain conditions and influences of the societies we presently live in.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.13
This is of course, an argument only for those who aspire to reason, rationality and evidence in mind.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.14
I have no expectation that I will be receive any support for my remarks by Christians or other adherents of major religions.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.15
I am an atheist and I think Islam is the most inherently evil religion out of all the other ones.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.16
I would choose to live in a christian society over a Muslim one any day.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.17
As an atheist I can differentiate between Islam and Christianity, in that Christianity is progressive, whilst Islam is not.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.18
Well to be honest it's a two headed coin.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.19
I completely agree sometimes, there is a horrendously bad labeling of Islam unnecessarily.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.20
But sometimes it does no come under as much criticism (for small cases, not the religions as a whole) as other religions because people just get labelled racist.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.21
I know everybody is gonna neg me as racist but someone has to say it.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.22
Similarly to how not all claims are created equal, and individual claims require differing levels of evidence, neither are all religions created equal and it is rational to dislike a certain religion over another if one can be shown to be more detrimental to another.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.23
So it is irrelevant that you believe all religion plays a negative role, even though I agree with you, because our priorities should be focused on those which are the most detrimental.
DF-200-192453-580_5784.24
Would you honestly have us use the same resources in combating the negative effects of Islam and combating the negative effects of Jainism?

If you compare a traditionally Christian/Buddhist/whatever country to a traditionally Islamic country in terms of stability, equality, safety and crime, quality of life etc, there's a good chance the non-Islamic one is going to come out on top (there would likely be exceptions, but as a general rule.)

We live in an age where celebrities are gods and fame is sought after above all else.
DF-200-192453-580_6516.2

DF-200-192453-580_6516.3
Why do we feel the need to elevate people to celebrity status and worship them? I really don't understand how this culture emerged and why.
DF-200-192453-580_6516.4
Must have something to do with providing people with gods to worship and adore in an age in which gods have been killed. By doing so, I guess, many people are saved from nihilism as a result of the loss of values from the death of God. Thus, superstars and rockstars are put on a pedastal for people to look up to and aspire to be like. If we were living in ancient Rome, for example, the superstars and rockstars would be the heroic gladiators, but the best gladiators were often thought of as gods in their own right. They were supposedly treated like gods. Ceasar himself was worshipped as a god by the people. The gods of yestreday are the stars of today. When charles Atlas became famous they were saying he was a god. Great individuals are sometimes regarded as more than human by their fans. Fred Astair, Al Jolson, Charlie Chaplin, James Dean, Marlon Brando, Elvis, Sinatra, Bruce Lee, Bowie, Morrissey, boy bands like Take That, Lady Gaga and the like.

I can't recall hearing of this much before the riots of late, so I wonder whether it will become a regular crime from now on.
DF-200-192453-580_6584.2
It doesn't have to occur alongside a riot, but carefully planned and limited to a close circle, it could be a very lucractive crime.
DF-200-192453-580_6584.3
If a circle of 10-15 target a high-end retailer during a perfectly normal shopping day, perhaps at a strategic location and time, I don't really see what could stop them from looting a shop with lots of valuable merchandise within proximity of the entrance e.g. luxury clothes shop.
DF-200-192453-580_6584.4
if we made that number 100/200 it would be nearly impossible to stop them.
DF-200-192453-580_6584.5
Are you trying to set something up or what?
DF-200-192453-580_6584.6
That's different though, the riots were promoted like a chain letter, weren't they, rather than a plot between a few people who all actually knew each other, and therefore could be rounded up fairly easily.
DF-200-192453-580_6584.7
And surely it's just "looting" because it was still associated with general civil unrest.

Id like to make this clear, its not the muslims were having a go at, but the officials.

DF-200-192453-580_6754.8
Why did the officials ssay that?
DF-200-192453-580_6754.9
I think its because this country is afraid of muslims - suicide bombers, poppy burners, stoning people to death.... you know the story.
DF-200-192453-580_6754.10

In the 2001 census, the question of what people's religious affiliations were, and many people decided to put "Jedi" in the hope that it would be recognised as an official religion.
DF-200-192455-620_2658.3
It wasn't. But 390,000 people decided tocall themselves Jedis anyway.
DF-200-192455-620_2658.4
I'm wondering what people make of this.
DF-200-192455-620_2658.5
I kinda expected more Jedis to be out there, although in all honesty, I would say that I haven't actually seen anyone wielding a lightsaber, so that may be flawed.
DF-200-192455-620_2658.6
I just thought that seven in every thousand people is a bit small, since the campaign was well-publicised, and there were no repurcussions for not telling the truth on the religion question.
DF-200-192455-620_2658.7
So what does everyone else make of it?
DF-200-192455-620_2658.8
I know quite a few Jews put down ''Jedi'' on the census as they didn't want government records that they were Jewish - that's how Hitler managed to find all the Jews so easily - it was all kept carefully on detailed and accurate notes.
DF-200-192455-620_2658.9
It can be argued that it is none of the government's concern as to where each Jew/Muslim/Sikh/Christian etc. lives..
DF-200-192455-620_2658.10
how would that affect GDP or the state of the economy?
DF-200-192455-620_2658.11
On the other hand it can be said that they should know who practices what as they run the country and can thus make laws according the proportionate numbers of each faith etc.

- As a Jew and having experienced anti-Semtism myself (as many Jews have and do) I would sway towards the former view in terms of safety, but I can understand why people would disagree with this and choose the latter.

DF-201-185510-35_1190.2
anyone seen a real life sasquatch?
DF-201-185510-35_1190.3
I've seen an actual photograph of an actual person in an actual Bigfoot costume.
DF-201-185510-35_1190.4
Does that count?
DF-201-185510-35_1190.5
For any who weren't already aware Huntster believes he came upon a sasquatch trackway and I while camping with friends on Vancouver Island several years ago found two sets of tracks and had a close range audio encounter with what at the time I attributed to sasquatch(es- at the time I thought there was an adult and juvenile) but now I discount the event as inconclusive and likely mistaken identity given the spurious nature of BF evidence.
DF-201-185510-35_1190.6
However, I still fel pretty confident I could rule out hoaxing because of the remoteness of the area.
DF-201-185510-35_1190.7
But hey, you never know...
DF-201-185510-35_1260.1
I actually surfed in after a year because I wanted to hear the JREF side on this issue. No one appears to have posted about this yet.
DF-201-185510-35_1260.2
Apparently, the two folks that died paid nearly 10,000 dollars to attend the new age sweat led by two time Oprah guest.
DF-201-185510-35_1260.3
James Arthur Ray - a non-Native American, lead over 60 people into the sweat 'lodge'.
DF-201-185510-35_1260.4
20 people became ill, and one more is still in critical condition tonight.
DF-201-185510-35_1260.5
I just read about this story.
DF-201-185510-35_1260.6
It's a tragedy, and I also find it revealing that the New Age guru in question, Mr. Ray, has since left the state of Arizona.
DF-201-185510-35_1260.7
From what I understand, it sounds like Ray didn't know what the hell he was doing, because he put entirely too many people in entirely too small a space.
DF-201-185510-35_1260.8
In addition, they covered the lodge with materials that didn't allow for decent air flow.
DF-201-185510-35_1260.9
Put all of that together, and you have a situation ripe for asphyxiation.
DF-201-185510-35_1260.10
Apparently they are still wanting to question the guy.
DF-201-185510-35_1260.11
They said he was uncooperative.
DF-201-185510-35_1260.12
I don't know much about the laws on this but wouldn't it be negligent homicide or something?
DF-201-185510-35_1260.13
This would be an interesting story to keep up with.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.1
I have been searching for this story to no avail.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.2
A few weeks ago me and a few friends watched a TV show on Discovery (their house not mine!) where a guy claims to have recovered from a coma with a newfound ability...
DF-201-185510-35_1372.3
he can play the piano like an expert.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.4
He says he can't write music, but he sees musical notes in his mind and he can "miraculously" play them seemingly perfect, or close to it.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.5
He claims to have no musical training and has never played an instrument in his life.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.6
My B.S. meter went off, of course.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.7
Does anyone here have more information about this guy?
DF-201-185510-35_1372.8
I can't remember his name...I think he is in the U.S.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.9
I can't find anything on the web or here at JREF.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.10
For musicians: I wonder how he would handle key signatures since he says the notes just fly by in his mind.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.11
Are they notated as sharp or flat?
DF-201-185510-35_1372.12
Or is he stuck in C major forever?
DF-201-185510-35_1372.13
My off the cuff guess is that he played the piano before the coma.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.14
Perhaps he is a failed musician and saw an opportunity to get into the limelight.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.15
I would think people in his life would know that he could play previously, but as we all know, believers won't care, or simply claim that these people are lying.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.16
The ability to play the Piano and other instruments to a high level not only involves technical ability but also physical training ( remember the first time you tried to span notes on a Guitar or piano?)
DF-201-185510-35_1372.17
How is it possible he woke with all his Piano playing muscles fully developed?
DF-201-185510-35_1372.18
Well in the case of the guy Sacks writes about, it was more a matter of waking up to a newfound passion for the piano, not that he woke a fully developed piano player.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.19
He claims to have been a guy who listened to rock music before the accident, but afterward couldn't get enough of piano music, started to sit down at a piano to play, and then more and more often, and then he was hearing music in his head, and it just became an obsession.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.20
So nothing really mystical about it. The man himself seems to put a spiritual spin on it, but it makes sense all the same without it.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.21
I'd say it's not impossible.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.22
He seems to be playing by ear.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.23
His music is unstructured; it sounds like he's just playing whatever comes into his head.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.24
He's not playing classical works like Mozart.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.25
Also, I'd say he's self-taught at the very least.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.26
Watch his hands.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.27
He doesn't hold them in the typical positions that most piano players are taught.
DF-201-185510-35_1372.28
He looks like he's just stabbing at the next note he wants to play.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.1
It has been noted that there have been a lot of threads created on the topic of global warming.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.2
A great number of these topics rapidly descend into bickering and other rule violations.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.3
Although one of the biggest threads was put on moderated status, it seems that many of the other threads have sprung up in order to avoid moderated status.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.4
That thread has now been closed.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.5
Since many of the threads cover the same or similar ground, we've decided to keep only this thread for general Global Warming discussions, which will be moderated.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.6
Unless the topic is very different from the "general" discussion, new threads and posts about global warming will be moved to that thread if they satisfy the membership agreement.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.7
Failure to confine general discussions to this moderated thread or starting other threads for general discussion will be treated as Rule 6 violations and subject to a series of escalating penalties just like any other membership violation.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.8
We hope this will encourage civility in the discussion of global warming.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.9
We realize this topic inspires strong emotion, but please contain your emotion to those forms which are permissible under the Membership Agreement.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.10
I don't know if you guys have followed potholer54's channel on youtube, but his series of delightfully devastating and withering videos on climate science and creationism are something to behold.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.11
The latest in the series looks at the "scientists" that represent the denialist side in the climate "debate"
DF-201-185511-35_0532.12
I'm aware of realclimate.org, have read a few articles and what not over the last few months.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.13
The response was of course tongue and cheek, a commentary on the nonsense that you can't have a meaningful discussion without hot links.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.14
Hoepfully this new thread will promote just such discussions.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.15
I don't see how, short of turning to nuclear entirely, how we can reduce CO2 levels without sequestering and GE.
DF-201-185511-35_0532.16
Not only that, but if you believe the current models to be accurate, we need to reduce the effects of CO2 now.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.1
So this could have been in the science, music, or current events forum and if any mods should choose to move it, that will be fine with me.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.2
I'm watching the Grammys and they've put on a tribute to Glenn Campbell including Campbell singing Rhinestone Cowboy.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.3
And in the tribute they announce he has Alzheimer's.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.4
It amazes me that people are being diagnosed when they still have enough thought capacity to discuss their fate.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.5
Being rich, I hope he gets to try the new treatment recently successfully used on mice.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.6
I would.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.7
It's a drug currently approved for chemotherapy in humans.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.8
This will be remarkable if it pans out.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.9
So why did I post this and make it about Glenn Campbell instead of just about the science?
DF-201-185511-38_8794.10
I don't know.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.11
It just struck me hearing the announcement Campbell had Alzheimer's at the same time he was still well enough to appear on stage at the Grammy's.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.12
It's weird.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.13
And the discovery of a treatment that is a drug already approved for use in humans should make a bit different of a pathway for research.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.14
If you were wealthy or simply had access to the drug, and had Alzheimer's would you use it immediately instead of waiting for conclusive studies?
DF-201-185511-38_8794.15
I had this discussion with Linda (fls) in the past and I really wish she hadn't left the forum because i'd like to use this example to revisit the discussion.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.16
I can't speak for her but I got the impression she would wait for the research to be more conclusive.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.17
I use the criteria: if it is not harmful and there is some evidence it might work, and if there is no better alternative, I think it is worth trying.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.18
In this case it is the potential benefit and lack of any alternative treatment and the fact Alzheimer's is such a devastating terminal disease that it outweighs the fact the research is premature.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.19
What say the rest of you?
DF-201-185511-38_8794.20
I'd do it in a heartbeat.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.21
Our brain is who we are, and without memories we are just animals.

My feeling is that when I grow old enough that I've "had a good run," why not donate my body to science before I die?
DF-201-185511-38_8794.24
If I have some disease that will kill me in a few months or years anyway, then, by all means, experiment on me with some new drug that has potential.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.25
And if I have some issue that won't kill me for awhile, well, what the hell if the new drug causes some side effects?
DF-201-185511-38_8794.26
I can always stop taking it.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.27
Either way, there is some chance that I'll help people younger than I am.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.28
And once I die, then take my body and do whatever is useful with it.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.29
I don't need it anymore.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.30
I am my mind.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.31
At age 72, with the possibility of Alzheimer's looming in my future, I would take any supplement or drug -- experimental or otherwise -- that may prevent or delay this dreaded condition.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.32
Obviously I would avoid anything demonstrably and seriously harmful.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.33
Many conjectures like NSAIDs, simvastatin, fish oil have come and gone.
DF-201-185511-38_8794.34
I have and will continue to try them all until they are proven ineffective or seriously harmful.
DF-201-185511-38_8904.1
Precious little news on developments.

A bit of an anticlimax considering the conversation we had on the subject last year,

Much more gripping than this thread mate!
DF-201-185511-38_8904.9
The huge interconnected lakes about two miles below antarctic ice can't be touched because they must be under enormous pressure.
DF-201-185511-38_8904.10
I would think that to drill into them would cause a collapse of hundreds of miles of ice, erupting water, flooding and wiping out area the size of Victoria ?
DF-201-185511-38_8904.11
As is usual at JREF, much hilarity and education then ensued...
DF-201-185511-38_8914.1
Anxiety and inattention over Tokyo's next Big One
DF-201-185511-38_8914.2
It points out that a magnitude 7 earthquake is actually 1000 times smaller in terms of energy released that the magnitude 9.0 earthquake that caused the tsunami last year.
DF-201-185511-38_8914.3
However, the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 which killed over 100,000 was a 7.9.
DF-201-185511-38_8914.4
And, I'm pretty sure they don't mean that this earthquake will be exactly magnitude 7.
DF-201-185511-38_8914.5
It could be bigger.
DF-201-185511-38_8914.6
Still, I think that Tokyo is more earthquake-resistant today than it was in 1923.
DF-201-185511-38_8914.7
So, I guess I'll take my chances.
DF-201-185511-38_8914.8
Take your chances?!
DF-201-185511-38_8914.9
What do you live in Tokyo?
DF-201-185511-38_8914.10
Curious...do other Earthquake agencies agree with the data from Tokyo?
DF-201-185511-38_8914.11
I would like to know what scale they're using, because different seismic scales can result in enormously different results.
DF-201-185511-38_8914.12
A perfect example is the two largest Christchurch earthquakes.
DF-201-185511-38_8914.13
The first was M7+ but did only minor damage and caused no fatalities due to a low Mercalli Intensity reading (actual measure of intensity of shaking in a particular place).
DF-201-185511-38_8914.14
The second M6.3 quake registered at X (Intense) and higher on the Mercalli Intensity scale and had the highest peak ground acceleration ever recorded.
DF-201-185511-38_8914.15
Many seismologists have said that the quake would have completely flattened almost any city in the world.
DF-201-185511-38_8914.16
In terms of energy released, the deadly Christchurch quake was not particularly big, but in terms of shaking intensity it was one of the most destructive quakes ever recorded.
DF-201-185511-38_8914.17
Japan's "Shindo" scale is like the Mercalli Intensity Scale, but doesn't have anywhere near as many divisions.
DF-201-185511-38_8914.18
The highest category is 7 which seems to equate with VIII on the Mercalli scale (it goes up to XII).
DF-201-185511-38_8914.19
This basically means a Scale 7 quake could be anything from a decently sized but not overly destructive quake right up to a city-leveling event.
DF-201-185516-35_3189.1

There's no reason to believe that we could get the US, Mexico and Canada to ever agree on a common currency.
DF-201-185516-35_3189.5
Plus, the Euro zone is showing strains around the edges, so now would be a very bad time to try.

So why do you guys think the US invaded Iraq and Afghanistan?
DF-201-185516-35_4986.2

America had been toying with the idea of "revisiting" Iraq ever since the first war ended, particularly in 1998, when Saddam first started getting coy with the inspectors.
DF-201-185516-35_4986.13
It didn't get much traction then because America was, at the time, experiencing a resurgance of isolation after the end of the Cold War.
DF-201-185516-35_4986.14
The issues were the same then, but Bush found the post-9/11 America a bit more ameniable to the idea of war.
DF-201-185516-35_4986.15
Oil, WMDs, Al Queda, these were all simply McGuffins.
DF-201-185516-35_4986.16
The real reason is that Saddam was a petty dictator who weilded an inordinate amount of influence and was continually giving the impression that he was Up To Something.

Whether he actually was or not wasn't the point.

DF-201-185521-44_0947.7
Given that news papers often print opinion pieces to raise interest in their title it seems that it is far from being a pretty stupid thing to print as we are talking about the newspaper...

I'm sure that was a complete accident of course.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.1
I hear all sorts of perspectives on marriage. Those who think monogamy is the proper standard, those who think monogamy is a tool used to oppress women, those who think that polygamy is terrible, those who think that polygamy is natural, etc.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.2
But virtually ever culture in the world has some form of marriage...a concept in which a life-long union is idealized, where there are formal ceremonies to 'sanctify' a man and a woman (or multiples thereof). Cultures where, from childhood, children are raised and taught these ideals to the point where most of us think it is a natural part of human nature.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.3
The FORM of marriage may differ from culture to culture, but it is consistent throughout our cultures.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.4
That is, except for at least one very unique culture, the Mosuo, a Chinese minority group who live in the Himalayan mountains, close to the border with Tibet.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.5
Two years ago, I established a non-profit organization to work with the Mosuo, focusing on a variety of aspects (education, development, etc.), but also on promoting awareness of their culture, and to trying to preserve it.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.6
In the Mosuo culture, there is no marriage.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.7
No marriage ceremonies exist.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.8
There is no expectation whatsoever of life-time bonds or pairings.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.9
Children are raised not only without an expectation of spending their life with that one special person, but they often don't even know (or care) who their biological father is.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.10
In the Mosuo culture, men and women can change and choose partners as they please.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.11
Monogamy is not considered special or even particularly desirable.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.12
The Mosuo live in large extended families, with many generations (grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, etc.) all living together in the same house.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.13
Men sleep in communal sleeping rooms (they don't have private bedrooms); only the women have the luxury of a private bedroom.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.14
Thus, women tend to the the ones in control of relationships.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.15
Traditionally, a Mosuo woman will invite a man to spend the night with her.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.16
The man will come to her home at night, sneaking in through her window (it is also a part of the Mosuo culture that, while everyone knows this is happening, it should be done in a manner that is not obvious), spending the night, and then leaving early the next morning before everyone wakes up.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.17
Thus the term "walking marriage"...because the men must walk to and from their assigned rendevous each night.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.18
The Mosuo walking marriages are generally the most interesting -- and misunderstood -- aspects of Mosuo culture.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.19
People are always fascinated by it, but misunderstandings and misperceptions abound.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.20
One of the most common misperceptions is that the Mosuo are very promiscuous, changing partners all the time.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.21
That is patently not true; in fact, many Mosuo pairing will last for years, and even decades.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.22
There is no social stigma if someone DOES change partners often, but it is more common for the Mosuo to engage in what has been described as "serial monogamy"...that is, they don't stick with one partner for their whole life, but each pairing will tend to last for an extended period, and they won't generally have multiple partners while in a relationship.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.23
However, there are fascinating and very unique aspects of these walking marriages.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.24
First, even among couples who are together for months/years/decades, they generally will never actually live together, or share property.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.25
The man will continue to live in his family's home, and his responsibilities are to that family; while the woman will continue to live her her home, and be responsible to her family.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.26
The man will visit her at night, but the rest of the time they generally live separate lives.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.27
And what if they have a baby? In general, fathers have little or no responsibility for children produced from such unions;
DF-201-185522-35_2114.28
the baby will be raised in the mother's home, and be a part of her family, not the father's.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.29
However, that does not mean that the men have no responsibility...it is just that the focus of that responsibility is shifted.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.30
In most cultures, a man will be responsible to care for his own children;
DF-201-185522-35_2114.31
in Mosuo culture, a man is responsible to care for the children of his sisters/nieces/aunts/etc. So Mosuo men still have full parenting responsibilities...perhaps even moreso, since they may end up sharing responsibility for the children of many family members.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.32
Now, in some cases, Mosuo men DO want to be involved in their own childrens' upbringing.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.33
If that is the case, after the child is born, the father will go to the mother's home, and present the family matriarch with gifts, asking to be accepted as the father.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.34
If the matriarch accepts him, he is then an 'honorary member' of the family, and has the right to visit and/or stay there like any other family member, and to help raise the child.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.35
However, this is not a frequent practice.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.36
Although this sounds very strange at first, it actually provides remarkable stability for the children.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.37
First, they are not raised by just one parent; everyone in the family shares in parental duties, so the child really ends up having multiple father and mother figures.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.38
Furthermore, if the mother and father end their relationship, there is virtually no impact or stress for the child.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.39
There's no fighting over splitting property, because they never shared property.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.40
There's no fighting over custody of the child, because the child never belonged to the father to begin with.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.41
The mother's relationships with different men may change, but it has little or no effect on the children.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.42
One more thing I'd like to point out. While this system actually works very effectively for the Mosuo, it works ONLY in a situation where there is a large extended family to provide support.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.43
For those Mosuo men and women who leave home to live/work on their own in other cities, they almost always choose more traditional marriage.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.44
After all, caring for a baby without its father when you have 20 other people in your home to help you is one thing;
DF-201-185522-35_2114.45
caring for a baby without its father when you live by yourself is another matter entirely.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.46
For more information about the Mosuo, their culture, and our work with them, you can check out our organization's website. And I welcome questions and comments about this, or other aspects of Mosuo culture.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.47
While their way of life holds no particular allure to me (my job consists of sitting, writing on paper and thinking about things, I am allergic to horses, my greatest joy is my western traditional family of my wife and 2 daughters) I applaud your efforts to provide as unobtrusive assistance to these people as possible.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.48
Diversity of cultures and thinking is a Good Thing, and I like your organizations emphasis on putting them in control.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.49
I would suggest that you don't worry about people who suggest that you try to protect them somehow from the outside world.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.50
If the Mosuo don't want you or your organization's help, I am sure they are quite capable of telling you to get lost.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.51
When you say "we" are doing this, who is "we"?
DF-201-185522-35_2114.52
In particular, have you hooked up with the various groups like the LSA and the Endangered Languages Foundation?
DF-201-185522-35_2114.53
There's a lot -- well, by linguistics standards, a lot -- of money floating around for doing exactly this, and it sounds like Mosuo is one language that might be saveable if you can bring it to the attention of the appropriate professionals.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.54
So depending upon who the linguists you are bringing in are, it may be possible/practical to get some real heavyweights to come in for their support....
DF-201-185522-35_2114.55
Wolfman, sounds like you're doing some amazing work!
DF-201-185522-35_2114.56
The Mosuo sound like a fascinating people.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.57
Matrilineal systems are indeed rather rare.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.58
I think there used to be ( ) some in Polynesia.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.59
I don't know if property was owned by females but it was transferred through the female line (a man's heirs would be his sister's children).
DF-201-185522-35_2114.60
I think some of the Native American tribes in the U.S. plains were also matrilineal.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.61
Very interesting. What this shows, I think, is that while there is no marriage, there is also no illegitimacy -- that is, most children (a) know who their fathers are (and the fathers do not deny it, even if they have no role in caring for them) and (b) have two male and female adults (mother and her brother) take care of them.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.62
Also, it's easy to see why this social arrangement will discourage promiscuity.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.63
In general, most men will be responsible for raising, roughly, the same number of children as they have, even if they don't raise their own children.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.64
However, if you are a man who has too many partners -- or, more important, too many children -- you are probably seen as a freeloader: someone who makes society take care of their many children while only caring for a few of society's children in return.
DF-201-185522-35_2114.65
Am I correct here?
DF-201-185522-35_2114.66

DF-202-185837-43_8915.3
In the average of the last 4 polls there it looks like this:
DF-202-185837-43_8915.4
Romney 40%
DF-202-185837-43_8915.5
Paul 19%
DF-202-185837-43_8915.6
Gingrich 11%
DF-202-185837-43_8915.7
Huntsman 10%
DF-202-185837-43_8915.8
Santorum 4%
DF-202-185837-43_8915.9
Perry 2%
DF-202-185837-43_8915.10
In two of the more recent polls, between 35-40% of NH voters say they are either "likely to change their mind" or "undecided/uncommitted".

What are your vote predictions for next Tuesday?
DF-202-185837-43_8915.12
I'm gonna ramble a bit and then reveal mine.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.13
The consensus appears to be that Mitt Romney needs a big win in NH in order to propel him in SC since his Iowa result was almost to the vote the same total as 2008.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.14
No new support for Mitt.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.15
In '08, Mitt finished 2nd to McCain in NH and got 32% of the vote.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.16
How much of that 40% right now is hardcore Romney support?
DF-202-185837-43_8915.17
Inexplicably, he avoided an onslaught of attacks over the last few weeks as the focus turned on Newt, but now one of the big questions becomes about what Republicans really think about the idea of Mitt cleaning up in NH and quite possibly everywhere else, too.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.18
I think NH is a test of how comfortable or not Republicans are with Mitt as the presumptive front-runner.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.19
I think that like Iowa, he'll hold on to the support in NH he got last time.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.20
So he'll come down to earth a little bit but won't totally implode there.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.21
Everybody needs to see the Iowa speeches.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.22
Newt's was fiery and disgruntled.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.23
He's so much more interesting when he's an attack dog and he is positioning himself now as wanting to be the fullback to Rick Santorum; if he's going down, he wants to take Romney with him, and in the meantime that'll let Santorum have a positive week and float above the fray.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.24
Rick Santorum is leaving evangelical country and going into a 60% Catholic state.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.25
Between hard right establishment Catholics there and that close to 40% undecided number, Santorum should be able to get into double digits.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.26
But how high does he go?
DF-202-185837-43_8915.27
I think if Mitt comes down to the low 30's and it appears that Santorum keeps coming up and can crack 25% again, it'll be another soft-boiled Mitt non-win win.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.28
If Newt and Santorum now represent the more traditional GOP establishment and are fighting over that share in NH, Ron Paul and John Huntsman are sharing the Independent vote.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.29
Will Huntsman be NH's Santorum?
DF-202-185837-43_8915.30
Ron Paul appears ready to keep cruising around 20% and another top 3 finish.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.31
Rick Perry is totally insignificant and should have quit along with Michele Bachmann.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.32
Romney's ahead by an average of 21%.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.33
That's going to come down to earth, but how much, and how much before it's perceived that he's falling and somebody else is rising?
DF-202-185837-43_8915.34
I think the threshold is that he needs to win by 10% in order to gain any kind of traction as the front-runner.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.35
In Iowa, my predictions (actual results in parenthesis) were pretty close:
DF-202-185837-43_8915.36
Santorum 27% (25)
DF-202-185837-43_8915.37
Romney 26% (25)
DF-202-185837-43_8915.38
Paul 22% (22)
DF-202-185837-43_8915.39
Gingrich 9% (13)
DF-202-185837-43_8915.40
Perry 8% (10)
DF-202-185837-43_8915.41
Bachmann 5% (5)
DF-202-185837-43_8915.42
That was with a day or so out.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.43
This is more of a crapshoot at this point but here goes.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.44
Romney 32%
DF-202-185837-43_8915.45
Santorum 25%
DF-202-185837-43_8915.46
Paul 21%
DF-202-185837-43_8915.47
Huntsman 11%
DF-202-185837-43_8915.48
Perry 1%
DF-202-185837-43_8915.49
I'm thinking it's going to be Romney and Paul with a considerable lead, and Gingrich a distant third.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.50
I would be distinctly and pleasantly surprised if Huntsman made the top three and absolutely tickled pink if he won, but I don't see it happening.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.51
Huntsman's going to have to get some notice at the debate to finish in the top 3.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.52
If the others are attacking themselves like children, than maybe he can come up the middle and seem like the adult in the room and then NH will make a statement by elevating him to the anti-Romney surging candidate in that state.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.53
I feel like it's going to be tough for him to break out.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.54
You are probably right, Romney and Paul for sure, but once the light shines on Santorum, the NH voters aren't going to like what they see.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.55
I still see three voting blocks, Romney, Paul and Someone Else.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.56
Huntsman hasn't had a turn being Someone Else yet, and he's more appealing to NH voters than Santorum.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.57
Romney by a big number, because he lives in NH in a palatial home on Lake Winnipesaukee, and he's been working on this primary for 5 years.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.58
Paul because he'll draw a lot of independent voters, and I think Gingrich is fading along with Perry.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.59
This is all going down to how much the anti-Romney vote starts to close the divide.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.60
In the Suffolk poll for Wednesday, it was Romney 43% and Santorum 6%.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.61
Today it's a two-day total now of 41% to 8%.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.62
From a 37 point gap to a 33 point gap. Now, if it's 37 points after one day, but the two-day total is 33, that means the second-day stand alone would be 39 to 10, a 29 point gap.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.63
Meanwhile, Huntsman is down in the two-day total back to single digits.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.64
Santorum's small bump so far has costed Newt the most.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.65
Watch for him to hit the double digits in the next couple polls.
DF-202-185837-43_8915.66
Ron Paul is sailing with his strong 20%.
DF-202-185837-43_8924.1
I think the video below from a Charlie Chaplin movie is one of the best pieces that could be superimposed and run as a Ron Paul ad.
DF-202-185837-43_8924.2
I would love to see something like this run on national television.
DF-202-185837-43_8924.3
It's a preaching to the choir ad.
DF-202-185837-43_8924.4
It has no place on television because it doesn't speak to the undecideds.
DF-202-185837-43_8924.5
Near the end you could replace the "Ron Paul" chants with any other candidate and it would have the same effect.
DF-202-185837-43_8924.6
There's nothing in it that speaks of Paul's views or intended policies.
DF-202-185837-43_8924.7
Lastly, negative ads are far more effective than positive ones.

Are you a communist?
DF-202-185837-44_1667.2
My friend and I walked into a pizza shop.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.3
It was $3 a slice.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.4
They had a special, a 12-slice for $10.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.5
If we both got two slices each, that would make it 4 slices at a total of $12.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.6
We were assured the slices in the 12-slice were the same size, so we got that.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.7
We each pitched in $5 each (which can't even buy you two slices oddly enough) and got 6 slices each, which we've just polished off in fairly record time.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.8
We pooled our resources and struck the better deal for the both of us, and we actually made a joke about proud and full communists.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.9
Now we're rolling a joint from a bag of weed we each pitched in on in order to save money as well.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.10
Got our usual amount of weed each, but each paid $5 less because one of us did the transaction and bought twice as much as usual for the individual.

If these things make me a communist, than I'll drink to that, but I just call it better business sense mostly.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.12
Real communism would be they could go get a pizza without paying at all, and the pizza guy could come by their auto-parts place to pick up a distributor cap without paying at all.

The problem you are having Jason Marcel is that it is impossible for many people, and especially people in America, to conceive of cooperation and sacrifice without force behind it.

They are so locked into their little me-centric universes that they can't see cooperating with someone else unless someone makes them.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.16
Seriously, I think the problem here is that a lot of people in the U.S., conservatives especially, when they hear the word "communism" think of the Soviet Union.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.17
Not only was the Soviet Union not communist, it didn't even pretend to be.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.18
The word refers in Marxist theory only to the end stage of social progress, what a socialist state and economy evolve into: a stateless utopia in which everything is shared equally.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.19
When communism is reached, socialism is no more, because socialism presumes the existence of the state, and under communism there is no state.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.20
The motto under socialism is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his WORK." Under communism, it's the more-familiar, "from each according to his ability, to each according to his NEED."
DF-202-185837-44_1667.21
The Soviet Union was socialist.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.22
It never pretended to be communist, even though it was governed by something called the Communist Party.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.23
Communism was what they were in theory evolving towards, but certainly not what they already had.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.24
Communism is not a coercive system; it's the exact opposite.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.25
Neither the private coercion of capitalism, nor the state coercion of socialism is found in a communist society.
DF-202-185837-44_1667.26
If it were possible to have a communist society, it would be a wonderful thing.

What do you guys think about a Ron Paul run for president in 2012.
DF-202-185837-44_2871.2
Though he's kind of old, he is still sharp and incredibly intelligent - and consistent.
DF-202-185837-44_2871.3
His voting record is very consistent and he doesn't vote for any legislation that isn't expressly allowed by the Constitution.
DF-202-185837-44_2871.4
Given this, the grassroots support he had in 2008, and the fact that his message is very closely aligned with that of the tea party movement, do think he could head either a tea party (or more likely) GOP ticket.

Habemus Papademos!
DF-202-185843-42_9098.2
Finally after days of intense political infight in Athens the new prime minister seems to be the biggest favourite for the job: Lucas Papademos.
DF-202-185843-42_9098.3
He is an ex-ECB vice president.
DF-202-185843-42_9098.4
But foremost he is not a career politician as his profession is actually an academic one, partly in the US where he also studied.
DF-202-185843-42_9098.5
Papademos seems to be well respected in the EU but also within Greece, as far as a Greek Prime minister could be respected in a country like Greece where being politician has a worse reputation than being a bank robber.
DF-202-185843-42_9098.6
I am positively surprised about this choice.
DF-202-185843-42_9098.7
At least someone took over who has an understanding of economics in quite some detail and is not from the old political class.

I don't think one could have hoped for anything better than that.

On another note. There are rumors that Mario Monti could become the next prime minister of Italy.

Monti, also dubbed "Super Mario", is a former EU commissioner and will still ring some bells for example in Redmond, simply because it was him who did not shy away from taking a fight with an extreme heavyweight like Microsoft over anti-trust issues.

He wasn't the head of the ECB but one of the Vice Presidents, ie in the governing council of the ECB. For all the shortcomings of the Euro, I can't see how the ECB has done a bad job.
DF-202-185843-42_9098.18
He seems to be a really clever guy, understanding economics like few prime ministers in the world probably, as he teaches it in Harvard I think.

Eva Kaili would have been a great choice.

I think I'm one of those who likes watching the Superbowl for all the new ads.
DF-202-185845-34_2040.2
Ferris Bueller was alright and Seinfeld was pretty funny, but Clint Eastwood's ad for Chrysler makes them the winner two years in a row after Eminem's wicked ad for them last year.
DF-202-185845-34_2040.3
I believe Eastwood is speaking from the heart, that's why I think it's such an amazing and curious ad since it looks and feels so much like the kind of thing the Obama campaign would find favorable to them.
DF-202-185845-34_2040.4

He endorsed John McCain last time out.

Hasn't endorsed anyone in that field yet, but says he likes Ron Paul.

He says he wouldn't call himself a hardcore conservative or an extreme lefty.
DF-202-185845-34_2040.11
From the stuff he is for and against in recent years, it paints a picture of the kind of voter that will decide the election, and I think Eastwood taps into that feeling of wanting to make a comeback happen.
DF-202-185845-34_2040.12
There's something to be gained by this guy's performance, a man of rugged self-reliance who also took the time to acknowledge in the ad that "we all pulled together", his tip of that of course to the bailouts which he is supportive of.
DF-202-185845-34_2040.13
The candidate who will win the election is the one who can tap into that emotion too.

Army, you had me worried there for a minute as "they should peg it " means to die.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.13
Service Pensions are "pegged" to inflation but usually capped to 2%ish per annum, not much more.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.14
Servicemen should be recieving..Service Pension and State pension and if they are lucky a Works pension.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.15
Times are hard and the forecast for the near future does not look too rosy.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.16
The retirement age in the UK is due to rise in the future, at the moment retirement is 65 and Government wants to raise it to 70.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.17
I must say I also have little sympathy in this case.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.18
Assuming h retired out of choice and was not wounded, then it really is your own responsibility to handle your finances in my opinion.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.19
The forces are just a job like any other after all.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.20
This very thing was driven home during my first retirement class.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.21
In the USMC you are required to attend the first day of a week long retirement seminar.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.22
The other days are optional.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.23
But your choice not your units.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.24
Around the middle of the day, the leader of the seminar started asking us if we were coming back the next day.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.25
About 70% (almost all combat arms guys) said "No, We have things we need to do at our unit."
DF-212-191665-313_2054.26
He said you all spent at least 20 yrs doing things for the Corps. Now take a week for yourself and be informed before you retire.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.27
If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they kick you out the door talk to a retiree.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.28
No one from HQMC will call you to see how things are going.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.29
No one will call you a month later to see if you have a job yet or if there is anything they can help you with.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.30
And you know what?
DF-212-191665-313_2054.31
No one ever did in an official capacity.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.32
The only thing I ever got from them was a "We want you to come back on active duty as a full time reservist."
DF-212-191665-313_2054.33
You will have to give up your retirement and disability payments.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.34
Once we are done with you the retirement checks won't start again until your 65 since you will be considered a reservist.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.35
And you will have to start over from square 1 with the VA.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.36
The Corps needs you, don't let us down."
DF-212-191665-313_2054.37
I had better things to do.
DF-212-191665-313_2054.38
i think I let them down.

Aircraft dropped in an apparent decompression state with passengers on oxygen from 40K in a controlled dive.

Cause of the hole is unknown, aircraft is not old, being delivered in 1991.
DF-212-191665-313_2552.4
I'm sure that it must have been alarming for all concerned.
DF-212-191665-313_2552.5
The hole is enormous.

DF-212-191666-303_0145.1
Let me open with a brief reminder (or history lesson) of one of the reasons I first started watching this show:
DF-212-191666-303_0145.2
Now that was funny.
DF-212-191666-303_0145.3
Craig Killborn was funny...
DF-212-191666-303_0145.4
"The Daily Show" back then had 'ass-kicking' interviews...
DF-212-191666-303_0145.5
Oh, yeah, and "Five Questions" (a wholy owned subsidiary of Craig Industries...)
DF-212-191666-303_0145.6
Now we have a sitting Vice-President appearing on this show...
DF-212-191666-303_0145.7
Granted, a new host (and granted the second clip wasn't from the original "Daily Show") but this is a news show?
DF-212-191666-303_0145.8
I'd put in the Biden clip, only 'twasn't to be found on the intar-tubes... How droll...
DF-212-191666-303_0145.9
Anyhow, when did the "Daily Show" become such an institution of news that sitting heads of state would appear on such a thing?
DF-212-191666-303_0145.10
I guess it got gravity when lots of young kids starting watching.
DF-212-191666-303_0145.11
But you have to realize, Obama went on Leno, Bill Clinton and Madeline Albright have been on the Daily Show, and every Democratic candidate for governor went on the Colbert Report.
DF-212-191666-303_0145.12
The daily show is fun and very successful.
DF-212-191666-303_0145.13
Puts paid to the whole O Reilly Fox crap that no one watches liberals.
DF-212-191666-303_0145.14
Jon Stewart has a great job...he can give absolute free range to his opinions without any restrictions that the regular news show have.
DF-212-191666-303_0145.15
It's no more a news show than O'Riley, Beck, Olberman etc.
DF-212-191666-303_0145.16
it's a comedy show that has some commentary, Stewart would be the last one to say it's news.
DF-212-191666-303_0145.17
If anyone is using this a real source of news, they need to get out more.
DF-212-191666-303_0145.18
But still, he makes me laugh and most of the time I think he has good points to be considered.
DF-212-191666-303_0145.19
I know this clip is older, but I think he hits the nail on the head regarding most of the commentary shows.
DF-212-191666-303_0145.20
it's supposedly news satire, though amusingly it's almost just as informative if not more than the actual news shows running these days.
DF-212-191666-303_0145.21
Obviously Stewart has some political message of his own thrown in.
DF-212-191666-303_0145.22
Similar shows appear in other countries as people get sick of how every news talk show end up being either a pure propaganda's machine for one particular side or a bickering debate that doesn't make sense to anyone.
DF-212-191666-303_0145.23

Keep government away from the internet.
DF-212-191666-303_0257.7
Just read the actual law and the analysis.
DF-212-191666-303_0257.8
This law isn't what it seems to be.
DF-212-191666-303_0257.9
Are they ever?
DF-212-191666-303_0257.10
The first rule of lawmaking is give the bill a name that is exactly the opposite of what it really does.

An emerging issue, how concerned are you over drug violence in Mexico?
DF-212-191666-303_0671.2
What potential do you see for drug violence to spill over more into the United States?
DF-212-191666-303_0671.3
Do you believe it to be enough of a threat that necessitates the US to take more action to do something about it, and if so, what action should that be? (e.g. border fence/wall, training for the Mexican police/military, monetary aid to the Mexican government, etc.)
DF-212-191666-303_0671.4
This poll is intended for Americans.
DF-212-191666-303_0671.5
The drug violence in Mexico started when the Mexican president decided to "get tough" on the drug cartels.
DF-212-191666-303_0671.6
Guess what?
DF-212-191666-303_0671.7
They fought back.
DF-212-191666-303_0671.8
Just like the futile war on drugs in the US, the drug war in Mexico will have no greater success.
DF-212-191666-303_0671.9
Fighting a war you can't win is not noble.
DF-212-191666-303_0671.10
It's stupid.
DF-212-191666-303_0671.11
Stop fighting the war on drugs and the violence will go down.
DF-212-191666-303_0671.12
We need to get the government out of the prohibition game once and for all.
DF-212-191666-303_0671.13
Legalize it, regulate it, and control it (and tax it, too!).
DF-212-191666-303_0671.14
These drug killings are no different than Al Capone killing people during alcohol prohibition.
DF-212-191666-303_0671.15
Once drug dealing (AKA beer, wine, and liquor sales) became legal and regulated, murders in America dropped dramatically.
DF-212-191666-303_0671.16
Plus we stopped locking people up because they wanted to get drunk.
DF-212-191666-303_0671.17
There's more about this on my Cop in the Hood blog.
DF-212-191666-303_1625.1
Recently i learned about Obama's service plan, yeah may be late but better than never, and this is bothering me.
DF-212-191666-303_1625.2
According to his website and other sources I understand Obama's might mandate 100 Hours of Service per year when in College in exchange to $4000 of tuition credit.
DF-212-191666-303_1625.3
To add this his Chief of Staff Rahm Emmanuel has confirmed on 10th Nov to draft a plan in this regard.
DF-212-191666-303_1625.4
Further the following is a quote form Emmanuel's Book, The Plan: Big Ideas for America,
DF-212-191666-303_1625.5
If they are just to be "asked", then it sounds like a great deal.
DF-212-191666-303_1625.6
Though if it were, I see zero reason to limit it to college students age 18 - 25. If it's required it's nothing more than a civil service draft, slavery.
DF-212-191666-303_1625.7
Might as well be forcing 'em to work the cotton...
DF-212-191666-303_1625.8
Either way, good luck getting a bunch of drunk/stoned college kids to add that workload to their college and job workloads.
DF-212-191666-303_1625.9
as long as their just asking
DF-212-191666-303_1625.10
IMO its a fair price to pay.
DF-212-191666-303_1625.11
This coming from someone that footed their own college tuition, No mommy and daddy allowences, no grants or anything else.
DF-212-191666-303_1625.12
And it will keep them out of trouble and teach them some things as well.
DF-212-191666-303_1625.13
IMO a good call and for some perhaps a way to look at things in a much better perspective.
DF-212-191666-303_1625.14
Awesome, $40/hr, that's more than what I make.
DF-212-191666-303_1625.15
Lets' see... 100 hours of service for $4000 credit.

thats if they do not mandate... but if mandate... that's communism... that the first step....
DF-212-191666-303_1625.18
I think it is an excellent idea, people should be made aware of what to do in a crisis.

Obama will have to do something over the top like the four previous Presidents before him did.
DF-212-191666-303_1676.11
This savagery seems to be a requirement to prove one has the mettle to be "tough."
DF-212-191666-303_1676.12
Nevermind that really being tough is working out a solution that doesn't require bloodshed.
DF-212-191666-303_1676.13

As far Obama is concern, I would rather wait for his cabinet appointees...
DF-212-191666-303_1676.15
To make bold predictions on what Obama will do as president or what he will fail to do as president, one must wait to see who are the all the players.

DF-212-191666-303_1676.23

Because 10 is not enough?

How else can you muscle in on someone else's turf?
DF-212-191666-303_1676.32
Park a few carriers off the coast and make sure the despot doesn't stray too far from the "American interest" angle.

"Careful this floor board squeaks...cant sneak in late down this hallway"

Do the Bushs show them around?

What if the Obamas just have a personality conflict with a maid or something?
DF-212-191666-303_1700.19
Can they just fire them at will and have a new one sent over?

Could they keep a pet giraffe on the grounds if they wanted to?
DF-212-191666-303_1700.21
If they wanted to get rid of the bowling alley and put in a discoteque could they do it?

Do they have to put a "Do Not Disturb" sign on their bedroom door, or can they just lock it when they want some undisturbed time?
DF-212-191666-303_1700.23
And does the secret service knock and wait for an answer or just go charging into the bedrooms/bathrooms.

I wonder if they have ever "walked in" on a president.
DF-212-191666-303_1700.26
There is this really nice site on the White House

Very detailed info and pictures of most of the important rooms, spanning several eras.

As per Anderson 360, the Incoming First Family get $100,000 to do any changes to their living quarters of about 16 room.
DF-212-191666-303_1700.33
Also, any change that they can do is after consultation with historians, since ostensibly any change they would do would become a part of the nation's history
DF-212-191666-303_1700.34
That does not seem much, especially after considering the extensive changes some previous presidents did.

We have a Parade on or about Veterans Day in November down Atlantic Avenue in North Long Beach.
DF-212-191667-307_3266.3
We have been doing this for several years now and have had many varied entrants including Mexican prancer horses, re-enactors in various uniforms (including WW I and WW II German), Cavalry units of various countries (the WW II German cavalry"man" was actually a pretty girl using the helmet to hide her hair).

This year we are being "asked" to include an Anti-War unit in the parade made up mostly of people protesting the war in Iraq.
DF-212-191667-307_3266.6
Any ideas on this?
DF-212-191667-307_3266.7
Besides the initial mistrust of "not believeing" they will not disrupt the parade, unless they are willing to sign a document stating they will honour the ones who gave the ultimate sacrifice, and give thanks to the ones who are currently fighting to ensure they "can have an opinion" and not in anyway disrupt the parade....then I would say no they cannot join the parade.......

If they will sign said socument then welcome to the parade.
DF-212-191667-307_3266.9
I would guess both groups want to politicise the event, which is after all to honour veterans, not make a political statement.
DF-212-191667-307_3266.10
If they want a political rally, they can organise their own,
DF-212-191667-307_3266.11
if they want to participate as veterans then nobody's stopping them from parading with their units.

Also the LPD 17 San Antonio class will be trucated at eight ships IMHO(some say seven others nine and nine have already been named).
DF-212-191673-310_8652.10
This would also open up the possibility of prematurely decommissioning ships as many as four LSD 41 Whidbey Island class ships now turning 20 years old.

IEDs: The Lazy Man's Insurgency
DF-212-191678-309_0211.2
It's time to take another look at Iraq, because there's been a big change in insurgent tactics in 2005. That's inevitable. War makes people on both sides think faster. Peacetime armies never learn anything; wartime armies learn new tricks faster than a hungry raccoon.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.3
The big change is that the insurgents have decided to rely on IEDs rather than ambushes with shoulder-fired weapons to kill the two or three GIs per day they figure they need to wear down the US public's will to stay in the fight. And it's working, way too well.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.4
The stats are clear: IED victims make up a bigger chunk of our casualties every month. Over the last six months, IEDs have caused 63% of US combat deaths. Last month (October 2005) was typical: out of 96 US troops killed, IEDs were responsible for 57.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.5
Compare that with April 2004, a terrible month when we lost 140 troops. Back then the insurgents relied on RPGs and small arms. Only 19 of our 140 KIA that month-barely more than a tenth-were killed by IEDs.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.6
The insurgents have decided to do it the easy way. As long as they can use IEDs, their low-tech standoff weapon, why should they risk close combat?
DF-212-191678-309_0211.7
The real question is why they can get away with it. And here-well, I hate to keep saying this, but somebody needs to. The reason they can do it is because we still have NO INTEL on them. It's the biggest failure of the war, and nobody talks about it. CI warfare is about people, not hardware. We're all hardware and no intelligence, like a Tim Allen show. Makes me sick.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.8
That makes the decision to go with IEDs a no-brainer for the insurgents. In the standard ambush, the kind we were facing a year ago, the insurgents detonated an IED under a convoy, then opened up on the stalled survivors with RPG and small arms fire. It probably made them feel good, sort of their version of shock and awe, but the rifle fire was ineffective and by concentrating their forces, the insurgents made themselves vulnerable to our air power.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.9
The problem in any guerrilla battle is the getaway. Anybody can pull a trigger; the trick is getting your men home safe, while enemy choppers zoom through the sky and every street is full of troops and armor looking for men of military age. That's the tough part.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.10
An IED ambush has none of those risks. Only one man needs to be on the spot-the triggerman. He detonates the IED from a car parked down a side street and drives away before the occupiers can even start their search. No risk. No casualties. Very demoralizing for the occupiers, especially since they know damn well that everybody in the neighborhood was in on the attack but they can't level the locals' shacks like they're dying to.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.11
What makes this wave of IEDs worse is that the devices are getting more effective. Frankly I've been shocked at how good the Iraqis are with these things right from the start. I mean, after that shameful performance in GW I, did you expect these bastards to be so sneaky, patient, and smart? I knew this war was a bad idea, but even I never realized what we'd be up against.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.12
The scariest tech development of all is that the insurgents have learned how to make shaped-charged IEDs. To understand why shaped charges are such a powerful weapon, we have to go into the incredibly cool world of explosive physics. I love this stuff. I mean, what red-blooded American boy didn't experiment with explosives? The only reason I ever opened my Chem book was to see if it mentioned TNT or dynamite in the index. (It didn't-goddamn hippie teachers.) And naturally I used the local wildlife, like toads and bees, in my experiments with the killing power of firecrackers.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.13
What I learned was the most important point about the subject: blast alone doesn't do a good job of killing the target. A bee would wobble off unhurt after one of my 4th of July daisycutters went off right next to it.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.14
Now before you hotheads whose hobby is making pipe bombs in the garage write me angry letters (or send me long round packages with no return address), I know a blast can kill, if it's a big enough blast. We had a really nasty example of that in August this year, when a huge IED killed 14 Marines near Haditha. From what I've read, investigation showed there was nothing special about the IED. It was just three anti-tank mines stacked in a pile-the IHOP of IEDs, I guess you could call it.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.15
That ambush showed real clearly how important intelligence is in guerrilla warfare. The same unit that suffered the IED attack had just had six of its snipers killed in a small-arms ambush. Now you tell me how anybody can ambush six snipers unless they've completely penetrated the unit. The insurgents knew where the unit's snipers would assemble, and they knew where the vehicle would be passing. We don't know a thing about the enemy, but it's clear that he knows way too much about us.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.16
The other problem is that the 14 Marines were riding in one of those ridiculous landing crafts the Corps uses as APCs-in Haditha, hundreds of clicks from the sea! It's called the AAV-7A1, and it looks like a giant armored dinghy. Since it was designed to ferry troops ashore, it sacrifices armor and speed and damn near everything else to an amphibious capability that has no use anymore. But that's the Corps for you. Real brave, but not always real smart.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.17
Maybe if those guys had been in a real APC some would have survived. I can't say. If the blast is big enough, it can kill even an MBT. The Pals took out two Israeli Merkavas, the best-armored tanks in the world, with simple blast IEDs.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.18
But most of the time, guerrillas don't have the delivery systems to depend on blast power. If they're trying to kill soft targets-i.e. people-they pack the bomb with homemade shrapnel: roofing nails, ball bearings, anything that'll shred flesh. A suicide vest tipped with nails is basically a 360-degree 12 gauge.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.19
To kill GIs that way, you need to catch them off-guard, somewhere they feel safe. That's what happened when a Jihadi killed more than a dozen of our guys in a mess hall in Mosul while they were having lunch -- minus their body armor.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.20
In the field, US troops are a hard kill, especially because they move in armored convoys protected by choppers. And that's the real beauty of IED attacks for a guerrilla: they absolutely nullify US air power. There are literally no targets for the attack choppers. The pilots know damn well that one of those Iraqi cars driving away from the scene is carrying the guy who set off the IED, but there's no way to tell which one.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.21
In a strange way, we're looking at a 3D war. We control the air, but the Iraqis literally control the underground, thanks to these buried IEDs. We fly, they dig.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.22
The insurgents' first IEDs were simple. Not that there's anything wrong with simple. The weapons that have been hurting us are all simple, like the RPG. Simplicity is the guerrilla's friend.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.23
Those early IEDs were usually just shells buried by the road, wired up to a detonator. Lots of amateurs were tinkering in their garages, or whatever Iraqis have instead of garages, playing with stuff that goes boom. And naturally lots of those guys went boom themselves.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.24
Like I said, war teaches people fast, but some of the lessons have to be learned by the next of kin, not the handyman whose bright idea for a new type of bomb turned him into an abstract painting all over his wall.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.25
Sometimes an insurgency has to learn its lessons several times. Take the case of pressure-triggered IEDs. These are basically standard anti-vehicle mines, with something like a bathroom scale as trigger. People and cars can pass over them unharmed, but if a really heavy (meaning armored) vehicle rolls over that scale, the bomb goes off. (Trucks are a problem. Some trucks weigh as much as an APC.) The best part is that you don't even need a triggerman to set it off. You can all be off at the hookah parlor polishing up your alibis when it goes off.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.26
The insurgents in Baqouba used pressure bombs in 2003, but they usually failed to go off. Their bombmakers didn't have the technique yet.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.27
Thanks to info-sharing, the internet gives an insurgency, they're back at it, with better wiring diagrams. A week ago (Oct. 24 '05), a pressure bomb shredded a Humvee in Baqouba, tearing four GIs legs to pieces.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.28
The first IEDs were mostly mortar rounds that failed against our armor. So the insurgents went to big 155mm rounds. That's a big, big shell and when you trigger it at the right moment, it's going to kill almost anything but an M1.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.29
The M1 is a great tank, so it's kind of scary to read the stats on how many of them the insurgents have managed to knock out. As usual, the invasion was the easy part and the occupation was when things got lethal. We only lost 18 M1s in the conventional fighting, but the guerrillas have since managed to disable 80. Now most of those are track damage, but that's enough to put a tank out of action.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.30
The good news is that the M1 has lived up to its rep for crew protection. The Army's Armor Center says only five crew have died in IED attacks on M1s. (Ten other M1 crew have been killed, mostly by sniper fire, riding in open hatches.)
DF-212-191678-309_0211.31
So if you're an insurgent bomb-maker, your goal is to find a way to kill M1s. Not just knock a tread off, but destroy it and kill the crew. And that's where the shaped-charge IED comes in. Shaped charges were developed for tank killing, used in MBT anti-armor rounds and antitank weapons. Their warheads are basically thick cups of soft metal. Metals with low melting points, usually copper. The bomb-maker's job is to make sure as much of the force of the blast is channeled to the copper cone as possible. So sometimes he'll put several 155mm shells beneath the copper, or pack a whole lot of TNT under it.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.32
When the IED detonates, this copper cup turns into a shaft of superheated metal that can zip right through any armor, even an M1's. That's what they tell me, and I have to believe it.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.33
It's the kind of weird science that used to frustrate me in Physics, the sort of info you just have to take on faith. I can't help wondering if they're kidding us civvies about it all. I don't get why a soft metal like copper can penetrate Chobham armor, which can defeat almost any warhead around.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.34
Apparently the copper isn't even actually molten. It ejects as a solid; it just "behaves like molten metal." I'm sure the insurgent Home Improvement tinkerers don't understand the science involved any more than I do. They just hear that it works and try it out.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.35
The US countermeasures have been pretty lame so far. Convoys travel with jammers that make it harder to detonate the IED by cell phone or garage door opener-Nokia and Genie sales are going to drop in the Sunni Triangle. But like I said, low-tech is the guerrilla's friend. These days they've gone back to wires, and I hear some are even using string. You can't jam a string.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.36
Beyond that, Bush policy is to blame Iran, or Syria, or Satan or whoever.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.37
Iran? Maybe. Syria? No way. Syria's scared to death, ready to do anything to make Uncle Sam happy. And if it is Iran, what can we do about it? There are still a few neocons so totally out of their little gourds they want us to invade Iran. I have to wonder if they're agents of Dr Evil, programmed to destroy America. Because invading Iran would do it, it'd end us once and for all.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.38
This blame stuff is a sign of frustration. Nobody knows how to stop IEDs, even with all the Popular Mechanics geeks sending in their garage-tech brainstorms. That's because-damn, how many times do I have to repeat it?-guerrilla war has no technical solution. Or even military solution. The only effective CI techniques are torture, reprisal and, ultimately, genocide.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.39
My guess is that genocide will come back one day. That was how the Ancients dealt with rebellious towns: wiped 'em out. One of these days some first-world country is going to get impatient and a problem child like the Sunni Triangle will be a big, radioactive ghost town.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.40
If we don't do it, the Kurds may end up doing it the old-fashioned way they learned from the Turks: one bullet, one village at a time. It's been done before -- seen any Armenians up there lately? Probably not, but most of "Kurdistan" used to be "Armenia." A few of the Armenians made it to Fresno, but the rest are buried up there.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.41
We're talking about Mesopotamia here, the place where war was invented. Hundreds of peoples have been wiped out forever in those parts. All these Holocaust lobbyists get furious if anybody says Jews aren't the only tribe to get genocided, but that's just politics-"Our genocide is better than your genocide!"
DF-212-191678-309_0211.42
The fact is, genocide is, historically, the most common result when one tribe runs into another. And something tells me the next big wipeout will happen right there in Central Iraq.

A few superficial criticisms:

1. It's not CI (counter-intelligence). CI is when you thwart your enemy's intel operations. Thus, gaining intel on when/where the insurgents are planting IEDs is intel, not counter-intel.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.50
2. Iraqis don't have garages at their houses. Thus, I would conclude that this guy has never stepped foot in Iraq.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.51
Some meaty criticisms:
DF-212-191678-309_0211.52
1. The Marine's AAV is as armored as the standard Army APC - the M113. It sounds as if this pundit is probably a former Army guy. Based on the damage to the single AAV that was involved, unless it were a M-1, more armor wouldn't have helped. That's how big the IEDs are getting.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.53
2. A single 155mm round doesn't do any significant damage to US armored vehicles (the up-armored HMMWV isn't a true armored vehicle in the sense that it was designed from the ground up with armor in mind - it was modified from a cargo vehicle). For example, on the Stryker, a 155mm round will scratch some paint off and flatten tires.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.54
3. War is like a sport. It is interactive and tactics, techniques, and procedures evolve continuously in reaction to your opponent. Back to the sports analogy, if you're getting killed in a zone defense, you switch to man-to-man, etc. He seems to apply a template that the enemies of the US should be dumb and not react. Underestimating your enemy is a bad and dumb thing to do.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.55
4. He fails to mention the intel that we get that allows us to defuse the majority of IEDs before they are detonated.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.56
5. He fails to mention how switching back to wired devices makes it easier to catch the trigger man.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.57
6. He fails to mention how using larger devices means that you need to spend more time preparing the site, which means a greater chance of compromise.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.58
7. He complains about intel, but then advocates harsh techniques that run contrary to the values of the US and doesn't weigh the impact that these techniques would have on gaining intel from the population and/or bringing the population off the fence and to our side. His recommendations would result is less intelligence - gaining some information from a paid triggerman may result in a few short-term successes within a particular cell, but it will alienate the population and result is less intel over the long-run from the population and future cells that would be created down the road due the increased perception of occupation through the harsh techniques he advocates. As an example, Abu Ghraib, which was the direct result of a half-dozen irresponsible individuals that were able to conduct their abuses due to the lacking leadership of their supervisors, had a huge negative impact on our relations with local Iraqis. The trust we had built with many was eroded and our ability to gain trust with others was much more challenging.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.59
Bottomline, he doesn't truly analyze the situation from all aspects and uses some faulty assumptions and some facts that are flat out wrong. In the end, you have the action-reaction-counteraction cycle that is producing bigger IEDs that are easier to catch, but more deadly if you don't catch it. I'm not stating that it's not a problem, but this analysis doesn't offer much value.
DF-212-191678-309_0211.60
I hope this helps. As far approaches to COIN, I'm sure that Ray, Lemontree, Dave Angel, and some of the others on this board whose militaries have been doing COIN for much longer than the US (which, BTW has done COIN quite frequently, but then shuns it as a freak occurance and doesn't internalize the lessons learned in favor on focusing on the "big threat") can comment at length on why this article espouses the wrong approach to the problem.
DF-212-191682-305_7587.1
I'm just wondering what Indian posters think your government's reaction would be if Australia asked for finished nuclear weapons and missiles, plus nuclear know how, with you for under the table shipments of yellowcake for your nuclear weapons program?
DF-212-191682-305_7587.2
You see, I'm hoping that one day befor it is too late that Australia will wake up to the fact that we can't rely on the US to be willing to lose a city over us by holding true on the 'nuclear umbrella', if ever we had a conflict with China.
DF-212-191682-305_7587.3
By shipping you yellowcake from say a secret source on defence land acqured for 'training', we could keep it outside the NPT inspection treaty process so you can build bombs with it.
DF-212-191682-305_7587.4
We ould even fly in vetted Indian miners (with training) to avoid the secret getting out here. It would benefit us by allowing payments to be made outside our budget approprations process, which is transparent.
DF-212-191682-305_7587.5
Once we have our missiles we can announce that we are joining you in the non-aligned movement, transport weapons grade uranium between us openly and generally ignore all the complaints it would generate and other peoples wars, just like you do now.
DF-212-191682-305_7587.6
Does this work for you?
DF-212-191682-305_7587.7
It wouldn't be that hard for Australia to build nukes by yourselves.
DF-212-191682-305_7587.8
Involving outsiders usually increases the amount of headaches you have to deal with.
DF-212-191682-305_7587.9
IMO, Every "first world" - technologically modern nation could probably do it today - some have chosen not to (like Japan and Germany) perhaps because of history?
DF-212-191682-305_7587.10
I think Australia probably could do it if they wanted too, and the rest of the world wouldn't object as much as they would if one of the historically agressive non-nuclear nations did it.
DF-212-191682-305_7587.11
A lot of the nuclear weapons tech that was unattainabe 20-30 years ago is attaintable now. It would be very expensive, and there would be consequences.
DF-212-191682-305_7587.12
Why should we sell?
DF-212-191682-305_7587.13
The only reasons we would were if we really needed the money or if the yellowcake were not available elsewhere or if you were the only ones who had something we really needed from an existential perspective as barter.
DF-212-191682-305_7587.14
It could and would probably work if India were to place their own nukes under Indian control onto Australian soil.
DF-212-191682-305_7587.15
For your defense and our own.
DF-212-191682-305_7587.16
Expanding deterrent.
DF-212-191682-305_7587.17
But then you have that option already with the US, so the fact that you ask this question probably points to a drift in confidence or the fact that you feel you would be able to better control an Indian nuke umbrella to your prime advantage versus a US one.

Tired of the ever-hulking, always-advancing glacier of DVD and BD cases in my living room, I've procured a media server and a Boxee box to run it.

What the game would be like ?
DF-212-191693-304_1507.3
So far its a split between semi-scifi(Halo ) or literally modernwarfare2(COD4) with new maps and missions..
DF-212-191693-304_1507.4
COD 5 was a disappointment when they decided to go back to the same old world war 2 theme..
DF-212-191693-304_1507.5
I'd personally prefer them adding new maps and missions to COD4...
DF-212-191693-304_1507.6
COD4 to me was the best real-war based FPS...
DF-212-191693-304_1507.7
maybe more 'politically bold missions' like Chechnya,Kashmir,Afghanistan,NWFP/Waziristan..maybe even Cuba/N.Korea..
DF-212-191693-304_1507.8
Just hope they dont overdo the middle-eastern theme which they pulled off so well in COD4
DF-212-191693-304_1507.9
If it is "semi-scifi"(they're rumored to be looking for a sci-fi title)..
DF-212-191693-304_1507.10
I'm stumped..
DF-212-191693-304_1507.11
how'd they possibly pull-off semi scifi without looking like a bad copy of Halo..
DF-212-191693-304_1507.12
They should do some type of geurilla warfare game set in a wartorn African or South American country.
DF-212-191693-304_1507.13
That could be interesting, like a FPS Contra.
DF-212-191693-304_1507.14

Since many of our troops are stuck in Iraq, it is likely that we may not have the resources to be able to send troops to Iran.
DF-212-191695-308_4953.2
So there is great likelihood that Israel may act alone.
DF-212-191695-308_4953.3
Although Israel has greater air and ground superiority then Iran, Iran has larger numbers of troops and have long range missles that can reach Israel.
DF-212-191695-308_4953.4
Israel in the past has sucessfully fought off nations with larger numbers of troops before a prime example being the six day war.
DF-212-191695-308_4953.5
So would Israel be able to act alone or would US military intervention still be required to attack Iran?
DF-212-191695-308_4953.6
Israel would find it hard enough to conduct air raids on Iran, let alone fighting a large scale war.
DF-212-191695-308_4953.7
The distances are simply too great for Israel to be able to project much power against Iran.
DF-212-191695-308_4953.8
I don't think Israel could act alone.
DF-212-191695-308_4953.9
If they attacked Iran unilaterally, it would probably be a large mission aimed at taking out Iran's nuclear infrastructure.
DF-212-191695-308_4953.10
They would have a hard go of it.
DF-212-191695-308_4953.11
Iran in retaliation would launch its long range missiles at Israel, as well as encouraging Hezbollah to harass Israel.
DF-212-191695-308_4953.12
I think any Israeli action against Iran would involve bringing the US into the war, I think its the only way Israel can really do enough damage to make the whole effort worthwhile.

Sorry, long story.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.2
First off a little info..
DF-215-192297-636_8305.3
Marshall amplification has been one of the leading guitar amplifier companies for 50 years.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.4
Many of the older amps are being restored and also there are countless companies offering clones and cloned replacement parts for DIY'ers.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.5
Since I like wood working I thought some folks would enjoy an amplifier shell that they could finish themselves and either use it to restore an old Marshall amplifier or to collect aftermarket parts from countless other vendors and end up with a Vintage Marshall clone.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.6
So, I have had pretty good luck selling these wooden amp head shells in the past and thought I would reintroduce my product.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.7
Well, Ebay pulled my listing for having the word "Marshall" in the title.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.8
My actual listing read "Marshall style plexi/JCM800 headshell for project."
DF-215-192297-636_8305.9
Notice the word "style".
DF-215-192297-636_8305.10
I did a quick ebay search using "Marshall style" and came up with 100's of listings that use that term for after market parts and kits.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.11
The listings I clicked on were NOT actaul Marshall products.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.12
I also searched another famous amplifier company and typed in "Fender style".
DF-215-192297-636_8305.13
Again 100's of listings for aftermarket parts and kits.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.14
Why was I singled out when there are 1,000's and 1,000's of people listing this way?
DF-215-192297-636_8305.15
And its clear that I did not claim it was an actual "Marshall" product which is why I put the word "style" in the listing.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.16
Does not seem right.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.17
People who are looking for these items won't find them without knowing that it is for a Marshall or Marshall style amp.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.18
I love the smell of packaging tape in the morning.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.19
Can't use the manufacturer's name in the title unless the item being listed is actually made by the manufacturer.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.20
eBay rules - not mine.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.21
Michael's right - someone somewhere decided to report you, and you ended up getting a wrist-slap.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.22
You -could- start reporting all the "style" listings you found and (hopefully) watch them go away.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.23
Sometimes it only takes one report... sometimes you gotta stay on top of it for a while.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.24
There are special rules for what you want to do, offering non-brand replacement components (in your case, the wood case).
DF-215-192297-636_8305.25
Unfortunately, I just don't recall what they all are...
DF-215-192297-636_8305.26
there's a way to word the description that works and doesn't get you slapped for "keyword spamming" (which is what putting Marshall in the descriptive text will earn you).
DF-215-192297-636_8305.27
Fun stuff, eh?
DF-215-192297-636_8305.28
That sounds right...
DF-215-192297-636_8305.29
as long as it doesn't fall into the NOT ALLOWED category by meeting this criteria:
DF-215-192297-636_8305.30
Using "compatible with," "fits," or "for" before a brand name in the title of your listing to describe items that are universally compatible or that are compatible with an entire product class
DF-215-192297-636_8305.31
Just know if it is someone that is "after you" (which sometimes happens) - there is ALWAYS some violation that you are breaking or you are near the questionable portion of breaking some policy.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.32
Because eBay will usually "pull first ask later" when a listing is reported, your listings will only become better and you may just sell more because of what you learn on how to become a better seller as you refine your listings.
DF-215-192297-636_8305.33
If you keep a good sense of humor and communicate with eBay... eBay will start "ask first pull later".
DF-225-195986-848_5143.1
Hello,
DF-225-195986-848_5143.2
I wonder if someone can clear something up for me?
DF-225-195986-848_5143.3
I have a £63,950 SVR mortgage with Halifax with 19 1/2 years left. (it's currently £64,570 due to some stupidity a few yrs ago).
DF-225-195986-848_5143.4
Now, this was originally taken out as interest only but when I've phoned a couple of years ago to increase the payment they have changed it to "part interest, part repayment". Not too fussed about this as I've worked out the numbers and the correct amount is coming off the capital every month.
DF-225-195986-848_5143.5
I'm going to contact Halifax for details on how to make overpayments as I've increased my direct debit again but would like to be able to make ad-hoc overpayments when I'm able to.
DF-225-195986-848_5143.6
Thing I'm curious about is the 10% overpayment thing - I know my mortgage agreement is subject to this however what does it really mean? Should I only be paying 10% more than my interest only payments or is it 10% extra off the capital? My new direct debit (as of end Dec 12 would take me over the 10% of IO payments).

I'm guessing they will give me a rough idea of how much I can overpay in £s based on my current direct debit but would be interested to know beforehand just for my knowledge.
DF-225-195986-848_5143.8
Currently Halifax have on their records that "Pensions" will be paying the capital off at the end of the term - these are currently non existent so trying to get myself at least on track for repayment at the end of term.
DF-225-195986-848_5143.9
Thanks very much!
DF-225-195986-848_5143.10
its 10% of the mortgage balance for the year, so if your mortgage balance in £100,000 that year you can overpay by £10,000 during the course of the year without penalty.
DF-225-195986-848_5143.11
However, if you are on the SVR you dont have the 10% limit, just overpay as much as you can comfortably afford
DF-225-195986-848_5143.12

Are you sure you're on SVR? Or just a rate that is soon to end?
DF-225-195986-848_5143.14
Having worked for Halifax it is indeed correct that once you've reached the SVR then no overpayment limits are enforced you are simply free to overpay as much as you wish to.
DF-225-195986-848_5143.15
This is correct. Your KFI/Mortgage Offer may say something along the lines of 'in any one year you may repay up to 10% of the amount outstanding on your special rate product'. It's a rolling 12 months, so the year starts when you make your 1st overpayment. So, you couldn't pay £10k in december and another £10k in january for instance, you'd need to wait 12 months.
DF-225-195986-848_5143.16
Then, once your 'special rate product' ends, you go onto SVR, with no overpayment restrictions.

Hi, I'm in the middle of a divorce and am trying to take on the mortgage on the family home.
DF-225-195986-848_5176.2
I'm only trying to borrow about 16% of my home's current market value, which is about twice my annual income.
DF-225-195986-848_5176.3
Have approached several big lenders and tried going through a financial adviser, but noone will lend because my income is made up of: 4 very part-time jobs (2 employed, 2 self-employed), maintenance (not yet Court ordered) and tax credits.
DF-225-195986-848_5176.4
Their argument is that once my daughter leaves school some of these income sources will cease, but by then I would hope to be back at work full time (she's only 7!).
DF-225-195986-848_5176.5
The mortgage rates I've been quoted are less than I'm paying at the moment anyway!
DF-225-195986-848_5176.6
It's been suggested to me that I try and take out a personal loan instead?
DF-225-195986-848_5176.7
Anyone got any suggestions?
DF-225-195986-848_5176.8
You would think that having 4 part time jobs that at least you will have 2 at any one time and that is more secure than having 1 full time job and possibly being given notice to leave.
DF-225-195986-848_5176.9
It sounds like you are self employed and will need the assistance of an accountant to create some books that show some decent profit combining all the sources of income streams as one source of income.
DF-225-195986-848_5176.10
They may be doing an affordability calculation instead of a income multiple and don't think you can afford to pay for day to day living expenses and a mortgage.
DF-225-195986-848_5176.11
I would get another financial advisor who can help you.
DF-225-195986-848_5176.12
Someone should be able to lend you the money.
DF-225-195986-848_5296.1
Hi all, I currently have a mortgage which what used to be Northern Rock.
DF-225-195986-848_5296.2
I took the mortgage out in 2007, fixed rate for 5 years.
DF-225-195986-848_5296.3
This is due to finish in June.
DF-225-195986-848_5296.4
I don't know what to do!
DF-225-195986-848_5296.5
I took the mortgage out with my then husband, we split two years ago.
DF-225-195986-848_5296.6
He did all the money side of things so have no idea where to go.
DF-225-195986-848_5296.7
I have a funny feeling that since house prices have dropped, I am likely to be in negative equity.
DF-225-195986-848_5296.8
We borrowed more than 100%, retrospectively a stupid thing to do.
DF-225-195986-848_5296.9
I have taken the mortgage on on my own.
DF-225-195986-848_5296.10
Any advice would be gratefully received, thank you.
DF-225-195986-848_5296.11
In rate terms, there's nothing you can do.
DF-225-195986-848_5296.12
If you are in negative equity as you seem to think, there is no prospect of another lender taking you on, so a remortgage isn't going to be possible.
DF-225-195986-848_5296.13
NRAM/UKAR which is the body managing your mortgage does not offer replacement or customer retention products, so your mortgage will revert to the follow-on rate set out in your original Key Facts Illustration (KFI) or mortgage offer.
DF-225-195986-848_5296.14
This is likely to be the standard variable rate, currently 4.79%.
DF-225-195986-849_0285.1
Given theat the current lending and borrowing siatuion, it is more difficult for people to get a Mortgage.
DF-225-195986-849_0285.2
I understand that Martgage broker is to be able to see from a lot of providers.
DF-225-195986-849_0285.3
But for people are dififcult to get mortgage today, is their advise is worthy...
DF-225-195986-849_0285.4
Say for instance they say it is better you ask for this provider but in fact, when you afollow their suggestion, you get rejected ?
DF-225-195986-849_0285.5
Is not that it is better to sticj to your bak who knows wel your financial stability and ability ??
DF-225-195986-849_0285.6
I undesratnd that some mortgage adviser are free of charge.
DF-225-195986-849_0285.7
I am asking here because once you get rejected it will seriously danage your credibility to get another lender ?
DF-225-195986-849_0285.8
Opinions and expereince from people in ths forum are really appreciated....
DF-225-195986-849_0285.9
First of all I disagree that its harder to get a mortgage...compared to the days of 100%+ mortgages yes but for the right applicants there is plenty of lending available.
DF-225-195986-849_0285.10
Obviously I am biased as I am an independant mortgage adviser but my view is it is good that we can source the whole market finding the best deals and knowing the specific lending criteria of each lender.
DF-225-195986-849_0285.11
I used to work for a bank and I would never offer my services to my friends and family as I didn't know whether there were better services elsewhere.

Banks will want you to think that you have a better chance of getting a mortgage with them as you have your finances with them but this is simply not true.
DF-225-195986-849_0285.14
If you get rejected you need to look into the reasons why...affordability..credit score etc

What is the likelyhood of us getting a mortgage to start off with and is going to be more difficult to find 100% one?
DF-225-195986-849_0460.6
Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks
DF-225-195986-849_0460.7
Whats the value of your house?,
DF-225-195986-849_0460.8
hows both your credit rating?
DF-225-195986-849_0460.9
This seems to be the 2most important factors when considering a mortgage other than your joint income.
DF-225-195986-849_0460.10
The chance of getting a 100% is probably impossible to be honest...
DF-225-195986-849_0460.11
A shared ownership property is one where you do not buy the property outright, but only a percentage share of the property. For example only 25%.
DF-225-195986-849_0460.12
However on the remaining 75% which is still owned by the housing association, you will pay a monthly rent.
DF-225-195986-849_0460.13
So if you are not looking at this types of properties, you will not get a 100% mortgage.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.1
Hello all - just joined and after some advice.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.2
I've seen the posts on the forum relating to the Nationwide consent to let and subsequent hike in interest rates by 1.5% (this is going back a year or two).
DF-225-195986-849_2659.3
At the time my wife and I were renting out our property and had signed up to a 5 year fixed rate mortgage.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.4
We initially lived in the property but subsequently let it out having received permission to do so from Nationwide.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.5
Given we were in a fixed rate mortgage and had paid for the extra security i was pretty shocked and appalled that they were forcing this increase on us.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.6
In any case my wife went to Nationwide to discuss our options with the mortgage adviser.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.7
The long and short of it is that the mortgage adviser gave the advice that given base rate was 0.5% and we could move to another lender on a formal BTL mortgage for a far lower rate (given with the 1.5% increase our Nationwide rate would be over 7%) and therefore over a the mortgage term more than cover the early repayment fee.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.8
This advice made perfect sense so we paid to come out of our fixed rate with Nationwide and moved to another lender - the early repayment fee was circa £3k.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.9
Subsequently we received the letter from Nationwide (as I am sure many did) saying that those on fixed rate mortgages that would have to pay early redemption fees would not have the 1.5% increase imposed until the end of the term of the fixed rate.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.10
Given the advice we received and subsequent redemption fee we paid (prior to Nationwide changing their minds) I wonder whether anyone thinks we have any recourse against Nationwide.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.11
Be very interested in any thoughts.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.12
Many thanks
DF-225-195986-849_2659.13
It definitely sounds interesting.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.14
I would certainly go to the branch, speak to someone in management and present this letter along with any documentary evidence that you may have had from your previous meeting.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.15
Also get them to produce the notes of your previous meeting with the mortgage adviser.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.16
we came within a gnats whisker of paying a 7k early redemption fee to avoid the 1.5% hike.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.17
thankfully the letter arrived a day before our completion date on our new mortgage so we were able to get out of it.
DF-225-195986-849_2659.18
only 15 months until we can leave nationwide and move over to a proper btl mortgage.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.1
Are there any bridging companies who'll do a loan for an uninhabitable property (it's derelict)?
DF-225-195986-849_3802.2
We need to borrow 55% of the hammer price until we can get planning permission for restoration which will allow us to get a mortgage
DF-225-195986-849_3802.3
(verbal approval of our plans has been given by the local planning officer and the building society in question).
DF-225-195986-849_3802.4
(Excuse me while I do a little - this is a building we nearly bought through normal channels 5 years ago, got gazumped on and never thought we'd ever get another crack at it!)
DF-225-195986-849_3802.5
It doesn't seem likely and would be horrendously expensive.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.6
Look at it from the lender's point of view:
DF-225-195986-849_3802.7
This is high risk - if you don't get planning approval the site could actually be worth a negative amount (due to demolition costs).
DF-225-195986-849_3802.8
Verbal approval is essentially worth nothing.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.9
On the flip side there is little return for the lender as you don't want the loan for long so not much time to charge interest.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.10
Really you would be better off: Getting a mortgage not a bridging loan (also difficult). Getting an unsecured loan to buy it initially.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.11
Be aware that almost no bank or building society will give a mortgage on a property after it has been bought, if it was bought less than 6 months ago.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.12
I don't know the answer to your question, but it sounds very risky to me.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.13
You will be taking on a costly short-term loan based only on verbal promises which may not eventually come good.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.14
What happens if the B Soc doesn't eventually make an offer, or it's at a much lesser amount than you hope for?
DF-225-195986-849_3802.15
Does it know that the house is uninhabitable - usually that makes a property unmortgeable.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.16
Or if the PP takes much longer to be considered because there are objections / it's refused and you have to appeal etc?
DF-225-195986-849_3802.17
Last time we got a thread like this, I suggested Tiuta and the OP did some research and found the cost was prohibitive.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.18
I echo the other comment about how you deal with being unable to remortgage if something goes wrong and would ask you to note you'll have to stick with the bridging finance for around eight months as you won't be able to apply for the remortgage until you've owned the property for six.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.19
Caution needed.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.20
Bridging is only possible where the lender believes you will live elsewhere.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.21
They cannot lend on a property you will be living in as this then falls into FSA regulation, which bridging is excluded from.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.22
An alternate to bridging is a non status mortgage, but the lender will still need to survey the property and carry out the nusual due dilligence to include full legal conveyancing and checks.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.23
The reason most aution deals are cash is that lending is NEVER guaranteed and can fall through at the mast moment, meaning the applicant looses the property and thier 10% deposit.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.24
You'll need a good deal of luck to get this through using lending.
DF-225-195986-849_3802.25
Also bridgers usualy want a clearly defined exit route, and it wont be sufficient to say a remortgage should be possible subject to all manner of property repairs (what if you fall ill / go mad / get depressed part way into the renovation for example).
DF-225-195986-849_5301.1
Hi all, current mortgage fixed deal ends in March and this will be the first time remortgaging.
DF-225-195986-849_5301.2
Purchased the property March 2009.
DF-225-195986-849_5301.3
The property was valued at £102000 when we purchased it and we now owe £77000.
DF-225-195986-849_5301.4
I am interested in learning more about how valuations work when remortgaging.
DF-225-195986-849_5301.5
Do they come round?
DF-225-195986-849_5301.6
Are there any ways I can improve the potential result?
DF-225-195986-849_5301.7
What happens?
DF-225-195986-849_5301.8
Nothing much has changed since last valuation in or out the property.
DF-225-195986-849_5301.9
To be honest I would be happy with £102000 valuation but guess we will find out.
DF-225-195986-849_5301.10
Any information anyone can provide about this process would be great.
DF-225-195986-849_5301.11
Are you remortgaging to a new lender, or doing a product transfer with the current one?
DF-225-195986-849_5301.12
If it's the latter, chances are your current lender will use a desktop system called HomeTrack.
DF-225-195986-849_5301.13
If you are moving your mortgage to a new lender, it will normally ask a surveyor to visit the property to establish its value.
DF-225-195986-849_5301.14
As you are right on the 75% borderline for the better products, I would imagine an inspection would be better for you.
DF-225-195986-849_5301.15
Talk to your current lender before you start shopping around.
DF-225-195986-849_5609.1
It's been solved now.
DF-225-195986-849_5609.2

DF-225-195986-849_5896.1
Hi, I've a dilema!
DF-225-195986-849_5896.2
Looking to remortgage, and have found suitable product from Yorkshire Building Society. £195 non-refundable application fee, conveyancing and valuation free.
DF-225-195986-849_5896.3
It is a 75% LTV.
DF-225-195986-849_5896.4
My house is worth VERY close to the 75% mark.
DF-225-195986-849_5896.5
If I apply, and the valuation comes out lower, I'd have to pick the next best product, which is actually Santander.
DF-225-195986-849_5896.6
Santander valued for free at £180000, which is the amount we estimated it to be.
DF-225-195986-849_5896.7
Mortgage balance is £134000, so as you can see, very close to the 75%.
DF-225-195986-849_5896.8
I could just go with Santander,
DF-225-195986-849_5896.9
no fees, but would cost me additional £1700 over the 3 year fixed term.
DF-225-195986-849_5896.10
Do I risk losing the £195?
DF-225-195986-849_5896.11
I suppose only I can answer that, but any thoughts or tips?
DF-225-195986-849_5896.12
You appear to have done the maths and identified the pitfalls.
DF-225-195986-849_5896.13
If there's no way of avoiding that fee, you appear to have to risk it.
DF-225-195986-849_5896.14
Isn't there a product with no fees you could choose upto 75% so you'd lose nothing if the property is downvalued?
DF-225-195986-849_5896.15
Lenders I have spoken to say that while their valuation fee is 'free', you still have to pay for it but it is refunded if you go ahead.
DF-225-195986-849_5896.16
I guess it's not always the case (only spoke to 2 lenders, and perhaps I only discussed it with one of them).
DF-225-195986-849_5896.17
It's one of the reasons why I'm not remortgaging at the moment - found a great 80% rate but could go the wrong way of the house is valued lower than expected.
DF-225-195986-849_5896.18
Just to also say, YBS are quite strict on affordability too not just LTV,
DF-225-195986-849_5896.19
their online affordability calculator is quite close.
DF-225-195986-849_5896.20
Santander are not as strict.
DF-225-195986-849_6697.1
Good evening people,
DF-225-195986-849_6697.2
Was looking for a little advise in regards to the possible mis-selling by a mortgage broker of a 100% intrest only mortgage.
DF-225-195986-849_6697.3
My partner signed up for a 100% intrest only mortgage with the Nothern Rock mortgage but to realise it was a intrest only mortgage some 5 years down the line.
DF-225-195986-849_6697.4
The reason I feel that may have a case to be answered is that surely mortgage company must take some precautions when selling an intrest only mortgage
DF-225-195986-849_6697.5
i.e the customer must take out some sort of endowment to ensure that when the mortgage intrest is finally paid off then the customer would be in a financial position to pay of the actual amount the mortgage was agreed for???
DF-225-195986-849_6697.6
The mortgage broker who advised obviously has a case to answer but are nothern rock in the wrong aswell?
DF-225-195986-849_6697.7
Any information that can be offered would be greatly appreciated.
DF-225-195986-849_6697.8
No, there is not.
DF-225-195986-849_6697.9
Read the paperwork she got when she took out the mortgage - it will explain that you need to set up a repayment vehicle for the capital amount.
DF-225-195986-849_6697.10
I would also be amazed if the broker did not also advise her of this.
DF-225-195986-849_6697.11
Unfortunately this was quite a common problem, particularly with young first time buyers who have no real clue about mortgages.
DF-225-195986-849_6697.12
This was a problem during the boom years in that banks were not checking if customers had a repayment vehicle in place, hence they were throwing these interest only mortgages at people because that's all they could afford because house prices were so high.
DF-225-195986-849_6697.13
There are people on here who will deny this ever took place.
DF-225-195986-849_6697.14
Many people put a lot of faith in some of these brokers in the belief that they were acting in their best interests.

Unfortunately there is probably little come back because ultimately your partner should have read closely what she was getting into before she signed.

Some stocks have had a great run since early March
DF-225-195989-879_3877.3
is it time to cash in and wait for the next drop or have we bottomed and its a steady rise from here?

I would like to here from anyone who saw the last recession, late eighties,pan out and how the sectors reacted.
DF-225-195989-879_3877.5
I viewed charts from then,
DF-225-195989-879_3877.6
it shows volatility till '92 before a general steady rise although different sectors behaved differently

I think we'll be rangebound for quite a few years.
DF-225-195989-879_3877.10
Except there is a good chance that commodities and commodity stocks will spike violently upwards for a while in a year or so (higher than they were in 2008), thanks to supply destruction which may well have a coiled spring effect.
DF-225-195989-879_3877.11
Also inflation and a falling dollar should help them go up as well..
DF-225-195989-879_3877.12
There is also good reason to believe that commodities will rise over the long terma s well.

Have 2 kids and wonder if i could put money in children accounts for better tax free interest or do you have any suggestions please?

Thanks in advance for any help
DF-225-195989-879_9165.7
Based on what you have said, you should not invest but stick to savings.
DF-225-195989-879_9165.8
Check out the usual tables on this site for interest rates.
DF-225-195989-879_9165.9
If you put money into the name of your child it becomes his beneficially.
DF-225-195989-879_9165.10
In any case see http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/tdsi/children.htm for tax treatment of interest on money given to children by parents.
DF-225-195989-879_9165.11
You could always hold the cash in an on-line account (AA paying 3.2% gross) until April
DF-225-195989-879_9165.12
then each of you can put £5640 into a cash ISA?
DF-225-195989-880_0167.1
Hi An elderly relative (late 80s lives in annex adjoining the house) has banked with lloyds all her life - and she asked me for some general advice.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.2
I wasnt at all familiar with her financial situation and she has in the past been advised by Lloyds.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.3
What appears to be the case is that she has: £150k+ in an OEIC/shares ISA with Scottish Widows £30k in easy access savings account paying 2% with lloyds £15k in current account with Lloyds £5k in cash ISA with lloyds
DF-225-195989-880_0167.4
What struck me was that she has all her savings in Lloyds/Scottish Widows so well over the £85k protection limit.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.5
Also that she had been advised to put so much in OEIC/corporate bonds/shares ISAs as it appears her capital has been fluctuating (generally down).
DF-225-195989-880_0167.6
She invested this whilst in her 80s so am struggling to see how it would be good advice to ask her to put so much in a scheme where capital is not protected.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.7
Anyhow we have booked an appointment next week to go through this with me in support.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.8
Do others think this advice is strange ?
DF-225-195989-880_0167.9
And what would others advise.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.10
My instinct is to get her into good savings accounts where capital is not at risk and to split it across 3 different institutions (it seems you can can get 3%+ if you keep an eye on the rates being offered), plus make sure she uses all the ISA allowance each year
DF-225-195989-880_0167.11
Any thoughts/commented would be appreciated ? David
DF-225-195989-880_0167.12
I'd be reluctant to start messing with an elderly relative's finances.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.13
Others in the family might accuse you of all sorts when she dies.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.14
That said: 1) If she's of sound mind you need to understand if she's prepared to move from LTSB or not.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.15
Another bank may confuse her significantly.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.16
2) If she wants to stay with LTSB, support her in finding the best home for her money from their range, but also help her to keep it in a good paying account, as most of their accounts have 12 month bonuses.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.17
3) Make sure you don't do anything with cash ISA that could impact her stocks and shares ISA.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.18
4) Get her agreement to shift money from the current account to a better savings account (even if it's only the 2% one).
DF-225-195989-880_0167.19
Just because somebody's old doesn't mean that capital should be protected.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.20
My biggest concern for her would be if she owns a property.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.21
There's a high chance of an IHT bill on the horizon.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.22
I'd be talking to an IFA about the best ways to mitigate this.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.23
As dunstonh suggests, the shares will effectively be in her name and aren't relevant to the protection scheme.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.24
This is a very tough one.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.25
Banks generally will do what's best for them which is invariably bad for the customers.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.26
There is a lot of evidence these are some of the worst routes to market due to them often having the highest costs.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.27
As mentioned though, change is never fun, especially when it could be confusing and misunderstood.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.28
I would personally say she should find an IFA and pay upfront for advice (ie no commissions) so she gets what is most suitable for her.
DF-225-195989-880_0167.29
Given her age it's standard practice to have less money in equity and more in guaranteed income than she currently appears to have due to short term fluctuations.

I'm probably going to get criticized for what I'm about to write, but as a long time lurker on these forums I know that I can also expect some sensible and honest opinions.

I have been having a relationship with a married man for some time now and I'm starting to get fed up with the situation and wonder if this is all it's ever going to be.
DF-225-196010-966_3137.3
How likely is it that a married man would leave his wife for the 'other woman', How do I know if he's serious about me or just toying with me?
DF-225-196010-966_3137.4
I know he does love me, but that's not always enough is it?
DF-225-196010-966_3137.5
I am really torn at the moment whether to let things carry on, or to walk away.
DF-225-196010-966_3137.6
Likelihood of him leaving his wife for you, slim to none.
DF-225-196010-966_3137.7
Even if he does could you live your life happily?
DF-225-196010-966_3137.8
If he can do it to his wife, would he have qualms about doing it to his girlfriend?
DF-225-196010-966_3137.9
1. The person you are having the affair with is cheating on his wife.
DF-225-196010-966_3137.10
If he does it once, he could do it again - remember the old saying "when a man marries his mistress, it leaves a vacancy - for the next mistress".
DF-225-196010-966_3137.11
2. Quite simply, he is cheating, you are cheating.
DF-225-196010-966_3137.12
There are all the excuses in the world "he will leave when the children are older/when his wife is better/when they've sorted out finances - just waiting for the right time to tell her" blah, blah blah, blah!
DF-225-196010-966_3137.13
If you have any integrety, you would walk away now.

He's having his cake and eating it at the moment?

Why would he want to give that up?

hi, i am getting married on february 18th 2012 and i am planning on buying a gift for my wife to be.
DF-225-196010-966_3771.2
She loves tiffany and i bought her the chunky link bracelet with heart in the first few months that we were together so now i am thinking to get her the necklace.
DF-225-196010-966_3771.3
Is the official tiffany Uk website the only place to buy official and not fake items or are there other places that sell tiffany?
DF-225-196010-966_3771.4
plus anyone else have any other similar ideas??
DF-225-196010-966_3771.5
looked at links of london and pandora but I'm not sure....
DF-225-196010-966_3771.6
Sounds lovely.
DF-225-196010-966_3771.7
The only place to buy genuine Tiffany is the website or Tiffany shops.
DF-225-196010-966_3771.8
The only place to get Tiffany cheaper is the airport shops abroad, if the exchange rate/ duty free combination works in your favour.
DF-225-196010-966_3771.9
Having the matching necklace is a lovely idea.
DF-225-196010-966_3771.10
If she likes charms you could get the Links sweetie bracelet - then you have the next few presents sorted out for the charms.

OH came home from work on Monday evening by taxi and found 3 men trying to break into the house.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.2
They set upon him, knocked him to the floor and kicked him several times in head and stomach, stole his mobile phone and bag and ran off.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.3
The police came out very quickly, did a drive around with OH and the cabby but didn't see them that night.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.4
They took DH's bag (which they found dumped a few streets away) and said they would forensically test it, and there was a CCTV camera which covered the area and the cabby said he could definitely identify the men as he got a clear view.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.5
DH has not been asked to give a statement, and we assume nor has the cabby.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.6
He got a letter in the post this morning, dated Tuesday, saying the police were closing their investigation.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.7
The detective in charge hasn't answered phone calls and his bag hasn't been returned to him, which contained business papers and clothes.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.8
DH did need treatment at A and E after the attack
DF-225-196010-966_4222.9
It seems pretty clear that the police did not bother with forensic testing and may not even have checked the CCTV footage .
DF-225-196010-966_4222.10
Is there anything which can be done to challenge their decision not even to do a preliminary investigation into an attempted burglary and common assault, where there are witnesses to the attack?
DF-225-196010-966_4222.11
If it is relevant at all, DH has no previous convictions, arrests or anything similar with the police, and is a middle aged businessman set upon by 20 year old males of a different racial background to us.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.12
no, something is wrong here.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.13
They can't just 'close an investigation' the day afterwards, not having even taken statements.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.14
I'd say get some legal advice, or write to the Police, stating what you've put in your post above and ask for an explanation.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.15
you could try posting this on the moneysaving in marriage and relationships board?
DF-225-196010-966_4222.16
you might get more answers there.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.17
I would get down to the police station sooner than just writing a letter.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.18
If CCTV needs to be examined and has not yet been looked at, you want it seized asap, before it is recorded over.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.19
It is of course possible that the CCTV wasn't working on the day in question but I am still surprised no other forensic examinations have taken place.
DF-225-196010-966_4222.20
If a full note of your OH's / the cabby's evidence was taken in a police notebook then the need for an immediate witness statement is reduced.

Hi All I am looking for advice please.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.2
DD1 is in futher education -
DF-225-196010-966_5003.3
because the course she wanted to do isn't available near us she is in residential college and we pay her accommodation and food costs,
DF-225-196010-966_5003.4
it leaves things very tight, but as we felt this was a great opportunity for her we were prepared to do it.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.5
She also has the use of a car as its easier (and a lot cheaper) than us driving her back and forth most weeks.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.6
DD2 is due to leave school next summer and is hoping to start a hairdressing apprenticeship.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.7
She started to talk about driving lessons (a bit premature I know) and us buying a car and paying for petrol and insurance.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.8
I mentioned to her that as she will be earning an income it will be time for her to start paying us towards her keep, etc.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.9
She thinks that will be very unfair as we are still paying for her older sister.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.10
Any suggestions please - we are prepared to take the money and put it away for her future (although I wouldn't admit that to her as she would want it sooner rather than later).
DF-225-196010-966_5003.11
I do see her point, but am not prepared to let her get away with not paying anything.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.12
Thanks for reading.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.13
Does her sister earn any money?
DF-225-196010-966_5003.14
If she doesn't, then you could speak to them both about the contributions you expect from them when they both start earning.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.15
As for the car - Did you pay for DD1s lessons?
DF-225-196010-966_5003.16
It seems unfair to not pay for DD2s if you did, and then to allow access to the car.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.17
I don't see why she would expect her own car if her sister shares yours, although you will have to think about priorities for who needs the car and what you will do if both want the car!
DF-225-196010-966_5003.18
Letting her get away without paying anything won't teach her anything for the future, but equally if she does't get the same treatment as her sister she'll probably feel quite upset.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.19
My grandaughter is in the final year of 3 of a hairdressing course,
DF-225-196010-966_5003.20
she has to work part-time in a salon but doesn't earn very much and the stuff she has had to buy/keep replacing for the course has been very expensive.. so my daughter has had to help her by not actually taking any keep money as long as she is on the course..
DF-225-196010-966_5003.21
its meant my grandaughter has managed to pay for all her own clothes, fares, lunches, and going out money over the course..
DF-225-196010-966_5003.22
my daughter was happy that she'd found something she wanted to do and was able to near enough support herself through it..
DF-225-196010-966_5003.23
as I said at the beginning as an apprentice she will be earning peanuts..
DF-225-196010-966_5003.24
I agree with what is being said TW.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.25
To support DD1 to the tune that you are and then to expect DD2 to pay into the household on what I'm sure will be a much less than minimum wage apprenticeship seems like a double blow to DD2 to me! and I can appreciate her frustration.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.26
I do think that whilst DD2 is doing her apprenticeship she should be allowed to retain her wages.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.27
You should explain to her that this is your way of ensuring that they are both treated equally in what are very different circumstances.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.28
However I would also make clear that once either of them begin to earn a full time wage outside of college or apprenticeship that they will be expected to contribute to the house if they continue to live there!
DF-225-196010-966_5003.29
I wish you well.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.30
I'm sorry but I can see your DD2's point -
DF-225-196010-966_5003.31
you say you would support her if she went to college but even though you agree that the apprenticeship would be a better career choice you're prepared to penalise her for it.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.32
If she was leaving school to get a normal job I would agree she should contribute but this is basically her still studying, just going about it in a slightly less conventional way.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.33
Has she arranged to apply for this herself?
DF-225-196010-966_5003.34
That to me shows a lot of intitative and motivation for someone her age,
DF-225-196010-966_5003.35
rather then taking the more mainstream option of college she has looked into her options and gone for what will be best for her future career.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.36
Apprentice wages are extremely low so while she is on those could you maybe look at a compromise -
DF-225-196010-966_5003.37
eg you will still provide her room and board (the same as you are doing for her sister) but she has to pay all her expenses out of her wage, ie her travel to work, lunches there if she needs them, phone if she has it, any expenses she needs for work.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.38
hmmmmmm hard one here!
DF-225-196010-966_5003.39
Normally I would say yes, take a nominal amount from your DD2 as she is now "working", but as you are supporting DD1, I can see why she might be cheesed off.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.40
I guess it depends on how much she is earning during her first year as an apprentice......
DF-225-196010-966_5003.41
Lets say, for talks sake, it's £100 a week,
DF-225-196010-966_5003.42
that's still a lot of money for a school leaver who has no household expenses or food to pay.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.43
Personally I would take a small amount, say £20 a week from her and, as you said, put it in a savings account for if she does decide to go travelling in the future.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.44
Explain to here that it may not seem fair, but she is now earning, and the cost of this compared to living away from home, is minimal. Or show her a breakdown of what a 1/3 of all household cost would be.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.45
In regards to the car, does your DD1 really NEED one?
DF-225-196010-966_5003.46
Of course it is easier for her to get home at weekends, but can she not get the train / bus?
DF-225-196010-966_5003.47
When I was at uni, I think I could count the number of students who lived away from home and had a car on one hand - the rest mnade do with a young persons railcard.
DF-225-196010-966_5003.48
And will your DD2 NEED a car?
DF-225-196010-966_5003.49
If the answer if no, neither of them really need it then I would suggest that they share the car (1 month on / off, for example).
DF-225-196010-966_5003.50
A car for a teenager / student, is an expensive luxury and with the rising costs of insurance and fuel, most parents cannot this for one child, let alone 2.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.1
Gee I happened to notice while drinking my starbucks coffee at my cubicle that the House along with the Senate has passed an extension of the Patriot Act.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.2
I wonder what those democrats are up to passing a piece of legislation that a few short years ago they were decrying as an outrage against the constitution?
DF-228-194843-711_9397.3
I am sure they have very good reasons for doing it after all they ARE democrats.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.4
That's an easy one:
DF-228-194843-711_9397.5
Once those rights are taken away, it's pretty close to impossible in this conservative-media dominated world, to get them back.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.6
If there was ever an attack, the Right-wing nut cases would be SCREAMING, "IF ONLY they wouldn't have taken the Patriot act away!!!!
DF-228-194843-711_9397.7
NO attacks under "W!!" although that's a huge lie, we've been hit over 5,000 times because of the baby "W," that is if you consider US troops wasted in Iraq as American.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.8
Maybe this is your way of suggesting we need to get rid of the corporate/conservative media?
DF-228-194843-711_9397.9
Excellent idea!
DF-228-194843-711_9397.10
Democracy Now/Free Speech TV Uber Alles!!!
DF-228-194843-711_9397.11
The Democrats are cowards.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.12
They voted to extend the Patriot Act because they were afraid that the party of fear, i.e. Republicans, would use it against them politically.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.13
I do not excuse them for that, but I do understand it.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.14
The only principle either major party has now is basically self-preservation.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.15
It is sick, and really a very sad commentary on all of us and these times.

DF-228-194843-711_9397.17
Heh, both seem true at face value.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.18
Self-preservation needs to be eliminated from the priorities of our representatives.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.19
I think we should have clearly-defined and fairly short term limits for all elected officials.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.20

DF-228-194843-711_9397.21

DF-228-194843-711_9397.22
Johnny - I understand where you're coming from on public campaign financing, but I tend to resist such a program/policy on principle.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.23
It would have to be explained in great predictive detail for me to consider it, and even then I would be highly suspicious.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.24
Same goes for the recent SCOTUS ruling on corporate campaign cash - it is a big challenge to our political unity and progress, but when the issues are boiled down, I don't see anything wrong with it in principle.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.25
But, in practice, it's clearly a huge problem.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.26
Something else has to give.

I thought we were speaking in general terms.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.28
I know of many things that were built first out of necessity and fixed afterwards.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.29
I don't know for sure but expect one would find many laws we now consider cut and dried to be in that category.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.30
What I don't recall is anything, legal or otherwise, that was ever built right in its first incarnation.
DF-228-194843-711_9397.31
Everything I can think of needed to be fixed, tweaked, adjusted, or just plain done over after its creation and use brought unexpected knowledge to light.

DF-228-194843-711_9555.6
Back when I was unemployed and sought out private health insurance, as a single male I had to buy coverage that included pregnancy, go figure.
DF-228-194843-711_9642.1
The unemployment rate has changed again.
DF-228-194843-711_9642.2
It's up to 9.5%.
DF-228-194843-711_9642.3
It's risen from 7.6% in January.
DF-228-194843-711_9642.4
It's 16.5% if you take into account all the folks who've stopped looking or who are now doing part-time work.
DF-228-194843-711_9642.5
Remember when the left was bitching when it was 4.5% back in 2007?

Yep it really is hard to believe that businesses in this country haven't been creating jobs even after all the tax cuts they received from the Bush Administration.

It made McGoohan's death even more poignant, as you can imagine.

Rewatching has also reminded me how much it's both of and beyond its unmistakably 1960s origin.
DF-228-194843-711_9920.10

All 17 episodes of the original The Prisoner can be streamed at AMC's Web site.

Before "The Prisoner", McGoohan was secret agent John Drake in "Danger Man" ( aka, in the U.S., "Secret Agent").
DF-228-194843-711_9920.16
That show was, for its time (1962-68), sophisticated and realistic, compared to stuff like "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." and "The Saint" which frequently bordered on the goofy.
DF-228-194843-711_9920.17

The reason that "they can't admit" that it is a recession is because by definition, arbitrary as it may be, a recession is two quarters, usually successive, of negative growth as measured in real GDP.

Also, anyone notice the shots (on cnn at least) of Ted Kennedy's constant negative head shaking?
DF-228-194843-712_1190.4
But, I loved the spontaneous applause when dubya mentioned that portions of the patriot act would expire next year.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.5
He looked disgusted.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.6
I found it quite humorous.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.7
I slept through most of it last night, just read the transcript on Fox News.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.8
Talk about being absolutely devoid of anything meaningful.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.9
It does appear that the Boy George wants to keep on spending and spending and spending.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.10
Is he hoping to cash in on a bunch of new votes by dolling out $300 million to the approx. 600,000 prisoners to be released this year?
DF-228-194843-712_1190.11
Where the hell did this program come from?
DF-228-194843-712_1190.12
Why are we going to spend an assload of money on job training for newly released prisoners when we've already got a ton of non-law-breaking people out there who can't find jobs?
DF-228-194843-712_1190.13
That just doesn't make sense.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.14
Maybe he's just hoping to funnel them directly into those types of jobs where they'll now be able to make minimum wage, work 60+ hours a week, and get absolutely no overtime whatsoever.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.15
If the one plan is connected to the other, it's a master stroke of you-scratch-my-back brilliance in allegiance with his corporate pals.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.16
I gotta suggestion: Try decriminalizing marijuana, and our prison populations will fall off immediately, and in a huge way.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.17
You know, in the end, it's really us (the common, average citizens of this country) that are to blame for all this.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.18
We continue to allow ourselves to live within a political construct that is really just all smoke and mirrors.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.19
The only candidates we ever get to hear about are those that please huge corporate sponsors enough so that they give him the money and the press time needed in order to put on a dog and pony show, I mean campaign.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.20
So much to say about what's wrong with the so-called leadership of this country, so little time.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.21
I too enjoyed the spontaneous applause when dumbya mentioned the expiring unPatriot Act and his pissed off look.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.22
What I really want to know is how is it that when judges rule in favor of equal marriage rights for all citizens it is "imposing" their views on citizens?
DF-228-194843-712_1190.23
Please explain to me like I'm a 5 year old how it is that if I want to marry my partner it is imposing views on some Texas hick in the White House?
DF-228-194843-712_1190.24
Isn't it the other way around? Are not the 'christians' imposing their views on me?
DF-228-194843-712_1190.25
I found the last SOTU of Dumbyass to be the most hyperpartisan ever - large chunks of red meat for the hooting, drooling right-wingnuts in the room served with extra helpings of garbled syntax with treatments of the truth like it was silly putty and spinning the Iraq spin so strong he should have been wobbling like he was on one of his benders from his thirties.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.26
I found it pretty weird that he would take time to mention roids in sports - but not make one mention of Osama Bin Laden.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.27
There's a sign from the old west - dead or...whatever...
DF-228-194843-712_1190.28
How about this line:
DF-228-194843-712_1190.29
Happy early Father's Day, 41!
DF-228-194843-712_1190.30
How'd you like that slap across the face?
DF-228-194843-712_1190.31
A horrible, divisive disaster of a SOTU which will haunt this one-term failure all the way up to Election Day.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.32
He never was a uniter and last night proved it big time.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.33
Another observation that I don't think I've seen elsewhere:
DF-228-194843-712_1190.34
And that Stepford Democratic response was simply unwatchable.
DF-228-194843-712_1190.35
With leadership like this, we'll never be an effective opposition in Congress.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.1
So I had a bunch of old 8-mm home movies converted to disk.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.2
I was going to toss the old films, until I saw that eight of the were on metal spools in really nice metal canisters.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.3
What can I do with them?
DF-228-194844-712_4955.4
I don't want to just toss them into a landfill if they can be used by someone. Any ideas?
DF-228-194844-712_4955.5
High-quality film transfers is something I do for extra money.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.6
I previously worked for a local media company for whom I performed the same types of duties.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.7
Last Fall they got bought out, reorganized, and I ended up purchasing the equipment from the section I'd managed.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.8
I then set up a small business working out of my home (with a referral deal I negotiated through my previous employer).
DF-228-194844-712_4955.9
Many of my customers wonder the same question as you - what to do with the old films once they've been transferred to video.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.10
I usually recommended storing the films.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.11
I mean, if you've got the room (we're usually talking no more than a shoebox's worth), why not keep them around?
DF-228-194844-712_4955.12
For as good as the film to video transfer may be (and the peace of mind it provides), there's no substitute for watching the real thing.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.13
Film has such a unique look - the colors, the infinite depth, etc.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.14
Unless the films in question are going bad (do they smell like ammonia?) I say keep 'em and maybe buy yourself an inexpensive projector on eBay.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.15
Making it a special occasion by viewing them the way they were meant to be seen is much more romantic than just popping in a DVD.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.16
By the way, there's no reason to ever throw out originals ever ever ever unless you really don't care about them.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.17
Whatever format you're converting them to will be inferior to the original and to future formats.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.18
It's great to copy them as a back-up or to be able to more easily view them, of course, but don't toss them.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.19
I'm sure there are bazillions of people who regret disposing of old home movies in the 80s after transferring them to VHS, which degrades after a decade.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.20
Even CD-Rs and DVD-Rs degrade.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.21
Hard drives fail.
DF-228-194844-712_4955.22
Digital stuff needs to be backed-up and transferred from formats every few years.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.1
Don't think I've ever seen such a mild January in Madison as this year.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.2
Not that I mind. Normally we're perilously skating on icy sidewalks in below-zero wind chills this time of year.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.3
I know we'll eventually get hammered with a big snow fall -- this IS Wisconsin -- but it just feels odd.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.4
Not good for winter sports either.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.5
Hard to ice skate on water, ski when there's no snow, or ice fish when there's no ice!
DF-228-194844-712_5001.6
I love a good snowfall.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.7
In the meantime, however, I'm enjoying it while it lasts.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.8
I got to go golfing yesterday, so hell yes, keep that snow away.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.9
As for lower water tables, not so fast my friend.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.10
The amount of precipitation for December was a little ABOVE normal.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.11
However since the average temp was almost 7 degrees above normal, it mostly came down as liquid, or melted right away.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.12
So I think lake and river levels will be just fine.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.13
I'm tired of seeing joggers in short sleeves and shirts in January.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.14
It's not THAT warm.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.15
Bring on the cold, bring on the snow.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.16
Lots of it.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.17
It kills the bugs and bad critters, helps the farms, lakes and rivers.
DF-228-194844-712_5001.18
If you don't like Winter here, move South and see how things are there.
DF-228-194844-717_8786.1
So did anyone else catch the article in this past Sundays State Journal on tiles?
DF-228-194844-717_8786.2
I want to redo a small bathroom that is 5ft by 7ft (at most) and really loved the pictured fusioni ceramic reflective black/gold tiles.
DF-228-194844-717_8786.3
My question is, does anyone know if there are similar alternatives on the cheap?
DF-228-194844-717_8786.4
The current tiling of the room in question is 12 by 12.
DF-228-194844-717_8786.5
I have. We stayed within the footprint of what was there and I think that saved on costs more than anything else.
DF-228-194844-717_8786.6
We were able to do everything for less than $2,000.
DF-228-194844-717_8786.7
It did take longer than I expected, but that can happen even if you hire a contractor to do everything for you, so I would say it was worth it.
DF-228-194844-717_8786.8
I've lost motivation (and money) for this project.
DF-228-194844-717_8786.9
It's going to be until at least Spring before I even think about it again. But it's still something I would really like to do!
DF-228-194844-717_8786.10
I tell ya, what I'd really like to do is push the wall out a couple feet and put in a bath/shower, but I'm not that handy or daring.
DF-228-194844-717_8786.11
How much do you think something like that would run?
DF-231-195128-750_0051.1
New season starts tonight, with a rematch of the Saints-Vikings NFC championship game.
DF-231-195128-750_0051.2
Think this will be a feisty kick-off, as all the talk from Minnesota after the game was about the treatment dished out to Favre during the game -
DF-231-195128-750_0051.3
think you'll see a few cheap shots on Brees in this one.
DF-231-195128-750_0051.4
And if the Saints come after Favre again, will his ankle hold up?
DF-231-195128-750_0051.5
Criminally for a Bears fan, i'm struggling to see past the Packers winning the NFC this year.
DF-231-195128-750_0051.6
The AFC is a lot more difficult to predict - will the Colts suffer the SuperBowl losers hangover that's afflicted most teams who lost the game?
DF-231-195128-750_0051.7
Will the Patriots contract issues impact their offence, and will Welker really be 100% after his season ending injury last year?
DF-231-195128-750_0051.8
Will the Jets back up their talk?
DF-231-195128-750_0051.9
I'm going out on a limb and predicting a really good season for Miami this year - can see them and the Ravens having a huge say in who will represent the AFC this year
DF-231-195128-750_0051.10
I'm looking forward to it.
DF-231-195128-750_0051.11
I don't get to watch as much as i'd like too.
DF-231-195128-750_0051.12
I'm a Jets fan, so hopefully we can back up our talk but it could heap too much pressure on them and crumple under it.
DF-231-195128-750_0051.13
As long as the defence stays as strong as it was they have a great chance and if Thomlinson can find his form again he could be a major asset.
DF-231-195128-750_0051.14
I've done my dream team but i'm not too confident!
DF-231-195128-750_0051.15
QB Carson Palmer (Cincinnati Bengals) RB Chris Johnson (Tennesse Titans) RB Ladainian Thomlinson (New York Jets) WR Vincent Jackson (San Diego Chargers) WR Steve Smith (New York Giants) TE Heath Miller (Pittsburgh Steelers) KR John Kasay (Carolina Panthers DF New York Yets
DF-231-195128-750_0051.16
Am going to try and get into this.
DF-231-195128-750_0051.17
Moved house recently and now have sky sports and have seen a few games and quite enjoy it.
DF-231-195128-750_0051.18
I'm almost to the the point were i understand the rules lol.
DF-231-195128-750_0051.19
Are the Patriots the best team? As on all the Madden's i have played they have the highest rating
DF-231-195128-750_0053.1
Former Welterweight foes Miguel Cotto and Antonio Margarito are all set to be squaring off in another Puerto Rico versus Mexico slugfest.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.2
Their last bout ended in an 11th round TKO in favour of Margarito, but as your probably well aware, the fall-out when it was discovered he was using 'loaded gloves' for the Mosley fight, cast a huge cloud of his epic win.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.3
Many Puerto Rican's believe this was why Cotto's face was so badly injured and that a normally tough fighter was systematically broken down.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.4
Cotto himself swore that he would never let Margarito earn another penny from his name, but another recent stoppage defeat to Manny Pacquiao and a move up in weight has left the Caguas resident with little routes left to big money purse fights.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.5
Perhaps this rematch has been too long overdue and that it has withered on the vine. But nonetheless fan's of either fighter (I'm a Cotto fan) will no doubt salivate as they make their ring walk.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.6
So many variables will come into play as to whom is the victor.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.7
Will Cotto be weakened by the first loss mentally?
DF-231-195128-750_0053.8
or will he be more driven than ever given his hunger to upturn the result in his favour.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.9
Will Margarito look to prove himself 'cement free' against his old rival, in full knowledge that a loss to Cotto would effectively spell the end of him as a light-middleweight and possibly a marquee fighter.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.10
One thing's for sure, the MGM grand will be rammed come September 17th !
DF-231-195128-750_0053.11
No one watch the Pacman/Mosley fight?
DF-231-195128-750_0053.12
Awful fight with Pacman blaming Mosley for his style as the reason.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.13
In my opinion Mosley had little or no chance to beat him but his gameplan was the only one that could possibly give him the win.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.14
Pacquiao did look off his game though.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.15
Whereas previously I was undecided over the outcome of a fight with Mayweather on last nights showing, and as long as Mayweather was on his absolute A game, I would say my money would be on Mayweather.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.16
Saying that though I still cannot see that fight happening.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.17
The Vazquez/Arce fight was BRILLIANT though.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.18
As a side note I thought the intro's were amazing and nice to hear that Bob Arum had stated that he had looked as other forms of promotion such as UFC and learnt from it.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.19
I'd love to see Haye win, I don't like the guy but he's British and for that reason I'd like to see him do us proud.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.20
The K brothers have had far too long on top of the heavyweight division and have not brought anything exciting to the division.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.21
I like Haye because he's fresh and quite exciting.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.22
Haven't posted over here for a while...
DF-231-195128-750_0053.23
Did anyone see Mike Perez win the prizefighter heavyweights?
DF-231-195128-750_0053.24
I have to say I'm quite impressed with what I saw, if he sticks at it he'll be a champ in the next few years.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.25
So, Groves v DeGale this coming weekend(although it's the undercard for Cleverly v Braehmer, I'm more looking forward to it, should be a good nights boxing though!), going to be away for the evening so will have to just pray I can get a stream working as have been anticipating this one for a long time!
DF-231-195128-750_0053.26
My brain says DeGale, but my heart and hopes defiantely are willing for Groves. Must admit I think people are writing Groves off way too much since the Anderson fight, and I think and hope it will be a good fight all round(with Groves knocking DeGale out, right after some DeGale showboating , can but hope ).
DF-231-195128-750_0053.27
Seems Froch may be interested in taking on the winner, although personally I think he'd have way too much for either of them at this stage of their careers.
DF-231-195128-750_0053.28
Good time for boxing at the moment
DF-231-195128-750_0109.1
Yes its that time again best cycling event of the year and its the 100th year starts on the sat'day 2nd july
DF-231-195128-750_0109.2
We all know it was a 2 way battle last year with Andy Schleck and Alberto Contador i though andy should of attacked more last year but losing his brother frank to a bad injury in the early stage of the tour he was missed.
DF-231-195128-750_0109.3
Is Alberto Contador racing the tour this year we don't know and i don't care i think there is a few that are in with a chance
DF-231-195128-750_0109.4
Bradly wiggins has to be the worsed tactician ever and his trainning went wrong for the tour last year but he has changed his conditioning and training for this season and i really fancy him if he gets the support of the team sky at 25/1 its worth the punt
DF-231-195128-750_0109.5
Am not going to go on but here are a few others i fancy for the tour
DF-231-195128-750_0109.6
Andy schlek guy is just a monster and will prob win it 11/4
DF-231-195128-750_0109.7
Robert Gesink young gun has great talent with each way bet 33/1
DF-231-195128-750_0109.8
Samuel Sanchez its his last year here really has to attack and the best going down hill at silly speeds 33/1
DF-231-195128-750_0109.9
Jurgen Van Den Broeck each way punt for top 3 40/1
DF-231-195128-750_0109.10
As for Alberto Contador i dont like cheats winning he should not of been in the tour last year never mind this year
DF-231-195128-750_0109.11
he get the results back after the tour is finished like 3 weeks after of his drug abuse in meat.
DF-231-195128-750_0109.12
I'm a big fan
DF-231-195128-750_0109.13
Have watched the tour for over 20 years, not realy been a fan of the Contador era though, ould have liked to have seen him up against the likes of Armstrong, Indurain, Le Mond etc in their prime.
DF-231-195128-750_0109.14
I honestly don't think Contador has real competition, Schlek's form doesn't look all that this year and even when it has been he has never been able to leave Contador on a mountain.
DF-231-195128-750_0109.15
Would really like to see Wiggins give him a go, he will always gain time on the time trials but cannot match Contador or the likes of Sanchez on the slopes.
DF-231-195128-750_0109.16
Let's hope Contador eats a dodgy kebab or something if not he will win quite easily again in my opinion
DF-231-195128-750_0109.17
Still really looking forward to it, some great racing and that wonderful French scenery
DF-231-195128-750_0109.18
I watched quite a bit of coverage of this on EuroSport last year, remember the Schleck / Contador rivalry.
DF-231-195128-750_0109.19
Didn't Schlecks chain come off on one of the hill climb stages near the end which cost him dearly!
DF-231-195128-750_0109.20
I remember there being some kind of controversy between him and Contador, some unsportsmanlike conduct
DF-231-195128-750_0109.21
Will deffo be keeping a keen eye on this again, as I've really got into cycling myself over the past 3 years.
DF-231-195128-750_0109.22
When does it all kick off again?
DF-231-195128-750_0109.23
After Wimbledon yeah?
DF-231-195128-750_0109.24
I am looking forward to it - cant wait in fact. After the Giro Contador looks in form depending whether the Giro took it out of him.
DF-231-195128-750_0109.25
Hopefully both Schleck's will make it round this time had that been the case last year the end result might have been different as last year should have been Andy Schleck's year but it was not to be.
DF-231-195128-750_0109.26
Let's hope this year is as close, but with a few more contendors.
DF-231-195128-750_0109.27
Contador has stated that he felt off it last year, if that was the case then Schleck and the others will need to be seriously in form this year.
DF-231-195128-750_0109.28
I think the first stage is great this year with no prologue so any one of the rider's could be in yellow after the first day rather than one of a few.

Also looking forward to seeing what the manx missile can do this year.
DF-231-195128-750_0109.30
The Champs-Elysees finish last year with Cav in the background winning was up there with most amazing cycling things i have seen, along with Lance on the Alpe Duez 2001 (The look), Lance going past Ulrich in the TT, most of Pantani's climbs holding down on the bottom bars and most of what Cancellara does
DF-231-195128-750_0109.31
Also 100 years of the the Galibier which is being climbed twice with one side for the first time ever, i love the climbing stages, the two stand out stages for (and i am going to book time off work to watch them) are stage 18 with the mountain finish at Galibier and the next day just 109km but with the Alpe Duez finish with Galibier in the middle.
DF-231-195128-750_0109.32
As this is a short stage i really hope the climbers go on the attack early on I might also book stage 17 off as i think that these three stages are going to be critical for the Yellow assuming no incidents up to this point.

.....Of a British winner.
DF-231-195128-750_0119.2
Well our man just showed he has the correct minerals by coming back from a set down to beat Tsonga at the Aegon Championship.
DF-231-195128-750_0119.3
Gutsy performance really and similar to the ones recently at the French Open.
DF-231-195128-750_0119.4
Of course every year we wonder if he can do it and Mr Murray has managed to dash the hopes of the nation.
DF-231-195128-750_0119.5
I do however sense a grit about him that wasn't present before.
DF-231-195128-750_0119.6
Anyway, great match today.
DF-231-195128-750_0119.7
Well played Andy and JWT for that matter.
DF-231-195128-750_0119.8
Good luck next week.
DF-231-195128-750_0119.9
He'll obviously get the easiest draw out of the top 5....but will play too defensively and overuse his backhand slice...then get beaten by the first tricky opposition.
DF-231-195128-750_0119.10
That's just how it goes.
DF-231-195128-750_0119.11
Perhaps if the first big seed he plays gets knocked out before they're meant to meet he'll have a chance.
DF-231-195128-750_0119.12
In a word no unless Nadal, Federer and Djokovic are all drawn on the same side of the draw and the one that progresses goes out injured before Murray scrapes through his 5 setter on the other side of the draw
DF-231-195128-750_0455.1
Apparently, Franck has been with a prostitute who was under age.
DF-231-195128-750_0455.2
Blimey, I wonder how much he had to pay?
DF-231-195128-750_0455.3
I saw the other day that he was a witness, but now he's admitted to being involved!
DF-231-195128-750_0455.4
For the good of the game both the players clubs and national teams need to suspend them pending further investigations, as that is exactly what would happen to you and I in our jobs.
DF-231-195128-750_0455.5
They need to set an example, and maybe even FIFA should ban them from the World Cup as it's doesn't give football a good name!
DF-231-195128-750_0566.1
Who else agrees that Wales' win over Scotland was absolutely AWESOME?
DF-231-195128-750_0566.2
Those Welsh fans who left the stadium earlier cos they thought Wales were gonna lose must be KICKING themselves!
DF-231-195128-750_0566.3
Still dosen't look good for wales.
DF-231-195128-750_0566.4
Played two lost one,and needed a miracle to beat scotland .
DF-231-195128-750_0566.5
I bet they cant wait to play ireland and france
DF-231-195128-750_0566.6
reminded me of twickenham two yrs ago when England should of won but Wales pulled one out of the fire.
DF-231-195128-750_0566.7
Well done to the leaks but the sweaties must kicking themselves after playing so well in the first half.
DF-231-195128-750_0566.8
As for Ireland, well the French were unplayable
DF-231-195128-750_0705.1
liverpool hit 6 past hull
DF-231-195128-750_0705.2
Tottenham hit 5 past burnley
DF-231-195128-750_0705.3
Torres and keane both with hat-tricks keane going 1 better for tottenham
DF-231-195128-750_0705.4
Wigan knock 3 past chelsea
DF-231-195128-750_0705.5
Utd Hit 2 past Stoke
DF-231-195128-750_0705.6
Not to bad a day was it on the goal front
DF-231-195128-750_0705.7
The number of goals today is no surprise, it has been a familiar theme through the season thus far.
DF-231-195128-750_0705.8
Arsenal put 6 past Everton, ManU put 5 past Wigan, the 7 goal Manchester Derby etc.
DF-231-195128-750_0705.9
The lack of draws is weird though.
DF-231-195128-750_0705.10
Are defences just worse this year or have the top teams in particular just got better at opening up teams who park the bus?
DF-231-195128-750_0705.11
Or are they just taking more of their chances.
DF-231-195128-750_0705.12
Weird that high scoring is the theme of the season so far, last season if I remember everyone was amazed by 5-19th being separated by 3 points or so after 8 games (might be an exaggeration but I cannot be bothered to look).
DF-231-195128-750_0705.13
I know which one I prefer!
DF-231-195128-750_1022.1
Just watching SSN and its almost become laughable the uncanny timing of injuries coming up to international friendlies.
DF-231-195128-750_1022.2
Is it time to scrap them as the players don't seem to care too much these days?
DF-231-195128-750_1022.3
England are going to Berlin to play the old enemy Germany.
DF-231-195128-750_1022.4
You'd think that these players would relish this chance to represent their country in this game (its hardly Andorra is it?).
DF-231-195128-750_1022.5
But the list of injuries is just too silly to be true.
DF-231-195128-750_1022.6
OK so some may have real injuries but lets be honest, the law of averages would not have so many top players injured at the same time.
DF-231-195128-750_1022.7
I think managers are also substituting players near the end of EPL games so that they can say they were injured.
DF-231-195128-750_1022.8
Rooney, Terry, Ferdinand, Gerrard. I'm sure we will see plenty of imaginary injuries over the next day or two.
DF-231-195128-750_1022.9
i dont understand it
DF-231-195128-750_1022.10
why should players have to play in friendlies?
DF-231-195128-750_1022.11
surely friendlies should be for the england manager to test out future england players?
DF-231-195128-750_1022.12
if there is a risk to any of the big names (even if its a paper cut) why should they play?
DF-231-195128-750_1022.13
or why should they be forced to play?
DF-231-195128-750_1022.14
Guess that's why we won't win anything.
DF-231-195128-750_1022.15
I don't understand why they wouldn't want to play against a big team, even if it is a friendly
DF-231-195128-750_1022.16
Players can get injured at any time anyway, it should still be their duty to play when they are told to.
DF-231-195128-750_1022.17
How players from different clubs are expected to bond when they don't even play a match with each other is beyond me!
DF-231-195128-750_1022.18
To be honest, I get very bored of England friendlies these days,
DF-231-195128-750_1022.19
I look forward to it, then by half time, I am normally just back at the PC with it on in the background :/
DF-231-195128-750_1030.1
I dont have Setanta Sports and they are showing this on saturday night at 11pm onwards.
DF-231-195128-750_1030.2
Fighting at Madison Square Garden, New York it should be a decent fight to watch for those with the channel.
DF-231-195128-750_1030.3
how can anyone get excited over this fight between joe hide from all good fighters untill there to old to fight and roy you called it too old to fight.
DF-231-195128-750_1030.4
this fight is to make money not the sport of boxing.
DF-231-195128-750_1452.1
So after the charity match yesterday it was Mr Beckham that announced the resignation of the LA's manager....
DF-231-195128-750_1452.2
unusual to say the least..
DF-231-195128-750_1452.3
its usually a club spokesman or the chairman etc that make these announcments.
DF-231-195128-750_1452.4
Now with the manager gone, there is talk of Beckham maybe coming back to the premiership on a loan deal....
DF-231-195128-750_1452.5
but who would he go to if he did?
DF-231-195128-750_1452.6
would you like to see him at your club?
DF-231-195128-750_1452.7
As an experienced (and talented) player, I'd like to see him come to Spurs on loan.
DF-231-195128-750_1452.8
Sadly though, the media hype he brings with him would only put us under even more media pressure and we have enough problems at the moment.
DF-231-195128-750_1452.9
His best days are behind him, and, let's be honest here, he went to the US to have an easy coast to retirement.
DF-231-195128-750_1452.10
He knows, and all credit to him for it, that he isn't up for top flight football in Europe anymore.
DF-231-195128-750_1452.11
I realise of course that this is heresy, but hey, the truth normally is.............
DF-231-195128-750_1645.1
Another good start for England.
DF-231-195128-750_1645.2
It would be good if the West Indies can make a good game of it this time.
DF-231-195128-750_1645.3
I don't read papers.
DF-231-195128-750_1645.4
What did Vaughan allegedly say about Flintoff that caused a bit of a stir?
DF-231-195128-750_1645.5
Something about calling him 'Fredalo' i.e. Pedalo I believe.
DF-231-195128-750_1645.6
Only overheard a conversation about it though!
DF-231-195128-750_1645.7
He said that the Fredalo incident caused problems with team spirit that were contributory factors in our poor World Cup performance.
DF-231-195128-750_1645.8
I must admit that I don't have a great deal of interest in the current Test Match as West Indies were a weak team before being deprived of their captain through injury and they seem to have packed their team with medium pace trundlers that make Paul Collingwood seem fast.
DF-231-195128-750_1645.9
Off on a tangent I quite like all of the Sky commentary team with the exception of David Gower who I think is dreadful.
DF-231-195128-750_1645.10
He is very boring and will never use a simple word if there is a longer one available but worst of all - he witters.
DF-231-195128-750_1645.11
He has a tone that just invites me to fall asleep instead of listening what he has to say.
DF-231-195128-750_1645.12
He was trying to make a point this morning about Stauss's batting technique and droned on and on going round and round in circles until I gave up trying to follow what he was saying.
DF-231-195128-750_1645.13
Michael Atherton is a superb commentator as he is articulate, amusing and very knowledgeable and I wish that they would make him the front man and pension off Mr Gower.
DF-231-195128-750_1812.1
UEFA need to sort out italian football and i'm sorry but one Valencia player has ruined there season.
DF-231-195128-750_1812.2
I have never seen anything like this in european football.
DF-231-195128-750_1812.3
If it where an english game or a english team where involed you can garruntee we would have been banned from all european torunaments for a few years.
DF-231-195128-750_1812.4
Well it is a given that if it was an English team, there would be bans.
DF-231-195128-750_1812.5
A few weeks after the Italians are told to look to England, the French blame the English even though on the face of it, it was their fault
DF-231-195128-750_1812.6
The Valencia reserve goalkeeper was an absolute disgrace
DF-231-195128-750_1812.7
did anyone see the camera in the tunnel?
DF-231-195128-750_1812.8
one of the inter players kicked down the valencia dressing room door, absolute carnage down there too
DF-231-195128-750_1825.1
Does anyone know why the Blackburn game tonight is such an early kickoff time ?
DF-231-195128-750_1825.2
I know the UEFA Cup is different from the CL, TV scheduling wise, as the CL in most instances has a 7:45pm GMT kick off time (presumably the best median for all of Europe).
DF-231-195128-750_1825.3
I always thought the early evening kick off for the UEFA Cup was either for TV (so they can have 2 live games back to back) or alcohol?
DF-231-195128-750_1825.4
Caught a bit about this on Talksport this morning - app its down to the German TV company who have the tv rights of the game and want it shown at around 7.00pm german time.
DF-231-195128-750_1825.5
I think they also mentioned that the tickets will be dirt cheap not sure it this is all part of the deal or just Blackburns policy for this game.
DF-231-195128-750_1825.6
Good luck tonight anyway.
DF-231-195128-750_1825.7
Is Liverpool's future striker playing?
DF-231-195128-750_1825.8
He's in the squad and it seems his strike partner has "severe toothache", so he may well get a game.
DF-231-195128-750_1825.9
Only 40 min to kick off, so we'll find out soon enough
DF-231-195128-750_1917.1
Hoping that there is no upset today and I get to see an entertaining game of football.
DF-231-195128-750_1917.2
Embarrassing seing what level they have sunk to if you can remember the Forest of the late 70/early 80's.
DF-231-195128-750_1917.3
Well the same players are 200% better now than there were under Megson so he must have been doing something really wrong !
DF-231-195128-750_1917.4
When I remember back to the good old days of beating Celtic, knocking Liverpool out of the European Cup (inthe days when it was a proper cup!) and winning back to back European Cups I just get depressed about the current situation
DF-231-195128-750_1917.5
Those great old Wednesday night European matches stood in the Trent End are still a great memory to have though
DF-231-195128-750_1971.1
After another deluge of Spin the Prem has now reached a quarter way through.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.2
It's no surprise then that Waddle chosen now to voice what many have felt for years - the Prem is dull as dishwater.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.3
What's also interesting is that someones been telling porkys.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.4
People have claimed that attendances have been up, up, up in the prem!
DF-231-195128-750_1971.5
But the figures shown in that article clearly show they are in fact going down - year on year!
DF-231-195128-750_1971.6
Only this season has seen a rise, and that is soley due to Utd and Arsenal increasing their capacity.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.7
Some teams have seen their attendances slashed over a four year period.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.8
I have to say Waddle is only confirming what many have been saying for a while.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.9
Bar two or three clubs the premiership is predictable, full of workmanlike teams, and heavily overpriced for what's on offer.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.10
Still, you don't have to be a genius to work that out!
DF-231-195128-750_1971.11
What's worse is that once again, those priceless prats at the FA continue to hide behind stats rather than facts.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.12
The two are not the same.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.13
I notice, Don, sorry Dan Johnson carefully forgets to mention that the figures for the top flight were rising rapidly year on year before the premiership was formed.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.14
All that happened was an upward trend continued into the prem era.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.15
Still, as long as they stick their heads in the sand they won't have to do anything about the situation will they?
DF-231-195128-750_1971.16
Just as they didn't in the 80's, and it was left to the fans to save the game from itself.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.17
The FA, more dangerous to the game than 30,000 NF footie thugs on the rampage.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.18
Not denying the FAPL is predictable, and we need more teams like Kevin Keegan used to manage.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.19
TBH I don't think its ever been that exciting
DF-231-195128-750_1971.20
But I think the article fails to mention other factors that would affect attendances, ie. Entrance Prices......
DF-231-195128-750_1971.21
some teams think its just an excuse to extort money out of the fan......
DF-231-195128-750_1971.22
e.g. Why would wigan increase their prices when they are never more than 2 thirds fulls?
DF-231-195128-750_1971.23
Surely they would earn more money by cutting prices and filling the ground?
DF-231-195128-750_1971.24
Also $ky have flooded TV with football, it is on constantly with at least 5 matches on at a weekend, and football every night with European matches.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.25
And finally whatever happened to the 3pm Saturday kick off?
DF-231-195128-750_1971.26
Our attendance has steadily dropped over the last few years.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.27
Last season we only managed a couple of full attendances.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.28
I don't know what it's like in other area's of the country, but in the Boro more and more boozers are showing every Boro PL game live.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.29
It's unbelieveable how many show foreign TV stations.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.30
I thought this was illegal.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.31
Lots of fans now, are taking a few pints in the pub, over going to the game.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.32
I honestly think this has cost the Boro 1000-2000 per game.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.33
When has it ever been any different???
DF-231-195128-750_1971.34
I support my team - Spurs - and that's the only team I'll ever really care about.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.35
It's the only team that has the capacity to send me into the depths of despair (all too often for my liking), or run around screaming and shouting with joy.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.36
No matter how pretty Ronaldo looks when skipping over the ball a dozen times, it'll never make me feel the same way as when Lee Young Pyo tries one of his pathetic step-overs and nearly falls over the ball.
DF-231-195128-750_1971.37
The Premiership is boring?
DF-231-195128-750_1971.38
Sorry, but ALL football is boring unless my beloved Spurs are playing!

Saw an old Mercedes estate that looked even bigger than the old Volvo... 4 cylinder engine which seemed ambitious but I guess it's frugal on petrol so it's ok?
DF-231-195129-748_8274.8
Don't mind spending less and then junking car after a year or two....

Stop searching on 200,000+ mileage
DF-231-195129-748_8274.11
most cars with that mileage will be rare and possibly worth something
DF-231-195129-748_8274.12
Scrap metal prices mean you can sell a 12 year old car with 150,000 miles that is unroadworthy and not running for £100 just for the metal.
DF-231-195129-748_8274.13
It's made a complete mess of the bottom end of the market.
DF-231-195129-748_8274.14
There are loads of sub £1000, sub 100K cars out there:
DF-231-195129-748_8274.15
It all depends what you are looking for.
DF-231-195129-748_8274.16
And also don't forget that a good fair few could be clocked and actually might have more mileage if you don't look for the signs or plug a laptop in.
DF-231-195129-748_8274.17
I would also make certain to include say upto £1,500 in your searches and haggle hard.
DF-231-195129-748_8274.18
Lots of people have unrealistic expectations, and if they don't want to come down you just walk away.

There are no Mondeos under ten years old for less than $4,500, mostly over $5,000. (Roughly $2/£1)
DF-231-195129-748_8274.22
The only two I could find less than that were wrecks.
DF-231-195129-748_8274.23
One was $2,000 with 270,000kms, a blown head gasket and in need of a replacement water pump.
DF-231-195129-748_8274.24
The other was $2,500 and looked fine until you got to the rear photos and saw that half the boot had been ripped off in a crash.
DF-231-195129-748_8274.25
God knows what other nasties are hiding under that one.
DF-231-195129-748_8274.26
Blown head gasket would be scrap value, ripped back end should be a write off.
DF-231-195129-748_8274.27
There was an older Mondeo ST24, which could at least be a bit interesting but it had 300,000km and was listed at $3,000.
DF-231-195129-748_8274.28
So off I sauntered to Pistonheads to find that barely any of the older Mondeos are over £1,000! And not many are over about 70,000 miles.
DF-231-195129-748_8274.29
The few cars under $2,000 here are old pooheaps known as Corollas.
DF-231-195129-748_8274.30
I'm trying to find an old banger run-around but want something at least vaguely interesting.

After threats of being discontinued, London bus lanes will be permenantly available to motorcycles
DF-231-195129-748_8429.2
Predictably the cyclist lobby claimed, despite the evidence, bicyclists would be dying in droves because of this decision
DF-231-195129-748_8429.3
I'm happy to give bicycles room, and the only dangerous near-misses are when a Lycra lout goes to overtake a Borris biker without checking if anythings coming up from behind.
DF-231-195129-748_8429.4
I don't think it will be to popular tbh.
DF-231-195129-748_8429.5
We already get free (no congestion charge) into London as it is.
DF-231-195129-748_8429.6
It will probably **** off the Car drivers even more.

Some peeps just gonna hate.
DF-231-195129-748_8429.8
If there isn't a Bus Lane it's not like we sit in many queues of Traffic as it is
DF-231-195129-748_8429.9
It's nice though and good to see someone using their intelligence for once.
DF-231-195129-748_8429.10
Most car driving plebs on the road do not even understand how bus lanes work anyway!
DF-231-195129-748_8429.11
They slavishly avoid them, even outside the hours of operation which really bugs me, as it causes unnecessary congestion.
DF-231-195129-748_8429.12
Mind you, I can't complain because it gives me unhindered progress, although a little hairy at times when wally in front decides to turn left accross me.
DF-231-195129-748_8429.13
The main bus lane I often use is free of traffic most of the day, even though its hours of use are only 730-930am.
DF-231-195129-748_8429.14
I cruise down it unhindered, apart from the odd parked car that forces a move-out.
DF-231-195129-748_8429.15
I stick rigidly to the limit, and if they're moving slower then I pass cautiously under rule 163.
DF-231-195129-748_8429.16
Using good anticipation of the numerous traffic lights I often sail past dozens of them sometimes as I maintain speed through good judgement and they're all stopped.

Now, i need to finace this.
DF-231-195129-748_9328.4
How do you get finance?
DF-231-195129-748_9328.5
Do you go to the dealer, agree a price, shake hands and they organise it.
DF-231-195129-748_9328.6
Or, do i go to a 3rd party and let them finance it?
DF-231-195129-748_9328.7
I have a mortgage and good earnings so i am not too concerned about getting finance just now!
DF-231-195129-748_9328.8
My current car i will be keeping (Merc 220 cdi auto sport estate), but i bought this for cash, so this will be my first finance deal!
DF-231-195129-748_9328.9
My last 2 car finance deals have loaded the first payments with interest, because they can only charge you a maximum of one months interest now if you settle early it pays for them to make you pay of more interest over the first year or two.
DF-231-195129-748_9328.10
I cant find the article but even with an unsecured loan if you have other finance with the same provider like a mortgage they can choose to come after your house/assets if you default on the loan.
DF-231-195129-748_9328.11
ps. I'm not against any type of loan, i found the above surprising myself.

Arguably Libya is a different matter entirely and it would be unconscionable to watch Gaddafi slaughter his own people, but it would be inappropriate and infeasible for Britain to go it alone
DF-231-195133-729_2014.12
Germany seems quite lukewarm to the idea of military intervention in contrast to the noises coming from Sarkozy and Cameron, so that is a deadlock then.
DF-231-195133-729_2014.13
David Cameron should just sit down and shut up, without a realistic cabability he has no real right to hog the limelight calling for a miltary intervention he has no possibility of deploying.
DF-231-195133-729_2014.14
Until we can actually make any difference and re take our place as a serious military power we should just duck out.

The Government proposal is to cap benefits to any one family at £26,000 net.
DF-231-195133-729_2125.2
This is equivalent to a working person earning £35,000.
DF-231-195133-729_2125.3
I don't see how any fair minded person can possibly object to the cap at this level; many working people would love to earn that amount.
DF-231-195133-729_2125.4
Why is it therefore that some handwringing Bishops and lefty lords are trying to wreck the bill by insisting that Child Benefit should be paid in addition to the cap ?
DF-231-195133-729_2125.5
Should the taxpayer fork out unlimited benefits to feckless irresponsible parents to have as many children as they want ?
DF-231-195133-729_2125.6
I think most people support the idea of a benefit cap and would be happy if it was lower than £26,000.
DF-231-195133-729_2125.7
The problem is having to also be happy with the idea of families with lots of children being very poor or living in very overcrowded conditions.
DF-231-195133-729_2125.8
Because the cap is per household and inclusive of rent.
DF-231-195133-729_2125.9
I can see the argument that £26,000 for say a family of six or eight is not going to be enough to both have a large enough home to not be very overcrowded and have enough money to pay the utility bills and eat.
DF-231-195133-729_2125.10
In the town where I live people in that unfortunate situation would end up living in very overcrowded three bed homes, so they could afford to pay utility bills and eat.
DF-231-195133-729_2125.11
I think I can live with that.
DF-231-195133-729_2125.12
But I can see why others might not be willing to.
DF-231-195133-729_2614.1
Too little, too late to make much of a dent in the huge costs of these schemes, but I see that the Unions are already threatening strike action...
DF-231-195133-729_2614.2
I think the perception is that PS workers are paying quite a heavy price for mismangement which has resulted in the cuts being so severe, in such a short space of time, rather than a gradual change.
DF-231-195133-729_2614.3
Don't think a political argument will hold much water, especially considering that this mismanagement has been going on for a long time.
DF-231-195133-729_2614.4
No one really wants to strike and lose even more money, however it really is the only "weapon" that a lot of workers have, however ineffective it may be.
DF-231-195133-729_2614.5
We have taken a 2 year pay freeze and will pay more for less in pension contributions.
DF-231-195133-729_2614.6
OK'ish so far, but when there are billions being spent on Government outsourcing projects, that actually cost more and provide a less effecient delivery to our clients, customers, charges etc, the continuing deployment of the armed forces which has become unsustainable, especially in regard to a country in debt up to eyeballs.

I know you are going to rip me apart Sidicks, but what a way to go
DF-231-195133-729_2800.1
A good decision by the Government
DF-231-195133-729_2800.2
Trident is by far the best and most efficient nuclear option.
DF-231-195133-729_2800.3
Ultimately it is also the safest and a cheap (all things considered) solution.
DF-231-195133-729_2800.4
The decision to commit to the purchase of the PWR3 Reactor and structural steel for construction of the new boats effectively commits the taxpayer to the renewal which, IMHO, is a good thing.
DF-231-195133-729_2800.5
Naturally the Lib Dems are insisting we save them face by wasting taxpayers money on a study of alternate options.
DF-231-195133-729_2800.6
Given by the time the study reports the Government will have signed a £3bn contract for the above items you really have to asked how many people are going to fooled by such a pointless exercise?
DF-231-195133-729_2800.7
Are Lib Dems supporters really than dim?
DF-231-195133-729_2800.8
Is that just the obligatory gesture to involve the Lib Dems, given they have always been very loud about Trident but very short on actual substance in stating what they would do?
DF-231-195133-729_2800.9
I like the the title of this thread - Trident Renewal Is Given Green light.
DF-231-195133-729_2800.10
Perfectly pitched!
DF-231-195133-729_2800.11
In purely defence terms it would have to be Trident as, whichever way you cut it, carriers are about expeditionary warfare.
DF-231-195133-729_2800.12
This said if you factor in conventional Defence of remote locations such as the Falklands, where a Carrier provides the ultimate guarantee of success should the runway there fall, the situation becomes greyer.
DF-231-195133-729_2800.13
Furthermore if you subscribe to the view that engagement overseas - such as in Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq - is linked with defence of our way of life here in the UK, then I would say both are about equal.
DF-231-195133-729_2800.14
Hopefully that choice would never come up anyway - there are plenty of other options for cutting first - not least removal of the 20,000 British soliders awaiting a Russian invasion in Germany.
DF-231-195133-729_2800.15
This cutback alone will fund Trident, Carrier Strike (both ship's and two tranches of F35C), Nimrod replacement and retention of Sentinal.
DF-231-195133-729_2800.16

Sorry - this is a few days old - but it seems that Education Secretary Michael Gove has suggested the possibility of the introduction of a compulsory modern foreign language at GCSE.
DF-231-195133-729_3142.2
As our involvement in the EU deepens, it is only right and proper that we equip our children with the language skills of the central European powers - French, German and Spanish.
DF-231-195133-729_3142.3
The latter in particular is important as it is becoming a dominant world language.
DF-231-195133-729_3142.4
And if we wish to remain a world trader, again it seems prudent to have language skills widely taught.
DF-231-195133-729_3142.5
I would also welcome making language training compulsory at college and degree levels - but one step at a time.
DF-231-195133-729_3142.6
To be honest, if we could just focus on teaching kids these days of just learning English properly, that would be a start!
DF-231-195133-729_3142.7
I took French in my GCSE, and can't remember any of it.
DF-231-195133-729_3142.8
And it hasn't hindered me in the slightest.
DF-231-195133-729_3142.9
In fact I've NEVER even needed to use it at all.
DF-231-195133-729_3142.10
I thought the aim of the current government was to reduce the prescriptive element of education, not increase it?
DF-231-195133-729_3142.11
Kids are taught to read and write by the end of primary school, those that can't by that stage should be given extra help anyway, so English should be optional at secondary school.
DF-231-195133-729_3142.12
Kids should be taught proper mental arithmetic by the end of primary school as well and should receive further compulsory maths until about the age of 14.
DF-231-195133-729_3142.13
IMO the only subject that should be compulsory to the age of 16 is science.
DF-231-195133-729_3437.1
Now I am a fan of the Post Office in the sense I believe the service they (should!) offer is invaluable, however, when I read this article I thought why are they investing in "intelligent stamps" and not improving the service they offer.
DF-231-195133-729_3437.2
Another thing why do the post office not offer self service points either in branches or Supermarkets.
DF-231-195133-729_3437.3
I mentioned this to a friend and they said they were sure they had seen this in Edinburgh or Glasgow - I must confess if they do offer this service then I have never seen it or advertised in their TV adverts and if they do why is it not more widely avaialble.... {and breath}
DF-231-195133-729_3437.4
Erh, how is the stamp intelligent?
DF-231-195133-729_3437.5
It looks like it's just a picture that the smart phone app knows is associated with a particular website, or have I missed something?
DF-231-195133-729_3437.6
The stamp in question is one of a commemorative set.
DF-231-195133-729_3437.7
Commemorative stamps are these days produced as much for stamp collectors as for putting on letters.
DF-231-195133-729_3437.8
Gimmicky stamps of this type are done for several reasons:
DF-231-195133-729_3437.9
(1) as a prestige thing to show how much more interesting and innovative a particular postal service is than its rivals
DF-231-195133-729_3437.10
(2) to attract more collectors
DF-231-195133-729_3437.11
I presume that, being sensible person, you're not into stamp collecting, but over the past few years, different postal services have introduced microprinting, scratch and sniff stamps, heat sensitive stamps, scented stamps, woven stamps (honestly!), metal foil stamps, etc, etc.
DF-231-195133-729_3437.12
This is actually quite a sane gimmick in comparison.
DF-231-195133-729_3437.13
It has very little connection with the ordinary postal service.
DF-231-195133-729_3437.14
This sort of stamp is these days pretty much the preserve of the philatelic rather than genuine daily use side of things.
DF-231-195133-729_3437.15
However, if anything, it should in the long run improve the service, because extra profits from increased sales of the stamp will find their way back into Royal Mail.
DF-231-195133-729_3437.16
Incidentally, stamp collectors of the old school tend to dislike these stamps because they are clearly intended for collecting rather than genuine use.
DF-231-195133-729_3437.17
This sort of collector would love to see a much smaller number of stamp issues and evidence that the stamps are genuinely used on letters rather than just bought by collectors.
DF-231-195133-729_3437.18
I think they have a point.
DF-231-195133-729_3437.19
Hey man whatever floats your boat and if it keeps you out of trouble then you wire in with your stamp collecting.

But this evening I have won something for 99p that is way too cheap.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.5
The item retails for £50 new and is an electronics piece of hardware (am not saying what it is incase the seller reads this forum).
DF-231-195137-745_4214.6
I have a deepdown feeling the seller is going to refuse this sale.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.7
Or come back with "its broken while packing up so cannot sell it" type response.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.8
And really I cannot fault him as I would do the same.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.9
Another part of me is thinking if he does this to come back with a how about I pay more for it.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.10
I have already paid for the item but when doing it I felt I was wasting my time doing it.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.11
To clarify I was really wanting this electronics hardware but refused to pay £50 as its not worth £50.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.12
I would say more so £30 at the absolute most.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.13
I looked on ebay just as a laugh thinking nobody would be selling it.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.14
But one person was with 6 days to go.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.15
I bid a high bid for it to make sure I got it and waited expecting as usual to be outbid in the last seconds by those fools buying second hand stuff for more than you can get it brand new (why do they do that!)
DF-231-195137-745_4214.16
And nobody else bid so it went for £1.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.17
Has anyone else got stuff cheap like this and the seller went through with it or not?
DF-231-195137-745_4214.18
And if the seller comes up with the excuse to refuse sale is there anything people can suggest as I want it.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.19
It is quite a rare electronics item (I doubt anyone else would be selling it for a good few months) and like I say £50 new.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.20
Well, the way eBay works, is that you can give him some pretty snotty Feedback if he decides, that although you won it fairly and squarely, he isn't going to complete the deal.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.21
But.......... He might very well give you some very bad Feedback back in return.

Had 20 watchers and sold for £1.20 plus £2.00 p and p....
DF-231-195137-745_4214.25
I thought he was a lucky buyer and sent it out!!
DF-231-195137-745_4214.26
He really should send it you with no complaint.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.27
He understood the risk of starting at a low price with no reserve and, presumably, is aware of e-bay terms and conditions.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.28
However, he may well do as you suggest.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.29
If so, personally I would contact him, explain you agree it went too cheap and that you understand his situation, that you really do want the item and come to an amicable agreement.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.30
Communication and a reasonable attitude tends to get you want you want, I find.

I gave them very nice feedback...

No-one has ever asked for more though.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.36
If he pulls out you can message him and ask what he would accept and he may be able to set up a new sale just for you.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.37
I don't know quite how it works but I have done this as a buyer.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.38
They may need to be a "shop" to do this.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.39
My brother just sold a 2nd hand office table for a quid yesterday.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.40
It was no use to him and would probably have gone to the tip if it hadn't sold.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.41
He was hoping for more but not really fussed it only sold for a quid.
DF-231-195137-745_4214.42
Does make you wonder if some people actually understand how Ebay works...
DF-232-195174-742_6353.1
... and it didn't work.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.2
This has been the final chapter of a long and sordid thing going on at my University, and this whole thing has been like a plot from a bad movie.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.3
First, some background:
DF-232-195174-742_6353.4
My University has had a long running battle, going back to 2006, with a council led by a man named Aaron Takhar that mismanaged and embezzled over $2 million dollars in student fees, treating the student association as their "personal piggy bank and private club house." as one student put it at the time.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.5
They were taken to court over it, and the judges filed in favour of the students, and ordered a new election and restitution to be paid, which was to be settled out of court by the University.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.6
All that needed to happen was for us to tally up the damages and get our money back.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.7
Takhar pulled delaying tactics, and the settlement has not happened.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.8
This is where poo poo starts to get absurd.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.9
A new coucil was elected this year in April, it was later revealed that a bunch of that elected body was related to Takhar, and his sister being put in charge of his legal case.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.10
Her first order of business was to halt all legal proceedings against her brother, suspending proceedings indefinitely.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.11
All the while, no one disclosing any conflict of interest.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.12
While Justine Franson, Aaron's sister, would resign over the allegations, no one else related would do so.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.13
The group would go on to raise their own pay (something they're not legally allowed to do) while cutting funding to clubs and other departments, host a party costing $125,000, spend over $250,000 on legal fees to sue people for speaking out against them, using private security to bar students from entering open meetings, and ultimately dismiss the case against Takhar..
DF-232-195174-742_6353.14
I sat in on the meeting where they raised their salaries, and the attitudes of the council as they did this was astonishing.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.15
The President of the executive body openly started threatening and intimidating people who were calling them on their bullshit.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.16
It was absurd.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.17
President "You got a problem with what we're doing?!"
DF-232-195174-742_6353.18
(He liked to change his name in all of the letters he wrote)
DF-232-195174-742_6353.19
Part of the problem with this council is that they had elected many of their friends into office as well, so they had a majority vote on everything that they did.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.20
There was a dedicated group of people who tried to slow down and block everything they could, but they had no power because there was only 4 of them against the 12 people pulling these shenanigans.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.21
That small group did everything they could, eventually calling a special general meeting, which required a petition to be signed by at least 250 students to even get the meeting to go ahead.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.22
This isn't really all that easy, as our school has just shy of 20,000 students spread over 4 campuses each at least 30 minutes away from eachother.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.23
Plus, you have to find 250 students who even pay attention to the student council, and give enough of a poo poo to do something about it.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.24
Our school has not had a successful special general meeting in over a decade.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.25
The current council was counting on this situation as student involvement is always low.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.26
Fortunately for us, the actions of this council were starting to get around, and people were starting to get pissed about it.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.27
The media had already started to pick up the story, and while it didn't get a lot of traction publicly, the people on campus started to notice.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.28
So, the petition was signed and the meeting was scheduled for November the 30th.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.29
Immediately the council reacted, trying to mislead people going to the vote.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.30
They refused to put up notifications of the meeting (something they're required to do as per their jobs), they pulled down notices that were put up, they even created another "special general meeting" the week after to try and confuse those trying to show up.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.31
Then they played the race card.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.32
Purely by coincidence, all of the members of the council that were up for removal were of South Asian descent.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.33
They hit up the media claiming that the other council members that were trying to get rid of them were just a bunch of racists (they were mostly white), and that they wanted them all out because they were South Asian, not because they were corrupt.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.34
Not surprisingly, this didn't gain any traction, as most of the people that wanted to kick them out were South Asian as well.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.35
The vote day comes, lots of students are leaving classes early to go vote, and others are going with them as teachers let some students go.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.36
Close to 450 people show up to register to vote, and the mood of the crowd is not favourable to the council.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.37
Things are already looking tense, there's a large group of south asian men close to the door to come in shouting at the crowd, calling them racists, the soon to be ousted council members are standing amongst them.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.38
The council members also hired thier own private security, the same security that they hired to bar students from attending meetings, because they felt threatened.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.39
This was all done on the student association dollar of course.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.40
This was when poo poo went down.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.41
I was in the room off the main hallway getting signed into the meeting when someone shouts out from the hallway "Security! Security! They're pepperspraying us!"
DF-232-195174-742_6353.42
Everyone stops and stares at the door, confused, not even knowing if this is real.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.43
Someone shrieks out "Security! Help! We're being pepper sprayed!"
DF-232-195174-742_6353.44
Everyone starts to react, but just as that happens, the fire alarm goes off.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.45
Lights and sirens start wailing and all the doors close.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.46
By this time, I had been ushered into the Gym where the meeting was taking place.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.47
We had reached the needed 250 students to meet quorum for the meeting at this point, and they started to get people to leave.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.48
This is important, if we had not gotten quorum, the meeting would have been cancelled, rather than delayed (some weird societies act ruling makes this so, I don't understand it well enough).
DF-232-195174-742_6353.49
Everyone is evacuated for about an hour as the Fire department and police show up to clear the building.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.50
There's wild speculation as to whether the fire alarm was a ploy to cancel the meeting, and that coupled with the pepper spray galvanized the crowd even more to want to kick these assholes out.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.51
We're eventually let back in, and the voting commences.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.52
It's all official in proceedings, so there's votes on how to vote, how to speak, etc.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.53
It's a little long, and there's lots of questions because people don't understand how these meetings work.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.54
Ultimately, it gets down to the vote.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.55
Seconds before we call the vote to kick them out of power, the fire alarm goes off again.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.56
This time, the fire department and police who stuck around were wise to the shenanigans going on, and we were only kept out for a few minutes.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.57
It was clear at this point that the council was going to pull every dirty little trick to try and stay in power as much as they could.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.58
A few students organized a group to watch all the fire alarms in the building at this point, because we were starting to get tired of this poo poo.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.59
Finally, we get back in the meeting, and the vote is immediately cast, and they're out.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.60
We then vote to find them all in bad standing, even Aaron Takhar and his associates from back in 2006.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.61
This means they can no longer vote for, or take part in any Student Association events or processes.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.62
This doesn't affect them academically and they can remain as students, but they're otherwise barred from pretty much any other involvement.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.63
You would think that this was the end of it, but you'd be wrong.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.64
Later that night, the ousted council members started passing a petition around the Library to overturn the vote.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.65
Something they're, again, not allowed to do as you can't solicit in the Library.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.66
Security has them removed from the Library.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.67
Later, they make a scene in front of their old offices, which they're not allowed access to anymore, as they want to retrieve their personal belongings and resort to shouting about it and making a scene.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.68
Security escorts them one at a time to get their things.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.69
I ended up in a meeting with the new council, as they were being briefed by the campus representatives, and it was revealed during that meeting that the ousted council had been using funds to lease property off site in secret.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.70
No one knew what the office was for, or what was there, and it hasn't been released yet.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.71
The next day, the old council make another scene trying to get into their old offices, claiming that the vote was illegal and not binding, and that they were going to their offices to work as if nothing happened.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.72
The campus security and representatives then handed them letters and escorted them off campus.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.73
To date, this is the situation as I know it.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.74
Hopefully it's the end of this whole sordid affair, but there's a good chance the exiled student body will try and take this up in court and try and get their jobs back, but it probably won't happen.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.75
The new student body is busy trying to get a new election started and work with the school to go over the accounting to try and track down where any other money or resources have gone.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.76
Plus, they need to get to work reopening the case against Aaron Takhar, and probably filing many new charges against the disgraced council.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.77
Here's a video showing things as they're going down.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.78
The camera man wasn't there for a lot of crucial moments, but it gives you an idea of the whole situation.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.79
That is some serious drama right here.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.80
How did the corrupt dude's sister manage to get elected president when her brother was under investigation for stealing council funds?
DF-232-195174-742_6353.81
Edit: I can sympathies as I'm still paying emergency dues to pay back CUPE national over funds that our local university union "lost".
DF-232-195174-742_6353.82
Do you suspect they have ties to organized crime outside the university itself?
DF-232-195174-742_6353.83
Frankly, the level of organization and commitment they've shown, and the fact that they didn't fail miserably before, plus all the members up for removal being from the same ethnic background (what do you mean by South Asian, anyway?
DF-232-195174-742_6353.84
Is that the Indian subcontinent, Indonesia, what?) makes me think they're a bit more than greedy student politicians.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.85
For that matter, if they were pepper-spraying people, why on Earth are they not in jail?
DF-232-195174-742_6353.86
If a scene was already being made, why did no one think to record it on their phones?
DF-232-195174-742_6353.87
Fantastic read.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.88
Thanks for the summary and citations, OP.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.89
It's all so absurd, the levels these people went through to remain "in office" are astounding, please update us if you hear anything about the off-site facilities.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.90
I hate Kwantlen.

I have to admit I was almost rooting for the bad guys there cause they were so ballsy.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.98
Are ya'll going to be able to sue them for damages and get that 2 million back?
DF-232-195174-742_6353.99
Wow... my student council basically just organised booze ups in the union bar.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.100
And in their eyes they were robbed of the things they were entitled to by bad people.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.101
They likely think they are the victims.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.102
So, call me clueless, but... student councils can approve loans, adjust policy, hire security, draw a salary, and get their own offices?
DF-232-195174-742_6353.103
Was the level of power held by the now-former council members a fairly standard thing in the world of higher education?
DF-232-195174-742_6353.104
I always thought of it as just another 'hell yeah this looks great on paper' poli-sci circlejerk.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.105
Blech, sad to hear about this.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.106
The worst I heard about our Student Union President where I went to University was him flying out first class on the Student Union dime and staying at some 4 star hotel.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.107
I couldn't believe the amount I, and every other student, was shelling out per semester so he could do that.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.108
You take the cake though, good to hear they finally got kicked out and hopefully they'll be criminally charged for those shady proceedings.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.109
Man I knew Kwantlen was hosed but this is pretty hilarious.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.110
I hope KSA doesn't pull a UVSS and spiral deeper and deeper into debt while the members of the board of directors fling poo poo at each other and blame everyone but themselves for their gross mismanagement.

BC student politics always sounds more exciting than the other provinces.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.112
I literally do not understand why those people didn't just get mugged and beaten to death as soon as they started stealing 2 million in student money and then throwing parties with it.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.113
If someone stole my money at school and then hired security guards I would feel no remorse what so ever if I were to stab them or anyone involved with their bullshit in the streets.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.114
I was thinking of posting a thread about this, nice job on the writeup.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.115
I'm at UBC now, but I went to Kwantlen for a couple of years and was quite satisfied with the quality of education (ok there was the one class where I ended up doing more teaching than the professor).
DF-232-195174-742_6353.116
Count me in as another person who is simply amazed that there is a student union out there with any sort of power at all.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.117
So what happened to the initial $2 million?
DF-232-195174-742_6353.118
Are they millionaires now?
DF-232-195174-742_6353.119
This is amazing, the student government in my university (Im British) basically has control over things that you simply WOULDNT change.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.120
There hands are tied in nearly any area were they could use their personal bias to achieve some neferious end
DF-232-195174-742_6353.121
(They cant choose not to allocate money to a club, if it has the membership requirements then it gets money.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.122
That simple.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.123
THen it gets more money dependent on a ton of other factors that are clearly defined and not negotiatable.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.124
The only "corruption" is the Russian Bolsh club.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.125
Which has near 400 members and therefore is entitled to a fair bit of funding, but the official meetings are literally just the founder going "right heres the funding we got, everyone gets a share" and then they split the money and leave.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.126
That is considered controversial in my University, the idea that people are getting pepper spreayed by their student council astounds me.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.127
At my school the student government theoretically can veto things set by the staff, but it has been all but neutered by the new administration who didn't give a gently caress.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.128
They even vetoed my election onto the social committee, although chances are, I would have spent all the money on parties anyway.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.129
I had the misfortune of taking a year of courses at this place 4 years ago - no offense to the OP who sounds like a pretty cool guy but it's garbage and nobody takes it seriously.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.130
I'm not surprised that this poo poo happened, but really it's not a big enough or important enough school for this to be anything more than a laughing matter.

Surrey at it's finest!

Edit: It's a university-college and even the university part of that is a recent change.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.134
It started out and is still mostly a polytechnic institute.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.135
Edit2: Welp since I've been paying attention they've somehow gotten the college part dropped from their name.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.136
I guess you can learn to weld at universities now.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.137
I'm curious to see how much this goes on at other schools.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.138
I never thought about it at mine or where my "student association fee" went.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.139
I just assumed it got us some cool poo poo like concerts.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.140
Then again, I did have a friend who was in student government and they always had trips to nice places for "conventions" or "workshops".
DF-232-195174-742_6353.141
You could literally pass this off as the plot to Old School 2 or something.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.142
I can't wrap my head around how any of this was allowed to happen.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.143
Are there no school staff members or executives present at these meetings?
DF-232-195174-742_6353.144
It's complicated, I'll grant you that.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.145
Being a student at the school requires that you're enrolled in the student union, which is a provincial organization and not individual for each school.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.146
Since it's required, the funds need to be charged to the student regardless of what school they're in, what classes they take, etc.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.147
So, to streamline the process, the universities make those charges for the union when a student enrolls, so the student makes one payment to the school rather than having to make seperate payments to seperate organizations.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.148
Then, once collected, the funds are transferred to the student unions.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.149
While the overall student union is provincial, each school is technically it's own independant branch and works independently.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.150
The branches are all administered under a societies act which they're all supposed to obey (much like a charter of rights).
DF-232-195174-742_6353.151
I don't know enough about the societies act to say if there's some sort of administering body over all of the other branches, but I don't think so.
DF-232-195174-742_6353.152
This group of assholes deliberately put things into place that specifically went against the societies act in a million different places (like giving themselves raises, firing people, etc.)
DF-232-195174-742_6353.153
I was in the meeting for that one, and it was shocking how arrogant they were about it:
DF-232-195174-742_6353.154
"You know that this is against the societies act in section A, B, and C, right?"
DF-232-195174-742_6353.155
"Our lawyers have said this is okay, so we're going to vote on it"
DF-232-195174-742_6353.156
"But it says clear as day right here that..."
DF-232-195174-742_6353.157
"All in favour raise your hand"

It's a racist shithole that throws out any minorities for being "too drunk" or "causing trouble".

UPDATE 11/14: Occupy Oakland has been cleared out!
DF-233-195232-785_4929.2
Police moved in before daybreak and started to clear out the camp.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.3
32 arrests so far, no violence.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.4
Also http://www.occupystreams.org/, the one site that linked to all the live Occupy videostreams has had its account suspended!
DF-233-195232-785_4929.5
This makes me think this week's police actions against Occupy camps is a FEDERALLY COORDINATED ACTION!
DF-233-195232-785_4929.6
If so people need to start focusing on the OBAMA administration next!

UPDATE 11/2: General Strike in Oakland shuts down Port of Oakland.

Protesters occupy Oscar Grant Plaza, halting all traffic.

The Oakland Mayor ordered police to clear the Occupy encampment in downtown.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.10
The police came out in force using Tear Gas and LRAD, a new non-lethal acoustic device that sends out painful waves of sound.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.11
Apparently other LE agencies are involved as CHP officers, and from all over the Bay area are there.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.12
In fact there appear to be more officers there than Oakland has on its force!
DF-233-195232-785_4929.13
There are hundreds of police and they have cordoned off the entire downtown Oakland area and are telling people not to go to work or open their business.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.14
Meanwhile more and more people are showing up to protest this police action.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.15
The scene is very "fluid" at the moment.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.16
People are very angry, and Oakland, being Oakland is very PRONE TO VIOLENCE.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.17
This isn't over yet!
DF-233-195232-785_4929.18
I'm tempted to go down there myself to protest this repression of our civil rights!
DF-233-195232-785_4929.19
Global Revolution is covering this LIVE right now!
DF-233-195232-785_4929.20
In europe they are allowed to kill people in case of an uprising.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.21
What are the US laws for that like?
DF-233-195232-785_4929.22
They will stir up an uprising that they can't control !!!!!
DF-233-195232-785_4929.23
Press Conference: They're saying the LRAD was deployed but not used.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.24
They say there were no injuries during the operation.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.25
They're very LUCKY!
DF-233-195232-785_4929.26
Oakland PD is notorious for resorting to violence when it's not even necessary.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.27
They've killed so many people for no good reason.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.28
So in Oakland they have very little respect for the police force.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.29
This could erupt, and would've had there been any violence on the part of police.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.30
The Mayor is not even in the city at the moment.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.31
OAKLAND is re-occupying right now amid tear gas and rubber bullets being fired!

Word on twitter now is that riot police gave 5 minute warning then started tear gas and flash bangs.
DF-233-195232-785_4929.34
They got gassed, (the videos I posted)...
DF-233-195232-785_4929.35
they retreated, regrouped, went back again... and they just got gassed again...

DF-233-195232-785_4951.1
I've been wondering this for a long time.
DF-233-195232-785_4951.2
I, and I think most people, really don't know what the POINT is.
DF-233-195232-785_4951.3
What is it Occupy expects the achieve?
DF-233-195232-785_4951.4
What policies are they trying to institute?
DF-233-195232-785_4951.5
What is the PLAN for change?
DF-233-195232-785_4951.6
I've seen the generic rants and posters.
DF-233-195232-785_4951.7
I know what the problem is.
DF-233-195232-785_4951.8
EVERYBODY knows what the problem is.
DF-233-195232-785_4951.9
But what exactly are we going to do about it?
DF-233-195232-785_4951.10
I've spent hours waiting at the station for my train, the leaders of Occupy Boston at the table across from me, hearing what they were talking about.
DF-233-195232-785_4951.11
There was never anything about a plan, just brainstorming ways to be more flamboyant.
DF-233-195232-785_4951.12
Everybody sees what's going on in the country.
DF-233-195232-785_4951.13
I'm just asking what Occupy's idea of how to FIX it is.
DF-233-195232-785_4951.14
Well considering an organized protest and a political party are not the same thing, I don't really expect the occupy movement to come up with a perfect plan to fix everything.
DF-233-195232-785_4951.15
I am glad they are doing what they are doing as its spreading awareness and showing the government and corporate america that a lot of the citizens are fed up and would like to see some positive changes.
DF-233-195232-785_4951.16
I would be more active in the movement, but it seems nearly impossible to get involved with it in colorado.
DF-233-195232-785_4951.17
I would like to see people who criticize the occupy protestors for not having a plan to fix the already falling system come up with an idea to improve things...but things are so screwed up its much easier said than done.
DF-233-195233-769_5897.1
So now Jack Kevorkain joins those he helped commit suicide.
DF-233-195233-769_5897.2
Whatever you may have thought of him I can't help wondering if we might see the day when what he did is a common practice, that we might even see euthanasia centers, and people will wonder what the controversy was all about.
DF-233-195233-769_5897.3
I don't agree with suicide under most circumstances but I do believe he helped a lot of people and that's got to count for something.

As we all know, the United States maintains hundreds of military bases and camps throughout the world.
DF-233-195234-769_7697.2
My initial thought is many posters on this site believe (as I tend to) this is a sign of an overbearing superpower that abuses its influence and over budgeted military spending to exert influence over international economies and policies.
DF-233-195234-769_7697.3
Now strangely, and this fascinates me, I've seen at least one or two individuals state they would think it a bad thing if the US withdrew from the world and closed down all these bases.
DF-233-195234-769_7697.4
Ultimately, both economic and otherwise, is US influence throughout the world a good thing or bad thing?
DF-233-195234-769_7697.5
Why?
DF-233-195234-769_7697.6
Negative - military presence only will begat war!
DF-233-195234-769_7697.7
I'm in the grey area, but i'm feeling like a zombie so i'll just say - Korea - and hope ya figure out my shade from that.
DF-233-195234-769_7697.8
Much depends on whether the premise used to justify the military presence is accepted.
DF-233-195234-769_7697.9
As recipients of news and information Americans can best be characterized as mushrooms- kept in the dark and fed shit.
DF-233-195234-769_7697.10

In the March 2005 issue of the magazine Popular Mechanics, an article has been constructed to "debunk conspiracy theorists" of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
DF-233-195235-765_4106.2
However, the article, not surprisingly, refrains from reporting on the real evidence and focuses solely on the obvious hoaxes and lies surrounding the attacks.
DF-233-195235-765_4106.3
In an attempt to discredit all 9/11 researchers, the article debunks obvious hoaxes and exaggerations such as a pod on the belly of the airliners, the idea that Flight 175 had no windows, the idea that no jet hit the Pentagon, and the fact that some windows at the Pentagon remained intact.
DF-233-195235-765_4106.4
At the same time, the article completely avoids the evidence that surrounds the true 9/11 skepticism.
DF-233-195235-765_4106.5
It fails to report on the warnings from U.S. allies about the attacks, the wargames in Virginia on 9/11, the NORAD "live fly" exercises on 9/11, the fighter planes which were sent the wrong way from Norfolk, the large shares of American and United Airlines stock traded only days before 9/11, and the fact that the Pentagon was struck in the nearly empty, recently reconstructed and strengthened sector.
DF-233-195235-765_4106.6
The Popular Mechanics article boldly asserts that all "9/11 conspiracy theorists" believe the obvious fakes and even goes as far as to accuse those who question the government's explanation of the attacks of disgracing "the memories of the thousands who died that day."
DF-233-195235-765_4106.7
Unfortunately, the article seems to focus on the shady 9/11 websites to make it appear as though the entire idea of 9/11 complicity is all a big joke concocted by storytellers.
DF-233-195235-765_4106.8
Disinformation such as "pods on planes," "no plane hit the Pentagon," "cellphones can't be used in airplanes," "there was no plane at the North Tower," and "there was no plane in Pennsylvania," have stained the image of those who simply desire the truth about 9/11.
DF-233-195235-765_4106.9
Websites such as thewebfairy.com, 911hoax.com, 911closeup.com, physics911.org, reopen911.org, 911skeptics.blogspot.com, rense.com, 911sharethetruth.com, thoughtcrimenews.com/wtc.htm, leftgatekeepers.com, warfolly.com, and 911-strike.com, among others, have unfortunately severely damaged the credibility of the true researchers.
DF-233-195235-765_4106.10
The article also failed to mention that the respectable 9/11 websites which support the idea of complicity have all debunked the hoaxes which it claims these people believe.
DF-233-195235-765_4106.11
If the idea of 9/11 complicity is ever to be taken seriously by the masses, people must stop buying into obvious hoaxes and disinformation and focus solely on the true facts.

Aren't you embarrassed to pass of this trash as a serious rebuttal?
