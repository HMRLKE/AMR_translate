bc.cctv_0000.5
Well , for several years , although it was still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be said that many people have viewed Hong Kong with new respect .
bc.cctv_0000.6
Then welcome to the official writing ceremony of Hong Kong Disneyland .
bc.cctv_0000.7
The construction of Hong Kong Disneyland began two years ago , in 2003 .
bc.cctv_0000.8
In January of that year , the Hong Kong government turned over to Disney Corporation 200 hectares of land at the foot of Lantau Island that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years .
bc.cctv_0000.9
One .
bc.cctv_0000.10
Since then , this area has become a prohibited zone in Hong Kong .

At subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for Disney on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy the park when it first opens .

bc.cctv_0000.20
However , before any of the Disney symbols were in sight , the car was stopped by a security guard at the intersection of the road towards Disney .
bc.cctv_0000.21
On our way back , the taxi driver gave us an explanation after understanding our intentions .
bc.cctv_0000.22
Er , according to what the security guard said , for the time before everything is officially opened , opened , all , no cars can enter unless they have special permission .
bc.cctv_0000.23
No one can enter otherwise .
bc.cctv_0000.24
Video recording is especially forbidden .
bc.cctv_0000.25
Ah , everything is top secret .
bc.cctv_0000.26
If pictures are taken without permission , %pw that is to say , it will at all times be pursued by legal action , a big hassle .

bc.cctv_0000.33

bc.cctv_0000.42
Meanwhile , as various new items are constantly being added , what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the Hong Kong tourism industry bring us ?
bc.cctv_0000.43
Over the past 28 years , the Ocean Park has basically been a must - see destination for tourists coming to Hong Kong .
bc.cctv_0000.44
Watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at the Ocean Theater , and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart - beat adventures on amusement rides .
bc.cctv_0000.45
Or ride the giant Ferris wheel to get a bird 's eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of Hong Kong Island and the South China Sea .
bc.cctv_0000.46
These items , which were the pride of the Ocean Park , have made this place the most popular tourist attraction in Hong Kong for some time .
bc.cctv_0000.47
However , since Disney entered Hong Kong , the Ocean Park , sharing the same city as Disney , has felt the pressure of competition .
bc.cctv_0000.48
To improve the park 's brand , they are planning to invest 5.5 billion in a renovation project starting in 2006 .
bc.cctv_0000.49

Hong Kong movies have even become a window for the world to see Hong Kong , which have made the image of metropolitan Hong Kong more prominent internationally .
bc.cctv_0000.74
For this reason , in 2004 , on the Waterfront Promenade originally constructed for viewing only the scenery of Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbor , the Hong Kong Tourism Board also constructed the Avenue of Stars , memorializing Hong Kong 's 100 - year film history .
bc.cctv_0000.75

Even at dusk , the city 's pulse never stops beating .
bc.cctv_0000.78
Across from the Avenue of Stars , a special performance is staged every weekend .
bc.cctv_0000.79
%pw As our Victoria Harbor is %pw very famous , and , er , our nightscape is already very beautiful , by what means could we enhance the dynamic beauty of our nightscape ?
bc.cctv_0000.80
So , one idea was to transform Victoria Harbor into a performance stage .
bc.cctv_0000.81
Er , each key building is like a performer .
bc.cctv_0000.82
It is based on this that music and lights are arranged to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinating multi-media world - class light show .

bc.cctv_0000.88
Whenever there is a major event or holiday , fireworks are also added to the light show .
bc.cctv_0000.89
Some , er , cities have consulted with us .
bc.cctv_0000.90
Uh-huh .
bc.cctv_0000.91
Their area of surprise was that those private , er , buildings , that is , the business community , ah , is willing to invest in our overall project .
bc.cctv_0000.92
Yes .
bc.cctv_0000.93
The answer is that this is a reward to the entire society , not an individual building 's reward .
bc.cctv_0000.94
Er , of course , after SARS , we felt that all of Hong Kong hopes to be involved , so that the Hong Kong tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sectors .
bc.cctv_0000.95
Hong Kong Wetland Park , which is currently under construction , is also one of the designated new projects of the Hong Kong SAR government for advancing the Hong Kong tourism industry .

Mai Po Marshes adjacent to Wetland Park is a major wildlife habitat within Asia .
bc.cctv_0000.125
Each year , over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong 's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .

As a result , three different types of aviaries were built in Hong Kong Wetland Park .
bc.cctv_0000.127
These have become the best spots to observe birds .
bc.cctv_0000.128
Among common birds , a rather special one is the black - faced spoonbill .
bc.cctv_0000.129
It is an endangered bird species throughout the world .

They will complete the park 's entire construction by the beginning of 2006 , to be able to participate in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year campaign .
bc.cctv_0000.140
Ah , we have established the year 2006 as Discover Hong Kong Year .
bc.cctv_0000.141
Why is that ?
bc.cctv_0000.142
Because , as everyone knows , our Disneyland will open in September of this year .
bc.cctv_0000.143
In addition , we will have Ngong Ping 360 , that is , the cable car , er , to the Giant Buddha .
bc.cctv_0000.144
They add to what we already have , like the Avenue of Stars , which is also very famous .
bc.cctv_0000.145
Moreover , er , we are including our software .
bc.cctv_0000.146
Hong Kong 's software is very well known .
bc.cctv_0000.147
Like what 's used in our Symphony of Lights .
bc.cctv_0000.148
We hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year .
bc.cctv_0000.149
Without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here .
bc.cctv_0000.150
A dream that has been anticipated for more than twenty years will soon come true here .
bc.cctv_0000.151
Because your line connects us with two --
bc.cctv_0000.152
In recent years , Hong Kong 's tourist attractions have gradually moved from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon and the New Territory .
bc.cctv_0000.153
Two out of the four new attractions participating in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year are located on Lantau Island of the New Territory .
bc.cctv_0000.154
For this reason , Lantau Island has become a new Hong Kong tourism popular spot .
bc.cctv_0000.155
The earliest to settle here was this world 's largest outdoor seated bronze Buddha .
bc.cctv_0000.156
In Chinese Buddhism , there are five directions - east , west , south , north , and center - and five Buddhas .
bc.cctv_0000.157
Therefore , Hong Kong 's Tian Tan Giant Buddha at the most southern tip of China , together with Lingshan Giant Buddha in the east , Leshan Giant Buddha in the west , Yungang Giant Buddha in the north , and Longmen Giant Buddha in the Central Plains , exist as the representative Buddhas for each of the five directions of China .
bc.cctv_0000.158
As a result , this place has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees .
bc.cctv_0000.159
However , to common tourists , more of what this place brings them is wonder and awe .
bc.cctv_0000.160
Since this giant bronze Buddha settled on Lantau Island , the world renowned Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok and Disneyland have also been constructed here in succession .
bc.cctv_0000.161
The important status of Lantau Island is increasingly apparent .
bc.cctv_0000.162
No , it was totally inaccessible in the past .
bc.cctv_0000.163
In the near future , construction will also begin on a cross-sea bridge connecting Hong Kong , Zhuhai , and Macao .
bc.cctv_0000.164
In 1992 --
bc.cctv_0000.165
Could n't go in summer --
bc.cctv_0000.166
So , after their return , Macao , and Hong Kong , the two special administrative regions , are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected .
bc.cctv_0000.167
It 's extremely troublesome to get there via land .
bc.cctv_0000.168
One has to go up to Shenzhen , Dongguan , then go through Panyu , keep going up , to Zhongshan , and certainly go to Zhuhai , then pass through Zhuhai to get to Macao .
bc.cctv_0000.169
For a Hong Kong person choosing to go there via land , it 's extremely inconvenient .
bc.cctv_0000.170
A full twenty years ago , Hopewell Holdings Group Chairman Wu Ying - sheung , a well - known construction tycoon , boldly made a cross-sea bridge proposal .
bc.cctv_0000.171
With this bridge , the distance would be very small , only a little over one kilometer .
bc.cctv_0000.172
However , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off .
bc.cctv_0000.173
This is what we have seen since 1999 .
bc.cctv_0000.174
Anticipated for 20 years , today this dream is finally coming true .
bc.cctv_0000.175
Well , originally the construction of the new --
bc.cctv_0000.176
With this new Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao bridge that basically leads to all three places , Hong Kong , Macao , and Zhuhai , basically , at the start of the bridge , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .
bc.cctv_0000.177
Macao is this way , and Zhuhai is this way .
bc.cctv_0000.178
From the perspective of either Hong Kong , Macao , or Zhuhai , our concept is a tourism zone .
bc.cctv_0000.179
Er , %pw Zhuhai for sightseeing tours , Macao for entertainment , and we have Disneyland and other , other attractions in Hong Kong .
bc.cctv_0000.180
Each place has different attractions of its own .
bc.cctv_0000.181
So , with this bridge , when some old friends , friends from mainland China or from foreign countries come to our place , it seems they can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days , before , ha , going home .
bc.cctv_0000.182
Once the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge is built , it will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in Macao before having fun at Disneyland just an hour later .
bc.cctv_0000.183
Promotion of Hong Kong Disneyland has long since begun .
bc.cctv_0000.184
However , even though it has entered the last countdown period before its final opening , this wonderland is still unwilling to take off its mysterious veil .
bc.cctv_0000.185
Ah , currently it has been decided that Disney will open on September 12 .
bc.cctv_0000.186
There 's also what we call soft opening .
bc.cctv_0000.187
Ah , they are now rehearsing .
bc.cctv_0000.188
Ah , different , ah , some groups , they are rehearsing their service , well , hoping that they will become used to the service , be familiar with it , when our tourists come in September .
bc.cctv_0000.189
Well , I am very confident , that when our tourists come to Disneyland , they will certainly return home very satisfied .
bc.cctv_0000.190
The Wonder Tour will start from Hong Kong .
bc.cctv_0000.191
This dynamic metropolis never ceases its movement .
bc.cctv_0000.192
It continues to explore ; it continues to open new worlds .
bc.cctv_0000.193
Each day , there is always something new for people to experience and to love about this city .

Establishing Models in Industrial Innovation
bolt12_07_4800.2
After its competitor invented the front loading washing machine, the CEO of the American IM company believed that each of its employees had the ability for innovation , and formulated strategic countermeasures for innovation in the industry.
bolt12_07_4800.3
1. Establish an innovation fund with a maximum amount of 1,000 U.S. dollars.
bolt12_07_4800.4
2. Choose 100 innovative concepts to encourage employees to conduct research and development during their work time or spare time.

3. From among them, pick out 50 for submission to an assessment committee to assess.
bolt12_10465_5552.1
Since the Tangshan Earthquake, the starting point for construction standards in the mainland is that under an earthquake of the same magnitude, buildings should preserve their basic frame without collapsing.
bolt12_10465_5552.2
However, most of the buildings in this hard-hit area did not meet these requirements, with the widespread collapse of school buildings in particular arousing intense public disgust.
bolt12_10465_5552.3
Raising standards to in excess of Tangshan's 8.0 magnitude could leave authorities with some breathing space for explanation, and alleviate public anger.
bolt12_10465_5552.4
According to information leaked from numerous channels, we can say for certain that before the earthquake struck, the serious earthquake risk in the Ngawa region was already well known to the CCP.
bolt12_10465_5552.5
Although current forecasting standards cannot give us an accurate prediction of the exact time, place, and strength of an earthquake, there is considerable experience accumulated both in China and overseas in predicting to within the timeframe of a month, and the area of a province.
bolt12_10465_5552.6
In regions where the earthquake risk is high, warning the public and spreading disaster prevention awareness could greatly reduce casualties during earthquakes; this is the very minimum duty that any responsible government should undertake.
bolt12_10465_5552.7
In the past the CCP has done a lot of these sorts of things, but on this occasion not only did nothing, but in response to queries from the public pulled out some whopping lies, playing syntax games with words like "geological disaster" and "earthquake disaster".
bolt12_10465_5592.1
I think that if our Earthquake Administration had been able beforehand to do a simulation of big earthquakes on this Longmenshan mountain earthquake belt, then on that day of May 12, once the Earthquake Administration had measured the quake at a magnitude of 7.8, we would have been able to broadly judge the extent of damage and destruction in the earthquake disaster zone.
bolt12_10465_5592.2
If the simulation program was well designed, circumstances like debris blocking roads, heavy rainfall obstructing parachute drops, power and communication outages should all have been within expectations.
bolt12_10465_5592.3
Instead in this instance the Liberation Army headquarters emergency contingency plan obviously was not a contingency plan designed with earthquakes as the assumed condition, as the soldiers all rushed straight to Wenchuan, without immediately sending out troops in the direction of badly-hit areas Beichuan, Qingchuan and Gansu's Longnan; only 24 hours later was the full extent of the disaster area taken into consideration.
bolt12_10465_5592.4
In addition, the breakdown in communication also brought a serious problem to the surface. In the past, Red Army regiments were able to maintain contact with central headquarters by relying on just one battered radio. On this occasion though, people had no way to deal with the communication failure.
bolt12_10465_5592.5
It is clear that preparations prior to the event were not constructed on the basis of an earthquake disaster simulation.
bolt12_10474_1421.1
While it should have been a disaster relief command that takes overall leadership, it has suddenly come face-to-face with the broad base of disaster victims, directly dealing with them.
bolt12_10474_1421.2
The lack or serious shortage of intermediate layers of Party organizations and units between the two has resulted in its inability to consider major issues with endless minor issues on hand, such that even if it is highly capable, it won't last long, as it will be dragged down by numerous petty things.
bolt12_10474_1421.3
This would have been unimaginable during the Great Tangshan Earthquake. A time without volunteers or mental workers, such petty things as directly dealing with average people were performed by the most primary Party branches, as well as enterprises and public institutions.
bolt12_10474_1421.4
As soon as the earthquake occurred, grass-root organizations contacted their own people and average people also contacted their own systems or departments, in an interdependent manner.
bolt12_10474_1421.5
Under the centralized leadership of higher-level organizations, everyone acted to make the rescue efforts very outstanding and successful, such that the Great Tangshan Earthquake, which happened just a few years ago, was forgotten all together in the subsequent reform and opening-up.
bolt12_10474_1421.6
It is obvious that no social or political problems were left then, nor were sequelae that cause headaches to later generations.
bolt12_10474_1831.1
During a time of prosperity and happiness, such a big earthquake suddenly struck.
bolt12_10474_1831.2
Many people died, much property was destroyed, it was quite clearly a great disaster.
bolt12_10474_1831.3
But it was not totally without benefits, and I believe that its greatest benefit was that it served to strip off the false benevolence that composed the outer skin of the elitists, the politicians, the capitalists, and exposed once and for all the rotten cannibalistic core within.
bolt12_10474_1831.4
And an additional benefit was that many people who had been deluded came to their senses.
bolt12_10474_1831.5
Temporarily laid aside these abstract things and avoided speaking at length, saying only a few details that left the elitists, the politicians and capitalists highly embarrassed.
bolt12_10474_1831.6
The experts had just finished saying "Sacrificing yourself to help others is a foolish idea", when the leaders had no choice but to call once again for selfless devotion.
bolt12_10474_1831.7
This was mere chicanery, to the point where before engaging in life-saving, donation to charity, these sorts of behaviors, an idea had to be flashing through people's minds:
bolt12_10474_1831.8
Am I being foolish in doing this?
bolt12_10474_1831.9
And when people saw on CCTV those private firms manufacturing tents in Jiangsu and Zhejiang working overtime to produce more tents, the first idea that popped to mind I'm afraid was probably "This time these capitalists have struck it big!"
bolt12_10474_1831.10
"Why is it that these capitalists instead of those capitalists get the big order forms, surely there couldn't be anything fishy involved?
bolt12_10489_5932.1
During this process, there were again talks about filing a complaint against the Xinghui Travel Agency.
bolt12_10489_5932.2
The reason for filing the complaint is that even if we owed their hourly fees, they still should fulfill their obligation on the contract they signed: driving people from Canberra back to Sydney.
bolt12_10489_5932.3
As long as we stick to this issue, Xinghui surely has no way of winning the lawsuit if it goes to court.
bolt12_10489_5932.4
However, what greatly surprised me was the attitude of the student union in this appeal. They seemed very reluctant to make the contract public.
bolt12_10489_5932.5
They even lied, saying that they and Xinghui initially felt that signing a contract would rather make each other feel like strangers since they were both doing it for the sake of the motherland.
bolt12_10489_5932.6
As you know, this type of logic absolutely won't work in Australia.
bolt12_10489_5932.7
Xinghui accepted this order of ours and deployed all the buses of other travel agencies in Sydney.
bolt12_10489_5932.8
Without the guarantee from the contract signed with us, they would surely have been unable to deploy them!
bolt12_10489_5932.9
In addition, there was something else that was very suspicious.
bolt12_10489_5932.10
I heard from a friend at the consulate that the government took this matter very seriously and had promptly agreed to allocate funds to compensate the students who had used their own money instead that night.
bolt12_10489_6271.1
Yesterday afternoon I went back to check out the torch relay, but even the flame was practically impossible to see, let alone the guys carrying the torch.
bolt12_10489_6271.2
There were so many people there it was frightening. Some had even climbed onto the roofs of buses!
bolt12_10489_6271.3
I headed straight for the center of activities, but in actual fact traffic was being controlled as early as 4 o'clock, and they had already started limiting the crowds entering the sports center.
bolt12_10489_6271.4
Some guys were really insane, banding together in groups and yelling out "Go China!"
bolt12_10489_6271.5
I actually had some other classmates there, and was going to call them.
bolt12_10489_6271.6
I guessed the carrying capacity of the base station towers was totally overloaded, and I couldn't get through at all. I was only able to find a signal, not a chance of connecting to the Internet.
bolt12_10489_6271.7
Only one phone call I made there got through - that was calling home.
bolt12_10489_6271.8
I had a look at my call register, and out of dozens of calls dialed only one was properly connected!
bolt12_10489_6271.9
Sometime after 6 I went straight back home to watch it on TV. The spectacle was just as astonishing on TV, except that it was just one angle of the whole thing.
bolt12_10489_6271.10
Next time I won't be partaking in this kind of activity!!
bolt12_10494_3592.1
Wang Shi's experience of being under public condemnation underscored to a certain extent the tense relationship between the rich and poor classes in Chinese society;
bolt12_10494_3592.2
because as China grows prosperous day by day, the gap of wealth between the successful elite and the remaining 1.3 billion people is widening.
bolt12_10494_3592.3
Thirty years ago, people had basically the same incomes, which were all deplorably meager.
bolt12_10494_3592.4
However, Hurun Report (Hurun Report) shows that by 2007, there were a total of 106 billionaires (in U.S. dollars) in China, with the number of people only next to that of the United States.
bolt12_10494_3592.5
Now, Wang Shi said, these responses have had effects on me.
bolt12_10494_3592.6
He admitted that he was not sensitive enough to the current situation when he wrote his blog.
bolt12_10494_3592.7
Wang Shi noted additionally that since China currently has not yet established a sound system of social security insurance, the growing hatred of the rich is unavoidable.
bolt12_10494_3592.8
On Tuesday, Wanke announced that it would make an additional donation of RMB 100 million yuan for the temporary resettlement and post-disaster reconstruction in the next three to five years.
bolt12_10494_3592.9
Yao Ming, the basketball player who was hailed as a national hero thanks to his success in establishing himself in NBA, was also blamed after he announced his donation of RMB two million yuan because a rumor on the Internet alleged he had donated one million U.S. dollars for disaster relief of Hurricane Katrina (Hurricane) in 2005.
bolt12_10494_4343.1
Even so, donation behavior and the treatment of donation behavior should not deviate from two principles, namely that it is voluntary and does not seek return. Otherwise, the donation loses its original meaning.
bolt12_10494_4343.2
In actual fact, whether it is McDonalds or any other foreign owned enterprises in China on the so-called "international iron rooster" blacklist, they all gave generously to the cause of helping the disaster victims, exhibiting their social responsibility.
bolt12_10494_4343.3
Even if by comparison some companies really didn't donate a huge amount, they should not be besieged or subjected to verbal violence in the arena of public opinion.
bolt12_10494_4343.4
Donating, after all, is not a legal obligation that companies must carry out. Urging businesses to donate apart from the force of moral considerations should not take the form of any other coercive means.
bolt12_10494_4343.5
As long as a company's source of income is legal, any compulsory payment outside of legal obligations is a kind of theft.
bolt12_10494_4343.6
Even in an abnormal circumstance such as disaster relief, legal order and the rights bestowed upon by law should be respected.
bolt12_10494_4343.7
If we are unfortunate enough to be unable to avoid becoming a disaster victim, we can at least preserve the nobility and dignity of humanity and not turn into rabble.
bolt12_10495_0392.1
The lawsuit proposed by Hai Ming did not have a clear subject of the right of action; moreover it did not satisfy the legal requirement for libel.
bolt12_10495_0392.2
For example, he failed to clarify whether Cafferty's comment was an argument over opinions or an act of spreading an untruthful statement.
bolt12_10495_0392.3
The malicious intent of Cafferty has not been established, either. More importantly, he has been unable to offer anything as to how to establish the damage to the 1.3 billion Chinese people.
bolt12_10495_0392.4
In addition, in his complaint, it is said that Chinese people have already expressed their displeasure through demonstrations.
bolt12_10495_0392.5
Here it is a country with the freedom of speech.
bolt12_10495_0392.6
On the issue of libel, courts only support those who have actually suffered damages and have no other way to seek justice.
bolt12_10495_0392.7
Therefore, it is very hard for the government, politicians, and public figures to get legal protection on the issue of libel,
bolt12_10495_0392.8
because they have the capability to clear themselves of "smears."
bolt12_10495_0392.9
If you have already cleared your own reputation through legal protests, for example, Chinese people are not goons and thugs, then a lawsuit is meaningless.
bolt12_10495_0392.10
Remember, a lawsuit for libel is only to clear your name and get compensation.
bolt12_10495_6194.1
After Lee Teng-hui put forth the "two states theory", due to mainland countrymen being deceived by the CCP's propaganda machine, many people advocated using force to unite Taiwan.
bolt12_10495_6194.2
Because they have no understanding whatsoever of the situation in Taiwan and the will of the Taiwan people,
bolt12_10495_6194.3
they universally exhibited extreme nationalistic sentiment.
bolt12_10495_6194.4
Just like the love-hate fusion of nationalistic war sentiment that erupted after the US mistakenly bombed the Chinese embassy.
bolt12_10495_6194.5
They similarly did not understand the real story in Kosovo.
bolt12_10495_6194.6
But Hong Kong people realize that first there was the Republic of China, only after that came "New China";
bolt12_10495_6194.7
While this "Two States Separatist Theory" has purely and simply been dreamed up by the CCP.
bolt12_10495_6194.8
Lee Teng-hui was doing nothing but bringing an already existing phenomenon to light.
bolt12_10495_6194.9
Moreover, the grand old men of the CCP who handed over on a silver platter a huge chunk of land in Manchuria north of the Amur River to Soviet Russia, who gave away land equivalent to ten percent of national territory in northern Mongolia; why not take this back, instead of insisting on trying to grab back a Taiwan that remains in the hands of Chinese people?
bolt12_10495_6194.10
However, even though Hong Kong people have their grumbles, the "two states theory" has in no way triggered a sentimental attachment in Hong Kong people for "Old China".
bolt12_10510_8171.1
I believe that our building industry here has not yet reached this level.
bolt12_10510_8171.2
Not only has the law not yet reached this level, but the average person's understanding has generally not reached this level.
bolt12_10510_8171.3
Some officials, out of local economic considerations, by accident or design are frequently too lenient in dealing with property agents.
bolt12_10510_8171.4
We all saw the damage wreaked by the Wenchuan Earthquake.
bolt12_10510_8171.5
As to how much of this was a result of natural disaster, and how much was man-made calamity, a verdict will be drawn in the end.
bolt12_10510_8171.6
Apparently, quality checks in the space industry are extremely rigorous, each part undergoes several inspection processes, every effort is made to ensure absolute safety.
bolt12_10510_8171.7
But space ship accidents still happen from time to time.
bolt12_10510_8171.8
Even such technologically advanced nations as the US have experienced several instances of space flight launch or return failures.
bolt12_10510_8171.9
Since things can still go wrong even when they are subjected to incredibly rigorous inspections as in the space industry, then, with our current "dark" and corrupt property industry the way it is, people's lives are even harder to place guarantees on.
bolt12_10510_8171.10
Once a powerful earthquake strikes, the people's lives really do become as tiny as those of ants.
bolt12_10510_8171.11
It makes one tremble even without fear.
bolt12_10510_8841.1
Following the Great Wenchuan Earthquake this time, there were compatriots who struggled out of the debris, wiped their tears and buried the bodies of their families, but they braced up again and declared to the world, "we are not beaten down; we are on our feet again; the earthquake cannot shake the staunch will of the Chinese people; trials and tribulations serve only to revitalize a nation!"
bolt12_10510_8841.2
This enables us to see the fighting spirits of the dauntless Chinese nation give off a dazzling radiance among people in disaster-hit areas.
bolt12_10510_8841.3
The fact that these words are spoken by compatriots who have been through the disaster has given us, who couldn't help our tears at the sight of their mishaps, so much comfort and encouragement. It gives us a hint that no force can beat down the Chinese people.
bolt12_10510_8841.4
However, the words later reappeared somewhere else and from someone unusual, which I thought about for a few days. I feel, for some unknown reason, it is somewhat scary!
bolt12_10510_8841.5
I just want to say, let there be no more disasters, so that China is safe and sound from now on and disasters are far away from China.
bolt12_10510_8841.6
I pray to the God to open his eyes and don't let disasters visit the Chinese land again!
bolt12_10510_8841.7
We don't want to revitalize the nation through trials and tribulations,
bolt12_10510_8841.8
but rather we want to revitalize the nation by passing our days safe and sound!
bolt12_10510_9303.1
One important reason that a great number of people buried or trapped in debris in the Wenchuan earthquake-hit area were saved is that they were full of hopes and firmly believed the PLA would come to their rescue!
bolt12_10510_9303.2
To settle victims, thousands of tents that stretched miles were soon set up, which contained public toilets, shops, and primary schools and middle schools.
bolt12_10510_9303.3
Tens of thousands or even millions of those displaced by the disaster have gradually had a home to shelter from the wind and rain!
bolt12_10510_9303.4
If everything were put in the market, such that all the land was sold to syndicates or farm owners, then where should the government set up tents?
bolt12_10510_9303.5
Do they expropriate the land on the spot?
bolt12_10510_9303.6
Even the government cannot override the market!
bolt12_10510_9303.7
Supporting the disaster-hit areas has tested our competence, while the government's ability to rule also stood the trial!
bolt12_10510_9303.8
At critical moments, the ruling foundation --- workers and farmers, showed staunch support to the government!
bolt12_10510_9303.9
If everything were put in the market, such that workers and farmers would have their fates controlled by the market and no longer count on or rely on the government by walking onto a path of the so-called "finding the market rather than the mayor (government)," then what power would the government have?
bolt12_10510_9303.10
The post-catastrophe hyperinflation as expected by foreigners has not come either!
bolt12_10510_9303.11
The government has human and financial capital under control, as well as energy and resources!
bolt12_10510_9313.1
For example, the value of "seizing the pleasure of the moment" also has a long history.
bolt12_10510_9313.2
"Sing a song when thou have wine, seize the day since life is short." Some people in contemporary times think we should "satisfy and die."
bolt12_10510_9313.3
Some people have gone so far on the road that they "don't know how to eat or play,"
bolt12_10510_9313.4
and other take nude pictures and flaunt them online.
bolt12_10510_9313.5
For another example, the pursuit of office titles and levels can also be traced back to the old days.
bolt12_10510_9313.6
In ancient times there was Zhou Li to distinguish the order of hierarchy and nobility, constructing a pyramid-like social organizational structure.
bolt12_10510_9313.7
The son of the Heaven wore different clothes than others. The color of a door and the number of caldrons used for meals were all symbols to distinguish the hierarchy and nobility of people.
bolt12_10510_9313.8
The aim was to settle disputes, stop fights and stabilize the society.
bolt12_10510_9313.9
However, simultaneously it has also established a system that values life according to office levels, which to the contrary triggered contentions and destabilized the society.
bolt12_10510_9313.10
Yet no matter how many changes of dynasties there are, the value system has always been carried on.
bolt12_10510_9313.11
Higher or lower ranks in Qing Dynasty were distinguished by bird and animal patterns on clothes, Taiping Heavenly Kingdom used the size and color of a sedan chair as the symbol to distinguish between different ranks, and modern people use the motor vehicle displacement as a symbol to distinguish between different positions, all of which can be traced to the same origin.
bolt12_10510_9581.1
I don't care how much Wang Shi wastes every time he climbs a mountain, but I do strongly despise how he talks and the way he acts during this whole thing.
bolt12_10510_9581.2
After donating, he suggested that charity should not be the burden of businesses, and therefore stipulated that his company's employee donations should not exceed 10 yuan.
bolt12_10510_9581.3
Totally absurd logic. Wang Shi's reasoning is that making donations to charities then the burden of businesses could cause companies to fail in market competition;
bolt12_10510_9581.4
But we can see such philanthropists as Bill Gates, Li Ka-shing, Jackie Chan have not affected the growth of their enterprises in any way. Instead, they have actually increased the competitiveness of their companies.
bolt12_10510_9581.5
And there were some netizens who hit back in the Wang Shi donations issue by admonishing us for forcing donations on moral grounds.
bolt12_10510_9581.6
Exactly! An excellent justification!
bolt12_10510_9581.7
If you say that netizens rebuking Wang Shi is forcing donations, then what kind of behavior is Wang Shi preventing employees from donating more than 10 yuan?
bolt12_10510_9581.8
Wang Shi is the economic version of a cold-blooded animal, and we don't care,
bolt12_10510_9581.9
but how come Wang Shi, how come he wants to restrict what employees do or don't do on moral grounds?
bolt12_10510_9581.10
This really is a case of one rule for some, another rule for everyone else!!!
bolt12_10510_9692.1
We see, as at May 17, the Chinese government has accepted up to 6 billion in disaster-relief donations domestically and internationally, of which 4.8 billion is from domestic donors.
bolt12_10510_9692.2
What we can see now are merely the name and figure of each donor constantly listed in what is like an honor roll.
bolt12_10510_9692.3
Yet unfortunately, we don't have more detailed information of the whereabouts and specific uses of the donated funds.
bolt12_10510_9692.4
As corruption has long been prevalent among local governments and economic auditing is not transparent enough, disaster-relief funds are often appropriated, exhausted, expropriated and embezzled.
bolt12_10510_9692.5
Therefore, once such a huge amount of disaster-relief funds from people the world and China are embezzled or otherwise partially transferred by local officials, the resulting political damage and lowering of the government's image domestically and internationally will completely negate the positive image brought by the government's disaster-relief efforts.
bolt12_10510_9692.6
If the donations are directly put in the hands of disaster-hit people, it would push local prices higher, driving the already high inflation to a direction that is even harder to regulate.
bolt12_10510_9791.1
It is said that our country's earthquake forecasting is at an advanced level in the world.
bolt12_10510_9791.2
But the glory of the earthquake workers did not produce good luck for the departed spirits of Wenchuan.
bolt12_10510_9791.3
So, we again hear expert figures emphasizing once again, "Earthquake forecasts are a global challenge that so far no one has been able to solve."
bolt12_10510_9791.4
Consequently, we come to realize that the academic laurels for "the success rates of predictions of impending earthquakes that have already reached almost 40%" are just conditions and capital used to apply for funding, evaluate professional titles and seek remuneration, rather than a hard rationale used to reduce bloodshed and deaths.
bolt12_10510_9791.5
We should offer earthquake workers our full understanding.
bolt12_10510_9791.6
Facing the caprice of nature, humankind is really insignificant.
bolt12_10510_9791.7
Furthermore, although our sense of security increases with each passing day in line with "significant advances achieved" in seismology, we cannot look to anyone to give us any promises.
bolt12_10510_9791.8
Because, once someone has made a promise, he would be doomed thereafter to bear this bloody weight of "being unable to effectively avoid earthquake disasters."
bolt12_10510_9791.9
And by not issuing any promises, he could actually avoid being censured.
bolt12_10510_9791.10
Because "there is no way to make predictions"!
bolt12_10510_9796.1
Humans can manufacture tanks that are much more powerful than ants, but humans cannot manufacture a living ant...
bolt12_10510_9796.2
However advanced instruments manufactured by humans are, their level of complexity cannot compare with a section of a toad's nerve.
bolt12_10510_9796.3
Do not regard earthquake prediction as a "practical skill"; rather regard it as academic work in a study.
bolt12_10510_9796.4
Take no notice of the real results in terms of preventing earthquakes or minimizing disasters; rather singlemindedly pursue the scientific research level embodied in "prediction success rates."
bolt12_10510_9796.5
In the course of major disaster warnings, too many disputes relating to powers and interests are entangled.
bolt12_10510_9796.6
The directions of research into earthquake prevention and disaster minimization are just confined to research into the phenomenon of earthquakes, but efforts to intervene in urban construction, to formulate and supervise building standards, and perfect and improve disaster rescue mechanisms and other aspects have been neglected.... .
bolt12_10510_9796.7
We have also become blindly abreast of foreign countries even in earthquake research: we don't believe in living beings raised as part of nature; we just believe in the instruments we ourselves manufacture.
bolt12_10510_9796.8
We don't believe the warnings sent out by nature; we just believe the warnings emitted by instruments in laboratories.
bolt12_10510_9796.9
We don't believe in what is seen and heard with their own eyes by millions of ordinary people; we just believe in the authoritative conclusions of experts and scholars.
bolt12_10510_9796.10
Chinese seismology is galloping down the wrong road.
bolt12_10510_9811.1
Real estate is only one part of the national economy but the real estate phenomenon exists in every sector of the national economy.
bolt12_10510_9811.2
The swift large-scale failure and bankruptcy of collective enterprises and state-owned enterprises is proof of this.
bolt12_10510_9811.3
Things have reached the step where the national television station has to set up a stage with the country's military singers, high-class singers, as well as top-of-the-line celebrities from all walks of life singing to folks like Wang Shi for donations.
bolt12_10510_9811.4
We shouldn't be too bothered if folks like Wang Shi say something unpleasant.
bolt12_10510_9811.5
A defeated general can't claim to be brave.
bolt12_10510_9811.6
In front of folks like Wang Shi, the State Council are all defeated generals.
bolt12_10510_9811.7
Because the missing-in-action army who built New China have been beaten to a pulp by folks like Wang Shi; even if China has no earthquakes, there will be floods, as well as SARS, snowstorms, big freezes etc.
bolt12_10510_9811.8
China is a land of many catastrophes - this has always been true and always will be.
bolt12_10510_9811.9
Relying on singing for donations, entertaining for one's supper, will not solve the problem.
bolt12_10510_9811.10
And time and time again asking the national television station to get out there and carry the national flag, carrying on like this in the name of the country is outrageous, it's the State Council's problem.
bolt12_10510_9811.11
All the people with one mind" as the national anthem is inspired by the foresight of "always being prepared", designed for "advance, advance, advance, enter!" instead of being designed for repeated begging, pleading for donations, and fund-raising.
bolt12_10510_9811.12
From leaders to the common people, everyone needs to keep that in mind.
bolt12_10510_9873.1
When we go back to the 10th Century AD, we find that the 10th Century AD gave birth to the first entrepreneurs.
bolt12_10510_9873.2
Because the 10th Century AD was the very time when limited liability companies were established; the Catholic Pope of the time had such a conviction during the 9th Century.
bolt12_10510_9873.3
Are you afraid of going to Hell when you die?
bolt12_10510_9873.4
Yes, you are afraid - how could you not go just because you are afraid?
bolt12_10510_9873.5
Donate your property to the Church, show your loyalty to God and you won't go to Hell,
bolt12_10510_9873.6
so a lot of rich people donated their money to the Church before they died.
bolt12_10510_9873.7
By the 10th Century AD, 60% of Britain's territory belonged to the Church,
bolt12_10510_9873.8
but their clergymen couldn't manage it, and were unable to pass it on to the next generation. What could they do?
bolt12_10510_9873.9
So they set up the modern limited liability company.
bolt12_10510_9873.10
How did they set it up?
bolt12_10510_9873.11
They hired professional managers to run these Church enterprises,
bolt12_10510_9873.12
these professional managers were the administrators,
bolt12_10510_9873.13
And who were the proprietors of these companies?
bolt12_10510_9873.14
The Church.
bolt12_10510_9873.15
So what did this confirm?
bolt12_10510_9873.16
The first step in separating the administration rights from ownership,
bolt12_10510_9873.17
in no way because this was a great system, but rather that this was inevitable within the Church enterprises.
bolt12_10511_2816.1
When forecasting earthquakes, why did it happen that only a few cases were successful while most cases were failures?
bolt12_10511_2816.2
According to this writer's many years of research on precursory signs, the existence of precursory signs and earthquake predictions are two issues that are both connected and mutual differentiated.
bolt12_10511_2816.3
The appearance of a precursory sign doesn't mean it can accurately forecast the three elements of an earthquake, because precursory signs are extremely complicated.
bolt12_10511_2816.4
There are certain differences in the categories, breadths, distribution ranges, and duration of precursory signs of different types of earthquakes in different places.
bolt12_10511_2816.5
In "Regional Nature of Precursory Signs of Earthquakes," this writer divides earthquakes into two major types according to the overall characteristics of pre-earthquake signs: strike-type and slip-type earthquakes.
bolt12_10511_2816.6
The former occurs in areas where internal fault blocks or fault lines converge but not intersect, while the latter occurs in active fault lines.
bolt12_10511_2816.7
Strike-type earthquakes have various types of precursory signs, which are widespread, long-lasting, and quite variable.
bolt12_10511_2816.8
Slip-type earthquakes have fewer types of precursory signs, which have a smaller distribution range, shorter duration period, and smaller range of change.
bolt12_10511_2844.1
In Chengdu, which is over 100 kms away from the epicenter, the earthquake should not have an intensity of over 7, or 8 at the most.
bolt12_10511_2844.2
There should not be any safety problems for Class A buildings like those at the airport, hospitals and schools that are designed to withstand a intensity of 8.
bolt12_10511_2844.3
So most buildings in Chengdu should still be able to use after emergency assessment, and citizens may go home reassured.
bolt12_10511_2844.4
If not so, an investigation should be conducted for any jerry-built projects.
bolt12_10511_2844.5
If large sums of money have been spent to provide protection, yet it fails to work when the earthquake comes,
bolt12_10511_2844.6
such that nobody dares to live at home, is able to use hospitals, or accesses airports, then has the money been thrown for nothing?
bolt12_10511_2844.7
Probably some would say the national building criteria for earthquake resistance was enacted in recent years, and older buildings may not comply with the requirements.
bolt12_10511_2844.8
However, at the same time the government enacted the earthquake resistance criteria, it required all existing buildings which did not satisfy the criteria to be reinforced and removed of dangers in a timely fashion.
bolt12_10511_2844.9
Thus one cannot shirk responsibilities on excuse that it is an old building.
bolt12_10511_2844.10
In addition, the government also has criteria for earthquake resistance and prevention for rural buildings.
bolt12_10511_2851.1
The earthquake in Sichuan stuns everyone.
bolt12_10511_2851.2
Elementary school buildings collapsed, and children were buried in the rubble.
bolt12_10511_2851.3
Middle school buildings collapsed, and young students were buried under the crumbled walls.
bolt12_10511_2851.4
Kindergarten buildings also collapsed, and little children's frail bodies fell helplessly next to the crumbled walls where they closed their innocent eyes forever.
bolt12_10511_2851.5
We couldn't help crying at this sorrowful scene.
bolt12_10511_2851.6
Children are the flowers of our motherland and future of our motherland.
bolt12_10511_2851.7
These flowers of life died early in a natural disaster.
bolt12_10511_2851.8
Natural disasters cannot be predicted, but the school buildings should not have collapsed.
bolt12_10511_2851.9
Why are the buildings behind the school buildings still there while the school buildings where children studied collapsed from the first floor to the fourth floor leaving only crumbled walls?
bolt12_10511_2851.10
Children, you shouldn't have departed like this.
bolt12_10511_2851.11
Every year, all levels of People's Congress are held from local governments to the Central Government.
bolt12_10511_2851.12
Deputies to the People's Congress, please make an all-around inspection of school buildings in all areas and inspect whether or not the school buildings in your constituencies are up to local earthquake-resistance standards, and then quickly make a proposal according to the existing problems and push each level of the government to complete rectifications and improvements within a limited time.
bolt12_10511_2851.13
Special legislation in the National People's Congress on construction of school buildings should be proposed.
bolt12_10511_2851.14
There needs to be special legal procedures for the design, materials, construction, completion, and inspection of the school buildings to ensure that top priority be given to quality and durability.
bolt12_10511_2851.15
Allowing all children to study safely is the sacred and bounden duty of the People's Congress.
bolt12_10511_2891.1
In June 1976, 83 year-old Mao Zedong had already been revived once after suffering a myocardial infarction.
bolt12_10511_2891.2
To get effective care for his condition, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CCP established a special treatment team, in charge of his medical treatment and care.
bolt12_10511_2891.3
The Political Bureau also specifically assigned people to the task of Mao Zedong's medical care, taking turns with the doctors and nurses to be on constant vigil at his living quarters.
bolt12_10511_2891.4
On the day of the Tangshan Earthquake, i.e. July 28th, those on duty at Mao Zedong's quarters were Wang Dongxing, Wang Hongwen, and Mao Zedong's confidential secretary, Zhang Yufeng.
bolt12_10511_2891.5
In the early hours of the morning, with the clock hands pointing to 3:42, the ground of Zhongnanhai suddenly started to shudder.
bolt12_10511_2891.6
In Mao Zedong's residence, the glass window in the foyer door rattled uncontrollably, and there was a huge bang from below like a tractor starting up, with Mao Zedong's sickbed shaking non-stop.......
bolt12_10511_2891.7
While Mao Zedong was convalescing, the employees and medical staff around him were all in a state of high tension, maintaining extremely silent surroundings and atmosphere.
bolt12_10511_2891.8
In normal times, apart from the talking and noise of medical instruments when the doctors revived him, not a whisper could be heard.
bolt12_10511_3031.1
After the nineties, state-owned engineering enterprises stopped recruiting construction workers.
bolt12_10511_3031.2
But that isn't to say they stopped hiring people, but those they took in were all graduates with professional diplomas from polytechnic schools, technical colleges, and universities; these staff all went into management.
bolt12_10511_3031.3
During the early nineties, the formal employees of this enterprise still had complete working teams, such as bricklaying teams, woodwork teams, steel reinforcement teams, and machinery maintenance teams, but since they could not cope with a large volume of project tasks, they were already cooperating with some migrant worker units, in other words the familiar "contracting gangs".
bolt12_10511_3031.4
A collision occurred between tradition and reality.
bolt12_10511_3031.5
Due to formal working units no longer taking on young employees, working units got increasingly older and broken up.
bolt12_10511_3031.6
Some staff (extremely few) entered management.
bolt12_10511_3031.7
A few exceptional former team leaders gradually became project managers.
bolt12_10511_3031.8
Others became materials officers, safety officers and quality control officers, etc.
bolt12_10511_3031.9
Those without connections became staff monitoring the construction site------similar to the security guards of today.
bolt12_10511_3031.10
The workers no longer formed complete operating teams.
bolt12_10511_3031.11
And at this time, migrant worker units gained an opportunity to develop.
bolt12_10511_3031.12
The entire on-site operation work was all carried out by contracting gangs.
bolt12_10511_3031.13
Working units disbanded.
bolt12_10511_3031.14
The status of these workers was also changing.
bolt12_10511_6531.1
The corrupt mentality that treating dinner and gift-giving is necessary for getting things done is deeply rooted in the minds of people from all walks of society.
bolt12_10511_6531.2
In each case of corruption, those power-wielding bureaucrats, those scholars or technicians who have cornered the market in their fields, those capitalists with vast wealth, they are the ruling force of this society, and also the ones who profit from the corruption.
bolt12_10511_6531.3
The powerless, pennyless working public with no access to information technology resources %PW are the ones who lose out from the corruption.
bolt12_10511_6531.4
Today's society is corrupt in every direction, and the direct cause is the reinstatement of private ownership and the scrapping of the public supervision of the Mao Zedong era.
bolt12_10511_6531.5
In privatized societies, everybody tramples over others trying to maximize their own interests.
bolt12_10511_6531.6
Doctors who don't receive 'red envelopes' have no motivation to properly cure the patient.
bolt12_10511_6531.7
Teachers openly ask students to give them gifts,

gang ringleaders use cash to have the media make them out as heroes,

capitalists trying to annex state-owned property team up with scholars and academically demonstrate state-owned monopolies to be the reason behind corruption, and then reap in the profits.
bolt12_10511_6531.10
Frequently the public, under the guidance of the mainstream media, only concern themselves with administrative and judicial corruption; this in itself is a type of corruption.

Do commodity prices have a base value worth talking about?
bolt12_10511_6782.2
Do commodities have a true value?

These are already elements of uncertainty.
bolt12_10511_6782.4
With things, less is more; sell as much as you want, as long as somebody will buy.
bolt12_10511_6782.5
In fact, in a socialist country one cannot act in that way.
bolt12_10511_6782.6
In the area of profiting from commodities, there have been no systems in place and no legal provisions ever since the reforms, there is no last word on how many multiples of cost profits are allowed to be, or what percentage.
bolt12_10511_6782.7
China's self-sufficient, natural economy was not without any advantages. At least it didn't try to reap large profits off its own people,
bolt12_10511_6782.8
now the exact opposite is the case.
bolt12_10511_6782.9
A home appliance - whether you are Chinese or a foreigner, which regional category you fit in, whether you are a big city or a small city, whether you are a worker or a peasant - is always the same price.
bolt12_10511_6782.10
Not knowing how much profit is in there, not caring who can afford it and who can't, these do not seem to be the principles of socialism.
bolt12_10511_6782.11
And with farmers' grain and rural products, if the country doesn't wipe out agricultural taxes and doesn't offer any subsidies, keeping on producing is a problem.
bolt12_10511_6782.12
In order to improve the people's living standards, the government set things so that grain is always the same price whether sold to big cities or to rich people.
bolt12_10511_6782.13
With this kind of ratio in existence, in struggling areas trying for a comfortable life is very difficult.

This issue should attract the close attention of economists.
bolt12_10511_7302.1
December 26, 1975, Mao Zedong had his 82th birth day, his last one.
bolt12_10511_7302.2
Upon turning 80, Mao Zedong felt apparently that he was old and would die soon.
bolt12_10511_7302.3
Therefore, around his birthday those few years, Mao Zedong had always talked about life and death from time to time.
bolt12_10511_7302.4
One thing he often said was: "73 and 84 are ages at which you will be gone even if the King of Hell doesn't call you."
bolt12_10511_7302.5
Also since he turned 80, people had been paying more and more attention to Mao Zedong's birthday.
bolt12_10511_7302.6
Within the country, people dared not celebrate his birthday publicly, so they would celebrate quietly at home.
bolt12_10511_7302.7
Local governments dared not present gifts to Mao Zedong, but would convey their blessings to Mao Zedong in various ways.
bolt12_10511_7302.8
In the years before Mao Zedong passed away, his hometown Hunan would specially send things like long life noodles on December 26 every year.
bolt12_10511_7302.9
For this, Mao Zedong had accepted with pleasure, which was quite unusual.

Despite Microsoft's status as the globe's most financially endowed high-tech leader, bargaining with Microsoft is something that is sure to leave you greatly disillusioned.

Microsoft's dictionary has never contained the word "generous".
bolt12_10737_1991.3
So when the Jerry Yangs hope that by bargaining they can bump up Microsoft's purchase price, they are being very unrealistic.
bolt12_10737_1991.4
Microsoft raising its price ever so slightly already represented a big concession, proving that it really does want to get its hands on Yahoo!.

Right from the start, this was a super acquisition that lacked bite; despite the numbers being huge, even if the acquisition was successful, truly revolutionizing the framework of the Internet was simply not possible.
bolt12_10737_1991.7
However, when the acquisition did fall through, it was also quite disappointing.
bolt12_10737_1991.8
To us global observers watching the bustling scene, giving up the acquisition was like a play stopped abruptly halfway through, without ever getting the chance to watch the rest of the fun, and indeed there was no shortage of theatrical transformations.
bolt12_10737_1991.9
We have no choice but to return back to our mundane lives, and wait for this increasingly passion-destroying industry to come up with the next affair of note.
bolt12_12119_4191.1
Since last September, when his daughter was diagnosed with symptoms such as bloody feces and kidney stones, Zhou Jin has been in succession to Yongzhou in Hunan, Hebei, Xiamen, Beijing, Guangzhou, and more to take his daughter to hospitals for treatment, but the child's illness has continued to improve and decline.
bolt12_12119_4191.2
This September, Zhou Jin, working in Shenzhen, took his daughter to the Shenzhen Children's Hospital for examination and treatment.
bolt12_12119_4191.3
The results of the examination are that the upper rectum was severely infected and the right kidney expanded. The kidney stone found in previous hospital treatments was not found this time.
bolt12_12119_4191.4
Zhou Jin said that his daughter, a little over two years old this year, had eaten Sanlu milk powder for over a year. Last September after the bloody feces appeared, family members took his daughter to the Yongzhou hospital for examination. The doctors informed them that "there is no better treatment method, just have her drink more water."
bolt12_12119_4191.5
Worrying about his daughter's illness, Zhou Jin asked the county hospital to issue a certificate to transfer her to another hospital, to let his daughter go to a better hospital for treatment.
bolt12_12119_4191.6
The hospital Medical Administration Department told Zhou Jin that issuing of the certificate to transfer to another hospital would require the approval of the Ministry of Health, and more than one month would be needed.
bolt12_12119_4191.7
"I went repeatedly to find the relevant health department, but they passed my case back and forth. I was helpless and could only take my daughter to the place where I work -- Xiamen, to carry out treatment."
bolt12_12120_6301.1
Have to suffer this pain.
bolt12_12120_6301.2
The doctor in charge told us that the kid would be out of danger if he could just urinate.
bolt12_12120_6301.3
Getting him to urinate couldn't be more difficult!
bolt12_12120_6301.4
This urine is more valuable than gold.
bolt12_12120_6301.5
He didn't pee at all during the first two or three days in hospital.
bolt12_12120_6301.6
We were all desperate at that time.
bolt12_12120_6301.7
The hospital already arranged for him to undergo dialysis surgery.
bolt12_12120_6301.8
And my satisfying son finally urinated.
bolt12_12120_6301.9
Out of danger at last, but one trouble passed and another one took its place, there came an acute diarrhea and fever, he was stooling several dozen times every day, you can imagine the suffering.
bolt12_12120_6301.10
He had just danced a circle around the Grim Reaper, and encounted this problem on top of that. I was really worried he wouldn't pull through.
bolt12_12120_6301.11
I don't know what was happening with the injection treatment at the hospital - the more they injected him the worse the diarrhea, nothing would stop it.
bolt12_12120_6301.12
After a few more days of treatment, the kid's diarrhea was a little better and the doctors got him to do an ultrasound.
bolt12_12120_6301.13
The kidney stone had been washed out by the medicine. There were no more stones on his kidneys.
bolt12_12120_6301.14
The hospitalization was very expensive and our family couldn't afford it, so we had no choice but to leave the hospital and go home.
bolt12_12120_6301.15
On the night of Dragon Boat Festival he passed out a stone by himself, it was a sedimentary one.

The whole family was really excited, we all thought he was better, that he was cured.

Over 200 Han pupils in 15th primary school in Urumqi were injected, *and there were actually Uyghur students from the same schools involved*, it was shocking!
bolt12_12120_6501.2
On the day of September 1st alone, at the entrance of "Longyuan Supermarket" on Urumqi's Friendship Road, two people were injected and sent to hospital.
bolt12_12120_6501.3
On the same day, in Shuimogou District, No.106 Bus had just pulled up at the Gaojiazhuang stop when several people were injected, soon, the Uyghur assailants jumped from the bus and fled, but they were soon detained after bystanders gave chase.
bolt12_12120_6501.4
The 920 and many other buses also experienced a number of poisoned syringe cases.
bolt12_12120_6501.5
On August 31, the No. 17 bus exploded near Xibei Road, while the No. 14 bus was bombed at the same time.
bolt12_12120_6501.6
Nevertheless, all news was blocked.
bolt12_12120_6501.7
But witnesses shortly after spread the news to the outside world by telephone - Urumqi security is extremely deteriorating!
bolt12_12120_6501.8
Even more ironic was in late August, when *President Hu Jintao* had just visited Xinjiang on an inspection tour. Upon his return to Beijing, the situation in Urumqi was far from settling, instead the *Uyghur terrorists* becoming even more rampant, and the numbers of attacks and bombings were increasing rather than decreasing!
bolt12_12120_6501.9
The incompetence of the Xinjiang government would make the Central extremely troublesome!

Listening to Yesterday Once More by the Carpenters, seeing the photograph album in which photos showing collages of compatriots receiving awards, I don't know when people should cry, and my heart is lost.
bolt12_12240_8611.2
After so many years can they still sing Yesterday Once More?
bolt12_12240_8611.3
Dear friends, let me fill in some of the words for the melody right now in my heart.

Don't worry, the cold-blood isn't me, it's a part of my heart.

If an Olympic Games were held taking the damage done to mankind by industrial pollution as theme, I think our dear motherland should be able to win a gold medal and a champion of winning the grand total in gold medals. I just don't know how the opening ceremony would be run, how volunteers should be recruited, or which song should be sung lustily.
bolt12_12240_8611.6
The title of the sick man of East Asia once went far away following the revolutionary course brimming with victories, but after seeing this group of photos, I feel that they have whistled back with this brand new attitude of faster, higher, stronger.
bolt12_12240_8611.7
What is different is that I dare not expect for; in what way can we have again "The Destruction of Opium at Humen" with "upholding the country's interests with one's life".
bolt12_12240_8611.8
Because we and our motherland cannot depart from this shocking pollution. What we can do is just to improve, adjust and vaguely hope.

The people who have been sacrificed have, without choice, used their lives to pave the road to success for another group of people.
bolt12_122496_9610.1
At that time, tens of thousands of city youth headed to the countryside, but by no means were all of them were true believers.
bolt12_122496_9610.2
Some were under pressure to show their "revolutionary zeal", others went because there were no jobs in the city.
bolt12_122496_9610.3
The poverty and backwardness of the countryside were appalling, and most of the educated youth became disillusioned.
bolt12_122496_9610.4
In the middle of the 1970's the intensity of the Cultural Revolution waned, and one after one the youths returned to the cities or went to study in university, but back then there wasn't an exam to get into university, it depended on your political background and behavior.
bolt12_122496_9610.5
Jianguo was not one of these. He worked for seven years in a rural part of Inner Mongolia, became a village head, and was very popular with the locals.
bolt12_122496_9610.6
He was a dab hand at working the fields, and could match the locals when it came to drinking spirits.
bolt12_122496_9610.7
He married an old school friend of his from Beijing, and she stayed behind for him, the two living their own little lives together in the country.
bolt12_122496_9610.8
Although the villagers had no interest in the various kinds of "revolutionary practices" that Jianguo tried to make them adopt, he was honest and kind, and his generous personality won their friendship and affection.
bolt12_122496_9613.1
After Jianguo had returned to Beijing for not even a few moths, the student movement in Tiananmen began.
bolt12_122496_9613.2
Jianguo went to the square to listen to speeches and singing, and watched a new generation of students be rebellious, and was shaken and moved.
bolt12_122496_9613.3
Twenty years before, the god of the "Red Guards" was Mao, but the ideal of young people now was wearing jeans and a T-shirt, and a new statue had been erected: Lady Liberty.
bolt12_122496_9613.4
At that time I lived in Beijing, and every day went to the square. When we ran into each other, Jianguo didn't say much. However it looked like he had a million thoughts stirring in his heart.
bolt12_122496_9613.5
One afternoon, I went to see an active figure in the square, and arranged to go together with him.
bolt12_122496_9613.6
Friends greeted me with smiles, and asked me to go into their tent, as a meeting of student leaders was going on inside.
bolt12_122496_9613.7
Jianguo was just behind me and had just started to come inside, when my friends frowned and stopped him: "No, you can't come inside!"
bolt12_122496_9613.8
I explained, saying this was my brother. My friends listened with surprise.
bolt12_122496_9613.9
Beijing-born and Beijing-raised Jianguo, he looked today completely like a villager from the countryside.
bolt12_12252_5013.1
Wang Peirong thinks that this is related to blockages in the usual reporting channels.
bolt12_12252_5013.2
He pointed out, all of his reports were made under the circumstances that the normal reports didn't work, and he had no choice but made reports online.
bolt12_12252_5013.3
A typical example is that the fall of Dong Feng, the most debaucherous secretary labeled as one-husband-with-two-wife in the country.
bolt12_12252_5013.4
Wang Peirong thinks that Dong Feng's absurdity and corruption was actually an open secret, but nobody investigated and penalized; and even though Wang Peirong reported on this using his real name to the concerned departments for one year, no one bothered to inquire about it.
bolt12_12252_5013.6
Wang Peirong also thinks that reporting online is equivalent to publicizing the corruptive deeds of the person being reported against. Once under the public eye, the possibility of any blatant cover-ups becomes greatly reduced, thus, making it easier to investigate and penalize.
bolt12_12255_0491.1
Many people will ask, Chargeback Rival is made by an individual, so what is the relationship with 360?
bolt12_12255_0491.2
There are likely three original reasons why 360 uses a person's name to issue Chargeback Rival:
bolt12_12255_0491.3
General manager Zhou has done too much bad stuff on PC's, and didn't want to offend too many people on cell phones, so he found an individual author to act as a scapegoat (if a cell phone SP company knew that it was 360 that block their way. Each one of them is tough.);
bolt12_12255_0491.4
Using an individual author to issue it, it was easy to defraud the grassroots netizens of their sense of identification and sympathy.
bolt12_12255_0491.5
If you see I am an individual netizen, who has been charged money, so makes a piece of software in order to help everyone solve this problem, then how moved it seems from the outside.
bolt12_12255_0491.6
Using an individual author to issue, there has been a strong power of captivation. Many companies in the SP and wireless realm would definitely think that a product from an individual author would not have much influence, so would not pay too much attention to it.
bolt12_12255_0491.7
Nevertheless, 360 already did this under cover of promoting Chargeback Rival in large scale. Once after Chargeback Rival became dominant on the situation, then it is to be transformed into 360.
bolt12_12257_2193.1
Having seen no hope from Xu Ming, Wang Peirong then could only post the relevant problems online.
bolt12_12260_1905.1
Not only that, Wang Peirong's generous and courageous endeavors have led to revenge from the reported on numerous occasions: when reporting the corruption of Li Rongqi, he was severely beaten up by hired goons; when reporting the black forces, he was retaliated by the black forces, and hospitalized for the injuries.
bolt12_12260_1905.2
But these have not been able to halt the momentum of Wang Peirong's reporting.
bolt12_12260_1905.3
However, in the program, Wang Peirong calls out to the parties and the government to set out policies and provisions to protect the personal safety and legal rights of whistle blowers.
bolt12_12260_1905.4
This program of <<News Night Banquet>> on Jiangsu TV's city channel, caused a great uproar in the community.
bolt12_12260_1905.5
But in contrast with this, Wang Peirong, well reputed as Jiangsu's "number one person in online anti-corruption", is now suffering unfair treatment.
bolt12_12260_1905.6
Because of pressure from the reported officials such as Li Rongqi, China's University of Mining and Technology has suspended Wang Peirong's teaching duties.
bolt12_12260_1905.7
How China University of Mining and Technology responds to Jiangsu mainstream media's positive and active appraisal of Wang Peirong; how well they treat Wang Peirong; and how they protect Wang Peirong's legal rights, are unavoidable questions placed in front of the Mining University's decision makers.

The Chinese defense budget for 2012 is RMB670.274 billion, increasing by RMB67.604 billion and 11.2% compared to the previous year's estimated budgetary expenditure.
bolt12_2981_0161.2
The Chinese military expenditures are increasing too fast for America, and the increase is currently over RMB100 billion, but what on earth can China do with this additional amount of more than RMB100 billion dollars?
bolt12_2981_0161.3
Based on the current exchange rate between the Renminbi and US dollar, it amounts to more than US$10 billion, which can purchase more than a hundred of the latest 3.5 generation Western fighter planes.
bolt12_2981_0161.4
If it is used to manufacture Chinese J-10 fighters, over two hundred planes can be produced, or perhaps even more. In one go, China can improve its prowess in the air by a margin even greater than the total sum of a mid-sized Western country.
bolt12_2981_0161.5
In fact, what America really fears is not the increase of military expenditure, but rather the rapid rate at which China is upgrading its military technologies, which may enable China to overtake America soon.
bolt12_2981_0161.6
Compared to America, China has many inadequacies, for instance, its high technology development is not as mature as America's, and its basic infrastructure, the standard of education of its citizens, development of its systems and so on are also lacking. However, China has its own natural advantages, and that is China possesses a long history and stability of culture.
bolt12_2981_0161.7
Some people pointed out in their comments that this is a serious disadvantage to China when compared to America, as they say that China is carrying too heavy a burden which will hinder rapid development,
bolt12_2981_0161.8
in fact, this reasoning is extremely incorrect, the Chinese culture is profound, so whatever problems the country may face, it can draw on its historic experiences,
bolt12_2981_0161.9
for instance, when China deals with international affairs, it can learn from how the Yuan Dynasty handled foreign trade and the problems of co-existence between multiple ethnic groups, or it could at least draw a lesson from the negative experiences.
bolt12_2981_0161.10
Currently America is drastically cutting down on its military expenditure, however it fears that China will substantially increase its military expenditure. America is desperately attempting to return to the Pacific Ocean as it wishes to continue to contain the growth of Chinese military strength,
bolt12_2981_0161.11
America controls the Straits of Malacca, and a large majority of China's shipping vessels are under its control. However if America wishes to maintain the development of world trade order, its expenses will naturally be enormous.
bolt12_2981_0161.12
If it were not for the financial crisis, a number of Western countries have stated that they would not have considered budgetary issues for American military deployments.
bolt12_2981_0161.13
As a matter of fact, neighboring countries need not be too sensitive to the sharp increase in Chinese military spending. They fear that China will pose a direct threat to them, but Chinese history has shown that China has never had the habit of wielding its military might to challenge Western countries, but as for how they habitually view China will depend on the profound influence of the Chinese culture.
bolt12_2981_0161.14
China does not like to show off, preferring to restrain itself, and the same is true in the field of military matters.
bolt12_2981_0161.15
Up to now, China revealed that it has three models of the 4th generation stealth fighter planes under research and development, and the J20 is expected to enter mass production and service next year, which is a direct blow to America,
bolt12_2981_0161.16
however, what is even more terrifying for America is that this Chinese fighter plane model has already displayed surprisingly advanced performance during combat, and it is feared that its level of technological advancement cannot be matched by the F22. After all, this model of fighter plane has never participated in actual inspections up to this point.
bolt12_2981_0161.17
Perhaps this is understandable for China, but it is inevitable that the 4th generation Chinese fighter plane would create a stir.
bolt12_2981_0161.18
The original order has been disrupted. After all, the Chinese fighter is no less powerful than the American one.
bolt12_2981_0161.19
According to American media reports, China's military expenditures are expected to reach US$200 billion in two years' time,
bolt12_2981_0161.20
Of course there is a strong possibility that this number has been greatly exaggerated, and it is also embellished by the China Threat theory. However, such moves by America no longer has much effect on China, even if the Chinese defense expenditures reach US$200 billion, America cannot do anything to China,
bolt12_2981_0161.21
Recently, China adopted an aggressive stance, casting negative votes on the Syria issue three times, and in relation to Japan's naming of the Diaoyu Islands, Beijing appears to be sending a message that 'we have accumulated sufficient power, and we are not afraid of your distortions of the truth.'
bolt12_2981_0161.22
The Chinese military expenditures are soaring. By contrast, America is continuously cutting down on its military expenditures, repeatedly asserting that its prowess will be replaced by small but elite troops that will not affect its capabilities. As it is nothing more than self-consolation, therefore, it caused widespread concern throughout America.
bolt12_2981_0161.23
Certainly, this is clearly a refurbished version of the 'military threat theory' from America, and it is now changed to a 'threat by military expenditure theory', however, China is used to finger-wagging and criticism from America, and as China grows increasingly confident, this writer believes that America will terminate its friendly economic relations with China soon or later,
bolt12_2981_0161.24
China's soaring military expenditures imply that China is reluctant to be limited to a position as the world's No. 2, and nor is it content to be world No. 1 in name only. Instead, it intends to recover its historical 1,500-year glory as the leader of the world.

Faced with rascals and hooligans like the Americans, the Chinese have no choice but to arm themselves.
bolt12_2981_0167.1
Indeed. I wonder what our military expenditure is like in proportion to America's, and besides how much of our military expenditure is genuinely spent on sophisticated national defenses, if it is really spent on advanced defenses, there will never be such a thing as too much! Compared to America we are still lagging far behind!

Now that Vice President Xi has visited America, the direction for the Sino-American relationship has become the focus of world attention.

But no matter how sweetly imperialist America talks, I have no hope for imperialist America.
bolt12_2981_5391.3
Imperialist America has always been a country failing to live up to its words, and as long as something is in its interests, it will spare no effort and use any means to get it.
bolt12_2981_5391.4
The relationship between China and imperialist America is like that between the sheep and the wolf, and don't expect the wolf to change its ambition,
bolt12_2981_5391.5
the wolf and the sheep can never be friends, even if so, it's only an illusion on our part, it's only a wolf in sheep's clothing.
bolt12_2981_5391.6
Ultimately, it will reveal its wolf nature, and I hope the sheep will not be fooled by it.
bolt12_2981_5391.7
The whole world expects China and America to coexist peacefully, jointly preside over and deal with international affairs, and build a peaceful new international order.
bolt12_2981_5391.8
The peaceful coexistence of China and America is also the common wish of the people in the two countries.
bolt12_2981_5391.9
Nevertheless, the peace we aspire to will be only our good wish.
bolt12_2981_5391.10
China is the fallen petals that have the intention, but imperialist America is the heartless flowing water.
bolt12_2981_5391.11
Maintaining friendly relations with imperialist America is only the wishful thinking of some Chinese!
bolt12_2981_5391.12
Though there is a great distance between China and America and there are no territorial disputes, unlike our relationship with the Polar Bear, there is a direct conflict of interest.
bolt12_2981_5391.13
However, due to ideological difference between China and America and the lack of the necessary trust and communication in handling international affairs, it is particularly imperialist America, in its effort to contain the development of China and its threat to its hegemonic position, that makes trouble wherever possible to constrain the takeoff of the Chinese dragon.
bolt12_2981_5391.14
Actually, imperialist America has the initiative in terms of whether the two major countries, China and America can get along,
bolt12_2981_5391.15
China has done a lot, and sacrificed a lot, for the Sino-American relationship,
bolt12_2981_5391.16
out of its wishful thinking, China uses its warm face to caress the cold ass of imperialist America, but it is still unable to win imperialistic America's sincerity, causing the Sino-American relationship to waver and even fall backwards.
bolt12_2981_5391.17
In future times, as China challenges its world hegemony and imperialist America attempts to retain it, more clashes will happen, conflicts will be inevitable, and the struggle will become ever more ferocious.
bolt12_2981_5391.18
In recent years, as China's reform and opening-up campaign has reached greater depths, the people's living standards have improved substantially, and its defense and military strength has also developed rapidly.
bolt12_2981_5391.19
The status of China as a major world power has begun to be more prominent, and in dealing with and directing international affairs, China has played an ever more important role.
bolt12_2981_5391.20
China's rapid growth and rise has gradually threatened and challenged the hegemonic position of imperialist America.
bolt12_2981_5391.21
This makes imperialist America restless, and it has devised every possible means to contain and check China's development.
bolt12_2981_5391.22
Imperialist America wants to upset and restrain China with its military sales to Taiwan and the Taiwan issue!
bolt12_2981_5391.23
The Taiwan issue has become an everlasting sorrow in the hearts of all descendants of China.
bolt12_2981_5391.24
Imperialist America wants to control the Middle East and suppress Syria and Iran mainly because it covets the important strategic location and abundant resources of the Middle East.
bolt12_2981_5391.25
Imperialist America wants to overthrow the Bashar regime to get rid of the Polar Bear's only military base in the Middle East! It does not want the influence of the Polar Bear to exist in the Middle East region over the long term.
bolt12_2981_5391.26
Imperialist America wants to topple Iran mainly to take on China, to control China's resources and contain China's development.
bolt12_2981_5391.27
In addition, it also wants to suppress the Polar Bear and squeeze the living space of China and Russia.
bolt12_2981_5391.28
In today's world, the only countries that can constitute a threat to the hegemonic position of imperialist America are China and, to a lesser degree, the Polar Bear.
bolt12_2981_5391.29
Imperialist America has had far-reaching strategic foresight, and each step it takes serves to consolidate its hegemony.
bolt12_2981_5391.30
Imperialist America is suppressing China in an all-round way, and we can see imperialist America's meddling presence in the economy, politics and military affairs.
bolt12_2981_5391.31
Imperialist America has been supporting little Japan, India, the Philippine servants and the Vietnamese monkeys, disturbing the stable environment around China to disrupt the peaceful development and rise of China.
bolt12_2981_5391.32
Imperialist America is now pompously returning to the Asia Pacific region and reshuffling its military deployment, directly targeting China.
bolt12_2981_5391.33
Taiwan is the deepest pain for all Chinese, because imperialist America has long taken Taiwan as a pawn and used it as a bargaining chip in the struggle with China.
bolt12_2981_5391.34
It's a pity that many Chinese are still hoping to make friends with imperialist America and maintain a friendship with imperialist America from generation to generation.
bolt12_2981_5391.35
Furthermore, the many strategic adjustments and ideas of imperialist America are all aimed at the rising China.
bolt12_2981_5391.36
Many advanced weapons have been tailor-made for China.

Imperialist America takes China as its prime rival and enemy, give up your fantasy that you can make friends with the enemy!
bolt12_2981_5391.39
The best method is to make good use of our time to step up our own defense and military construction, cast away all the illusions, and get ready for war!
bolt12_2981_5391.40
Our ancestors wisely said, "Harbor no ill intention against others, but never relax one's vigilance"!
bolt12_2981_5391.41
This is the necessary psychology for getting along with friends, but at this moment imperialist America is our enemy staring like a tiger watching its prey, making it more necessary for us to remain vigilant at this time!

China has made a lot of sacrifices to improve its relations with imperialist America, and China has all along tried to become friends with imperialist America,

although China now needs a peaceful and stable environment for its development, we can't make continual investments without any return.
bolt12_2981_5391.44
Can Sino-American relations be improved? Is friendly development possible? The key question lies with imperialist America, not China.
bolt12_2981_5391.45
Imperialist America has always held the initiative in the development of Sino-American relations.
bolt12_2981_5391.46
In fact, it is not difficult for China and America to become friends, because China and America, despite their ideological differences, have no land or territorial disputes.
bolt12_2981_5391.47
Though China and America have fought each other on the battlefield, the wars were not directly between China and America.
bolt12_2981_5391.48
If imperialist America sincerely wants to make friends with China, it must display its sincerity and let the Chinese people see actual actions and results.
bolt12_2981_5391.49
For China, the greatest interest concerning imperialist America lies in the Taiwan issue.
bolt12_2981_5391.50
If imperialist America can stop its military sales to Taiwan, provide no support to Taiwan, and ensure peace across the Taiwan Straits, it will allow China to accomplish its great cause of national reunification.
bolt12_2981_5391.51
If it refrains from meddling in China's internal human rights issues, and also does not intervene in other affairs such as Tibet, I believe that China will also sacrifice its other interests to reciprocate the good faith of imperialist America!
bolt12_2981_5391.52
Only if imperialist America does this can China and America truly become friends and co-exist peacefully as friends from generation to generation.
bolt12_2981_5391.53
Will imperialist America give up Taiwan? Absolutely not!
bolt12_2981_5391.54
Being used to being a hegemon, imperialist America likes to intervene in the internal affairs and human rights affairs of other countries, and Taiwan is the best chess piece for containing China, so I believe imperialist America will not easily let go of it!
bolt12_2981_5391.55
There is even less possibility that it will tolerate a Chinese challenge to its position as the world hegemon!
bolt12_2981_5391.56
In the years to come, instead of becoming friends, China and America will only become rivals and even enemies!
bolt12_2981_5391.57
Therefore, it's unnecessary to harbor any fantasies about imperialist America, China should fundamentally change its mentality, there is no need to fear imperialist America, and we should be ready for a military confrontations with imperialist America at any time.
bolt12_2981_5391.58
Let's win the respect of imperialist America and the whole world with our strength.
bolt12_2981_5391.59
A peaceful rise is only our unilateral notion, because the big powers of the world will not accept the appearance of a powerful China.
bolt12_2981_5391.60
Only baptized by war can China really become a world power.
bolt12_2981_5391.61
The Chinese should be ever vigilant and not be deceived by the present peace, active war preparation is the only right choice,
bolt12_2981_5391.62
only when our defense and military have become strong, will we be able to eradicate all aggressors, and only through the baptism of war can China become a truly powerful country.
bolt12_2981_5391.63
In my personal opinion, there must be a war between China and America in the future!
bolt12_2981_5391.64
What China needs to do is to cast away its illusions and get ready for war.

China Mobile is no doubt a monopolized operator in China, the biggest mobile phone market in the world. It has also expressed clearly its ambition to step outside the country and participate in global competitions.

Even though the performances of Chinese companies are not outstanding in the course of globalization, Wang Jianzhou, President and CEO of China Mobile, is determined to change all this.

On the eve of the Business Week CEO Forum held in Beijing on November 1, Wang Jianzhou gave an exclusive interview to the editor of the Business Week.

He stated that the objective of China Mobile is to become a world-class company.

Wang Jianzhou, 57, said in fluent English that China Mobile, which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has close to 300 million mobile phone users in mainland China, an equivalent of the entire population of the United States.

Children of the rich and government officials, who doesn't want to enhance their status through overseas study?

Let alone that getting oneself a western diploma will make getting a good job easier in the future. Even old dad and mom making a parade of it everywhere would look exceedingly good!

However, those in middle class families or even laid-off workers see those children of the wealthy and powerful go overseas, come back cloaked in glory and all have a good future (they don't know that family wealth and good backgrounds of those are the only real guarantees). How wonderful! Thereupon, they pinch and scrape to send their child overseas,
bolt12_3492_6281.5
It seems that once they are sent overseas, nothing but a wonderful future and unlimited glory will return.
bolt12_3492_6281.6
Nowadays, it is more often the case that those who don't pass the university entrance exam and are wasting their days at home without doing anything are sent overseas. With a bit of "toughening up", everything will be okay.

As known to all, Shanghai and Hong Kong have very low birth rates and mainly depend on migrants to maintain their population sizes and keep their populations young; there is good economic development;

In recent years, due to labor shortages, millions of black people and Southeast Asians have come to the southeast, and have caused varied degrees of deterioration in social order.
bolt12_39887_6417.3
Just like Shanghai and Hong Kong, China depends on immigrants and at the same time pursues the one-child policy, making the planning policy look like a very clever policy!

bolt12_39887_6417.6
Before long, the dividends for the population would wear out. As immigrant laborers swarmed in (these people are not subject to family planning), the population would soon experience racial replacement, and China, as Yugoslavia did, would soon disintegrate!

bolt12_39887_6417.13
But the Chinese nation will be on the brink of extinction. Such selfless notions which nobody will have until evolving into a nonhuman creature, surprisingly, has become a reality in China!

Improving Population Quality Requires Transferring Reproduction Rights to the Rich?
bolt12_3988_7641.2
Through free exchanges on the market, nearly everything can be bought and sold.
bolt12_3988_7641.3
Today, the right to bear a second child is also becoming a popular product with the rich.
bolt12_3988_7641.4
They have money to buy the right, to bear the child, and to raise the child.
bolt12_3988_7641.5
As to these transfers and transactions of the right to bear a second child, let's have a look at how the representatives argued and legally struggled with government officials at the " Two Meetings".
bolt12_3988_7641.6
Why did they propose such a transfer on the right to bear a second child?
bolt12_3988_7641.7
To this question, Li Xinghao-the author of this proposal, NPC representative and Chairman of Zhigao Group, said that such a transfer is beneficial to improving the quality of the population.
bolt12_3988_7641.8
Transferred to which kind of person, exactly?
bolt12_3988_7641.9
This representative identified 3 groups: First, people with strong educational backgrounds; second, the rich class; third, civil servants.
bolt12_3988_7641.10
Li Xinghao asserts that "In today's society, people with strong educational backgrounds, the rich class, and civil servants have relatively high social status, relatively good economics means, and can ensure basic educational conditions and a good environment for the newborn population to develop in".
bolt12_3988_7641.11
Why is such transfer practical?
bolt12_3988_7641.12
Li Xinghao gave his own specific explanation from the angle of market supply and demand.
bolt12_3988_7641.13
He said, "For a transfer, people are not classified into the rich and the poor, but into those who have a demand and those who do not.
bolt12_3988_7641.14
He said that the original motive for this proposal was rooted in his discovery that some families legally allowed to bear a second child, due to their poverty and other reasons, would become even more impoverished if they were to do so;
bolt12_3988_7641.15
while some rich families had a strong desire to bear a second child but did not have the allowance to do so.
bolt12_3988_7641.16
He thinks that this conflict really exists, and the relevant governmental departments can take the initiative to establish a transfer platform."
bolt12_3988_7641.17
This transfer proposal by Representative Li is indeed very smart.
bolt12_3988_7641.18
On the one hand, it helps the government to reduce and narrow the gap of wealth;
bolt12_3988_7641.19
on the other hand, it also solves the structural conflict of the reproduction right market-the poor have allowances but cannot afford the birth and upbringing, while the rich want to bear children but don't have the allowance.
bolt12_3988_7641.20
Based on Representative Li's proposal, the rich will voluntarily reduce their per capita wealth by bearing and raising more children, while the poor will increase their per capita wealth by bearing and raising fewer children.
bolt12_3988_7641.21
Through such transfers and transactions of the right to bear a second child between the rich and the poor, the government can unnoticeably narrow the ever-increasing gap between the poor and the rich without spending a single cent.
bolt12_3988_7641.22
How can the wealth gap be narrowed through such transfer?
bolt12_3988_7641.23
This Representative Li has envisioned a fast track for the get-rich-first people to guide and assist the get-rich-later people. That is, "the allowance transferee shall give the transferor 'an entire sequence' of help and support."
bolt12_3988_7641.24
"According to Li Xinghao's plan, through lottery-type drawing, the transfer platform establishes a one-on-one guidance and assistance relationship between the transferee and the transferor.
bolt12_3988_7641.25
As part of the assistance, the couple applying for the allowance to be transferred in to them will buy the transferring couple all the basic insurances currently required by the government, including social insurance, medical insurance, and personal accident insurance, and will continue to provide them with a minimum living guarantee for the rest of their lives.
bolt12_3988_7641.26
Meanwhile, the applicant couple will also provide financial support for the education of the transferring couple's child until he or she graduates from university.
bolt12_3988_7641.27
What's more, if the transferring couple intend to register as permanent urban residents, the applicant couple shall buy them a 35m2 socially subsidized apartment in the city where the applicants dwell, but all of the transferring couple's land use rights in the countryside will belong to the applicant couple."
bolt12_3988_7641.28
What do our family planning officials think of this proposal that the State "utilize the transferring of rights to bear a second-child to improve the population quality and make the get-rich-first help the get-rich-later so as to realize common prosperity"?
bolt12_3988_7641.29
In response, "Yesterday, Zhang Feng, Director of Guangdong Provincial Family Planning Commission, made his stance clear to the media that the right to reproduce is absolutely not transferrable.
bolt12_3988_7641.30
In the event that the right to reproduce is transferred, it would not only be a violation of law, but also bring moral questions if it involved a transaction."
bolt12_3988_7641.31
Through transferring their right to bear a second child and the concomitant obligations imposed on the transferees, the poor can get rich with the guidance and assistance from the get-rich-first class, if the proposal can pass and become law, the poor undoubtedly have found in the rich class, well-educated class, and the bureaucratic class an obedient son to provide for them up until they die. Marvelous indeed.
bolt12_3988_7641.32
He claims it is not a transaction, but how can it be otherwise? In this bundle of obligations for common prosperity, where is the dignity of the poor?
bolt12_3988_7641.33
Does not the bundle of obligations proposed by this Representative Li still imply a contract on the exchange and transaction of land use rights?
bolt12_3988_7641.34
Certainly, without such exchange of interests, why would the rich take an interest in providing for the children of the poor?
bolt12_3988_7641.35
If the legislature really wants to adopt this proposal on the premise of the get-rich-first class leading the get-rich-later class to become rich by giving them one-on-one guidance and assistance so as to improve our population quality and narrow our wealth gap, it must ensure fairness in such exchange of interests and during the transfer.

For a transfer of the right to marry, people are not classified into the rich and the poor, but into those who have a demand and those who do not. Since I discovered that some men who have a legal right to marry, due to their poverty and other reasons, would become even more impoverished if they did marry;
bolt12_3988_7645.2
while some rich men have a strong desire to marry N concubines (because their mistresses often fuss about wanting to get married) but they do not have the allowance, and would be guilty of bigamy.
bolt12_3988_7645.3
I think that this conflict really exists, and the relevant governmental departments can take the initiative to establish a platform to transfer the right to marry.

A pack of luxury cigarettes ranges from as little as a few tens of yuan to more than a hundred yuan, if you smoke a stick, you are puffing away one month's salary for an ordinary worker.

If it was bought with public funds, it may be said that what they are smoking are not cigarettes but the "blood and sweat" of the taxpayers.
bolt12_3988_8881.3
NPC Representative Ma Wenfang proposed that consumption of tobacco products on public expenses should be universally banned.
bolt12_3988_8881.4
There are of course many reasons as to why we lag far behind in meeting our tobacco control objectives.
bolt12_3988_8881.5
But one of the undisputable reasons is that a huge smoker's group exists within our huge contingent of civil servants.
bolt12_3988_8881.6
Among this legion of smokers, a considerable number smoke "free cigarettes" which they don't have to buy with their own money, as they were received as gifts or bought with public funds.
bolt12_3988_8881.7
It is precisely because they are not using their own money that they usually smoke luxury cigarettes which are unaffordable for most people.
bolt12_3988_8881.8
Their track performance for blowing smoke rings also has a compounding effect in repeatedly setting new records for consumption expenses by civil servants, and it has become an organic portion of officialdom corruption as a whole.
bolt12_3988_8881.9
It was precisely this horrifying social backdrop that prompted NPC Representative Ma Wenfang to solemnly set forth her proposal that consumption of tobacco products on public funds be universally banned.
bolt12_3988_8881.10
In our country, there are many civil servants who think their family name is "Gong" and such that every expense incurred by them, regardless of whether it is for public or private purpose, should be borne by the public. Therefore, consumption on public expenses can involve almost everything imaginable.
bolt12_3988_8881.11
For instance, besides luxury cigarettes, other examples include luxury liquor, fine wining and dining, luxury cars, and overseas tours, and whatever luxury enjoyment and extravagant entertainment they can imagine, they would want to have them all and enjoy them to fullest, using public funds to settle the bill in full.
bolt12_3988_8881.12
If the supreme authorities had to draw up separate regulatory documents to address every single item for consumption on public expenses for nationwide circulation in order to check such extravagances, the mountain of documents will really extend towards the sky.
bolt12_3988_8881.13
In fact, all that needs to be done is to clearly include tobacco products within the anti-corruption regulations' relevant clauses for prohibition of consumption on public funds, and it will suffice.
bolt12_3988_8881.14
As for the remaining issues, we must ensure that the orders and prohibitions are fully enforced. If any civil servant dares to violate the law, he will be severely punished according to the law and regulations.
bolt12_3988_8881.15
If this was really carried out in all localities at every level, there would be no cause to worry that the corrupt practice of consumption on public expenses, including smoking on public funds, cannot be curbed.

After deputies and committee members have moved into their quarters in the hotel, how would service staff greet them?
bolt12_3990_8771.2
Some greet them with "Deputy So-and-so" or "Committee Member So-and-so;" while some call NPC deputies "chief," which makes some deputies, especially deputies from the grass-roots level, feel somewhat embarrassed. Some deputies even request service staff to "not call me chief."
bolt12_3990_8771.3
Calling deputies and committee members who have moved into their quarters in the hotel "chief" is, of course, out of the hotel service staff member's formal respect, but it has actually caused misunderstanding of the identity of deputy or committee member.
bolt12_3990_8771.4
As major national events, the convening of the two conferences has clearly provided the path ahead for our development.
bolt12_3990_8771.5
However, at the two conferences, according to common sense, the identity of "deputy" or "committee member" is generally used, that is, "Deputy xx" or "Committee Member xx." But I cannot say much for the mention of "deputy as a chief."
bolt12_3990_8771.6
Through the subtlety of greeting, we can see common people's sense of awe towards "deputies" and "committee members."
bolt12_3990_8771.7
Actually, when providing services to deputies and committee members, what's wrong with being a bit simple?
bolt12_3990_8771.8
Wouldn't it appear more cordial to directly greet them as "Deputy xx" or "Committee Member xx?"
bolt12_3990_8771.9
After greeting them as chiefs, don't you have a sense of awe and awkwardness?
bolt12_3990_8771.10
As deputies, they should equally treasure their own first identity. Deputy or committee member is neither an administrative official post nor a honorary title. This identity means enormous responsibility.
bolt12_3990_8771.11
At the "times of the two conferences," deputies and committee members should have an even heightened sense of responsibility. No matter what kind of social status you yourself have, remember firmly your own first identity and most important identity is a deputy, a committee member.
bolt12_3990_8771.12

At present, public expenditure on food and entertainment nationwide has already reached 300 billion a year.

Such a huge figure for public expenditure on food and entertainment crowds out expenditure on things vital for people's welfare, including education, hygiene, healthcare, and social security.
bolt12_3991_0111.7
Figures listed in a bill drawn up by the Jiusan Society's central organization before the two conference in 2012
bolt12_3991_0111.8
are really unbelievable: annual public expenditure on food and entertainment actually reaches 300 billion! How large is this figure of 300 billion?
bolt12_3991_0111.9
If we saved this 300 billion and invested it in the economically undeveloped and impoverished regions in China, how many schools could we build?

How many poor families could we assist? How many children forced to leave school could we assist?

Not only could they get more than they bargained for; if something went wrong, they could end up in prison, or even endanger their lives.
bolt12_3991_0111.14
Every year, there are cases across the country where ordinary people, because of reporting government officials, suffer the disaster of imprisonment if they get up lightly or the disaster of death if they are dealt with harshly.
bolt12_3991_0111.15
It is common for ordinary people, with no other means of redress, to post on the Internet out of resentment against savage land requisitions or the savage demolition of homes and forced relocation by local government officials, but what fate do they often bring on themselves?
bolt12_3991_0111.16
Local government officials easily pin some labels on you, and you can even be chased and arrested by public security bodies across provincial boundaries.
bolt12_3991_0111.17
The most terrible thing is not the government officials, but the power that lies in the hands of these officials.

How can we prevent the "three types of consumption on public funds?"
bolt12_3991_0111.19
If we are to prevent the "three types of consumption on public funds," we must first "block" the officials' mouths,
bolt12_3991_0111.20
but this is easier said than done. Why?
bolt12_3991_0111.21
As people working in a lower-level work unit, if leaders from higher-level work units come, do you dare not to entertain them in the most respectful way with nice things to eat and drink?
bolt12_3991_0111.22
If they are not entertained well with nice things to eat and drink, after they've gone, will officials in the lower-level work unit still have a future?
bolt12_3991_0111.23
To their subordinates, senior leaders are all their "masters." You can't afford to upset any of them, and whoever upsets them is in for it. If you rub them up the wrong way when you're trying to butter them up, you won't just jeopardize your official position, you won't even know what the consequences will be.
bolt12_3991_0111.24
To stop the "three types of consumption on public funds," senior officials must first "block" their own mouths.
bolt12_3991_0111.25
In April 2011, when the no. 6 inspection group of Hubei's provincial party committee went to Yichang city on an inspection tour of Zigui county, a national-level impoverished county, the local government officials were both delighted and worried.
bolt12_3991_0111.26
What delighted them was that they had an opportunity to report their problems to senior leaders and have them taken seriously by them, and what worried them was that there were 13 people in the inspection group, coming for 20 days or so, and the entertainment expenses, the cost of the gifts, and the inspection fees and various other items of expenditure would altogether come to 801,900 yuan.
bolt12_3991_0111.27
How could this national-level impoverished county pay the bills?
bolt12_3991_0111.28
This example is the best illustration that if we are to prevent the "three types of consumption on public funds," we must first stop the senior government officials.
bolt12_3991_0111.29
If the upper beams are correctly placed, the lower beams will not go awry.
bolt12_3991_0111.30
If the central state authorities are to stop the "three types of consumption on public funds," they must dare to do what they mean.
bolt12_3991_0321.1
It should be said that wining and dining on public funds as pointed out by scholars is an objective reality.
bolt12_3991_0321.2
With the increasing prevalence of the alcohol culture at the grass-roots institutions, alcohol has already been fermented and adulterated by the so-called "bureaucratic culture" beyond recognition.
bolt12_3991_0321.3
Some people put on high-end wine banquets trying to please their superiors, some people use alcohol as gifts to seek personal gain, some people consider it a type of pleasure to get people to drink by using beer games, and some people get carried away because of their addiction to alcohol or drunkenness, adversely affecting their work.
bolt12_3991_0321.4
Every year the amounts of food trashed and money wasted as a result of wining and dining on public funds are even more appalling.
bolt12_3991_0321.5
This writer has lived for a long time at the grass-roots level and often heard and witnessed some grass-roots officials almost sitting at meal gatherings or attending banquets every day, and never getting tired of it.
bolt12_3991_0321.6
How much is the wining and dining expense at the grass-roots level in one year? A specific number is virtually never published.
bolt12_3991_0321.7
Actually, the insiders are well aware that this is a considerably high expenditure.
bolt12_3991_0321.8
Who should be blamed for the grass-roots officials' wining and dining becoming common practice?
bolt12_3991_0321.9
Speaking with regard to the grass-roots levels, it is indeed necessary to conduct rectification and to straighten things up according to the relevant regulations, but focusing on the grass-roots levels alone may not be enough.
bolt12_3991_0321.10
Throughout the year, various types of inspection groups and investigation groups, as numerous as the hairs on an ox, come and go in an endless stream, also making the grass-roots institutions overburdened. Some grass-roots leading cadres, with no choice but to run between the various dinner parties every day, also feel somewhat helpless.
bolt12_3991_0321.11
There are also many people wallowing in the array of wine glasses and poker chips becoming "vessels for wine and bags for food."
bolt12_3991_0321.12
This writer met with some township officials. Facing more and more dinner parties, many of them are fed up with it, but also feel forced and helpless.
bolt12_3991_0321.13
The reasoning they explained is that entertaining is just for solving problems.
bolt12_3991_0321.14
A township official, using his fingers to count, told this writer that in order to solve financial, road repair, canal construction projects and so on, they must entertain the relevant personnel and department heads, otherwise it will be of no avail.
bolt12_4474_0751.1
When I look back to all these years, the urban construction in Beijing has experienced rapid development.
bolt12_4474_0751.2
Some people said that it borrowed the easterly wind of the Olympics. However, I think otherwise.
bolt12_4474_0751.3
Even though the 2008 Olympics allowed Beijing to display its charisma in front of cameras of all caliber that frocked in from all sides,
bolt12_4474_0751.4
it has almost been four years since the Olympics and the urban development in Beijing still has not stopped.
bolt12_4474_0751.5
Speaking of urban development, the most representative one is none other than the Beijing subway.
bolt12_4474_0751.6
Those who were born and raised in Beijing in the 80s can almost be called the generation who grew up sitting on the subway.
bolt12_4474_0751.7
The public transportation then could not be considered as convenient compared to now. Buses could hardly be said as providing easy access to all directions.
bolt12_4474_0751.8
However, with their extensive coverage, the two subway lines provided novelty and convenience to many Beijing residents and visitors who travelled from afar.
bolt12_4474_0751.9
The subway is a distinguishing traffic feature of Beijing. As one of the first Chinese cities to have underground transportation, the emergence of subway has provided everyone more choices.
bolt12_4474_0751.10
This underground railway line that runs through eastern and western Beijing has become Beijing's symbol of alternative culture.
bolt12_4474_0751.11
Day by day, Beijing is developing, so are its public transport and highways. Eventually, it will usher in the alarming data of 5 million cars in 2012.
bolt12_4474_0751.12
Meanwhile, the crowded highways and complicated road traffic cause people to have greater expectations in the development of the subway.
bolt12_4474_0751.13
I have to applaud the continuous increase in the efforts in subway construction of Beijing in all these years when I talk about subway development.
bolt12_4474_0751.14
In July 2001, with the success in the bid to host the Olympics, Beijing subway Line 13 also ushered in the completion of the entire line and became the newest member of the Beijing subway family.
bolt12_4474_0751.15
Meanwhile, in October 2007, the closely watched subway Line 5 went into operation. It became the new trunk that links southern and northern Beijing and intersects with Line 1.
bolt12_4474_0751.16
While Beijing residents enjoyed the modernization of subway Line 5, in July 2008, the first phase of construction of subway Line 10 and in September 2009, subway Line 4 and Line 8 all became operational one after another. At the same time, all suburban districts and counties are all connected by the subway successively.
bolt12_4474_0751.17
In about 10 years time, the Beijing subway transformed from an underground supplementary means of transport that only had two lines to a 15-lined underground transportation network that covers almost the entire Beijing from Changping in the north to Daxing in the south, Mentougou in the west, and Tongzhou District in the east.
bolt12_4474_0751.18
Such rapid development was almost unimaginable by anyone and unachievable by any country.
bolt12_4474_0751.19
While 2012 is quickly approaching, there is even the spectacular scene of four lines opening at the same time. It is veritably "putting all firepower into operation"!
bolt12_4474_0751.20
The rapid coverage of underground transportation has brought along prosperity to surrounding communities of the subway. Residents no longer have to worry about which bus route to take when they go out.
bolt12_4474_0751.21
More residents gladly choose to travel by subway. It is both convenient and cozy.
bolt12_4474_0751.22
Needless to say, the subway has brought about convenience to the travel and work of the residents. More commendable is that the convenient subway has allowed more residents to give up their cars and choose such green means of transportation that is environmental friendly.
bolt12_4474_0751.23
Not only does a reduction in cars on the road alleviate traffic pressure on the road; it also reduces the pressure of air pollution so that more residents can cheer for the blue sky of Beijing from their heart.
bolt12_4474_0751.24
These are all contributions of the subway. Yet, where did the contributions of the subway come from? They were naturally from the rapid development of the subway in Beijing within these 10 years.
bolt12_4474_0751.25
The development of the subway is the same as the rapid global development of the city of Beijing, it will become a permanent city symbol of Beijing and a benefiting project that earns the satisfaction of the residents and the respect of the world.

Beijing Forces Ma Ying-jeou to Declare Stand on Unification, Taiwan Can No Longer Turn Back
bolt12_573_8171.2
It can be said that the elections that cover five major cities have stirred up a storm in Taiwan.
bolt12_573_8171.3
In the midst of all this commotion, James Soong made a sudden appearance to come head to head with Ma Ying-jeou in the elections.
bolt12_573_8171.4
This made the already worried Ma Ying-jeou even more anxious, but there is nothing he can do.
bolt12_573_8171.5
This is linked to the earlier stand mainland China made regarding military cooperation with Taiwan. In addition, James Soong has expressed clearly that his taking part in the elections is to tell Ma Ying-jeou that he had worked hard to get the 1992 Consensus from mainland China and Ma should not let everyone down.
bolt12_573_8171.6
Regarding the chaos in Taiwan and the future ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan, what else do we still need to face? What else do we have to do?
bolt12_573_8171.7
Regarding the "weathervane" of Ma Ying-jeou's stand, what other preparations should we make?
bolt12_573_8171.8
James Soong's transfer of allegiance is to force the undecided Ma Ying-jeou to declare his stand on the ultimate unification
bolt12_573_8171.9
Soong's transfer of allegiance is, in a certain sense, a kind of response to mainland China's intention.
bolt12_573_8171.10
On the issue of mainland China and Taiwan, Ma Ying-jeou has gotten a lot of room for maneuvering,
bolt12_573_8171.11
from playing the Taiwan independence card for the sake of the elections to playing the card of attacking mainland China and achieving military balance for the sake of the elections. However, on the issue of the ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan, not only did Ma Ying-jeou fail to make any progress, he even took a big step backward.
bolt12_573_8171.12
In the past, he was standing close to the middle. Now, he is starting to gradually follow the footsteps of the DPP. He keeps pushing the bottom line of mainland China for the mere sake of manipulating the elections. Furthermore, he completely ignores the compromises made by mainland China and the effort it has put in for peaceful unification.
bolt12_573_8171.13
To save the Taiwanese economy, mainland China has made huge policy adjustments such as absorbing Taiwan's excess industrial capacity, buying Taiwan's excess agricultural products, giving several Taiwanese political figures room for international affairs to carry out international affairs, etc.
bolt12_573_8171.14
However, after all this waiting, in the end it has to face Ma Ying-jeou'a a double-headed snake that is seemingly false and real at the same time.
bolt12_573_8171.15
Therefore, facing this undecided Ma Ying-jeou, James Soong stepped up to defend mainland China!
bolt12_573_8171.16
Isn't Ma Ying-jeou wanting to score more points for his selection? Isn't he wanting to elevate his position through manipulating the people?
bolt12_573_8171.17
The moment James Soong appeared, the situation changed! This is to force Ma Ying-jeou to stop manipulating the elections and declare his stand on the ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan!
bolt12_573_8171.18
Ma Ying-jeou is Not Mainland China's Only Choice, But Mainland China is Going to Be Ma Ying-jeou's Only Choice
bolt12_573_8171.19
So, what cards is Old Ma left with to play?
bolt12_573_8171.20
Military purchase - fetus died in the womb;
bolt12_573_8171.21
economic development - eclipsed by the prosperity of mainland China;
bolt12_573_8171.22
culture - fully integrated with mainland China as well;
bolt12_573_8171.23
as for military affairs - Taiwanese soldiers, whether ex-service or in service, are all under the control of mainland China's military departments.
bolt12_573_8171.24
As for the key Taiwanese figures who hold military power, mainland China has long ago convinced them with reasons.
bolt12_573_8171.25
Fellow countrymen should not slaughter one another, and brothers should not turn against one another - this makes the Taiwanese military less hostile towards mainland China.
bolt12_573_8171.26
As for the withdrawal of missiles proposed by Ma Ying-jeou, it is also no longer an issue now.
bolt12_573_8171.27
So what is Ma Ying-jeou still waiting for? For a major change to take place in Taiwan?
bolt12_573_8171.28
To mainland China, Ma Ying-jeou is no longer mainland China's only choice.
bolt12_573_8171.29
Mainland China is actively seeking all forces in Taiwan that can be sought. Even the DPP is starting to change its course.
bolt12_573_8171.30
However, Ma Ying-jeou, who is holding on and keeping his mouth tight, has no other choices except mainland China, in other words, mainland China is Ma Ying-jeou's only choice.
bolt12_573_8171.31
Basically, all the big bosses of the Kuomintang have visited mainland China and even received VIP treatment, getting all the respect they deserved.
bolt12_573_8171.32
So, is Ma Ying-jeou thinking about his future position or the great cause of the national unification?
bolt12_573_8171.33
Ma Ying-jeou might offend some people in Taiwan who are eager to achieve Taiwan independence, but Ma Ying-jeou can gain the respect of the entire Chinese population of 1.4 billion. Comparing the two, it should be clear which is important and which is not.
bolt12_573_8171.34
When Nixon visited China back then, he turned the Sino-American relationship around. So, doesn't Ma Ying-jeou want his name to go down in history?
bolt12_573_8171.35
Could it be that being the bill of a chicken is really better than being the anus of an ox?
bolt12_573_8171.36
Hence, Ma Ying-jeou should understand that he is only one of the choices of mainland China. It is up to him whether he wants to achieve success and acquire fame.
bolt12_573_8171.37
Watch out for Ma Ying-jeou's Continued Military Resistance against Unification by the Lease-to-own method
bolt12_573_8171.38
Though the United States has recently increased its military presence in the Asia Pacific region, it is showing a rare undecided stand on the Taiwan issue.
bolt12_573_8171.39
The United States is no longer able to tell where Taiwan is heading, because all Taiwanese senior politicians are talking about unification and there is less and less talk about secession.
bolt12_573_8171.40
Furthermore, a certain tacit agreement between mainland China and Taiwan regarding the Diaoyu Islands has made the United States feel somewhat unable to do what it wants to do.
bolt12_573_8171.41
However, some people from the United States and Taiwan are still somewhat intelligent.
bolt12_573_8171.42
They no longer talk about military purchase but started proposing a lease-to-own method for Taiwan to get weapons.
bolt12_573_8171.43
The weapons Taiwan has now are old.
bolt12_573_8171.44
The lease-to-own method might bring some advantages in conducting cutting-edge military confrontation with mainland China, but fundamentally speaking, Taiwan no longer has the strength to fight against mainland China.
bolt12_573_8171.45
If it continues to take its old path of resisting unification through military forces, then it will meet a very tragic ending!
bolt12_573_8171.46
Diaoyu Islands Will be a Touchstone - Taiwan Can No Longer Turn Back
bolt12_573_8171.47
Of course, there are still many opportunities for mainland China and Taiwan. For example, the Diaoyu Islands is the first touchstone of cooperation between mainland China and Taiwan.
bolt12_573_8171.48
When it comes to the Diaoyu Islands, mainland China and Taiwan can jointly deploy naval vessels, jointly defend the Diaoyu Islands, and join hands in fighting Japan.
bolt12_573_8171.49
Recently, within Taiwan, active actions have been taken concerning the ownership of Taiwan as well.
bolt12_573_8171.50
For example, there have been active changes as to how the Japan issue is treated, how the historical issue of the resistance war is treated, and how the issue of Taiwan as part of mainland China in the past is treated.
bolt12_573_8171.51
It is these changes that made the entire Taiwan, from top to bottom, reach a consensus that it can survive by staying close to mainland China.
bolt12_573_8171.52
Facing mainland China's offensive efforts towards unification, Taiwan can no longer turn back.
bolt12_573_8171.53
Taiwan will become another traitor if it goes into Japan's embrace. Only by going into mainland China's embrace will Taiwan have a bright future!
bolt12_573_8171.54
In short, James Soong is merely someone through whom mainland China's stance ranging from active cooperation to slight warning is demonstrated.
bolt12_573_8171.55
If Ma Ying-jeou does not want to oversleep after going back to bed in the morning, he must truly face what the people of both sides of the Strait have been hoping for for a century!
bolt12_573_8171.56
It is up to him whether he wants to be a sinner of the nation or a meritorious contributor to the nation!
bolt12_573_8171.57
When that time comes, the people of mainland China will respond enthusiastically to Ma Ying-jeou!

A Letter from the Victim's Family
bolt12_6325_7340.2
First of all, I would like to thank a kind-hearted person for calling the police immediately. I would also like to thank the public security authority for the prompt capture of the perpetrators.
bolt12_6325_7340.3
Early in the morning on September 1, my father, as usual, was riding his bicycle to Gucheng Park for exercise. At Jiuli Street, he saw someone lying on the side of the road, and so, out of kindness, he went up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon. Then, three people ran up to him, kicking and beaing him (according to the police, they had drunk four cases of beer at the time). As a result, my father's skull suffered serious injury. He bled profusely and lost consciousness. By the time he was taken to the hospital, his pupils were already dilated. However, with prompt rescue given by a doctor, he survived. As there was serious bleeding, the doctor performed a life-saving surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father's head to remove blood clots. Due to profuse bleeding, some of the blood had already flowed into the brainstem and bottom of the brain, putting his life in danger.
bolt12_6325_7340.4
Right now, my father is in very serious condition. On September 1, he underwent a 5-hour craniotomy. On September 2, he had a tracheotomy and a respirator was used to help him breathe. Currently, he is still unconscious. After these few days of hospital treatment, he is sometimes able to move his arms and feet, and he is showing signs of recovery.
bolt12_6325_7340.5
As his children, we feel very terrible now. It has been six days since the incident. Under the police's advice, the perpetrators finally gave 10,000 yuan. We have already delivered the money to the hospital. Now, almost 50,000 yuan has been spent on the medical bills. We don't know when we can get money to pay for future medical bills.
bolt12_6325_7340.6
We have now already received a payment reminder from the hospital. If we do not pay on time, the hospital will stop supplying medications. When that happens, I cannot bear to think of what will happen to my father.
bolt12_6325_7340.7
Our family has very poor living conditions. My mother only gets a minimum welfare pay of 380 yuan, and she has diabetes. My father is a retired coking plant worker. His pay is also just a bit over 1,000 yuan. I am doing odd jobs at a factory, and I have not even made any medical insurance or pension contributions. My elder sister is also an odd-job worker. She has also not made any pension or medical insurance contributions. Furthermore, I am going to be a father soon. I have a very heavy family burden. Our family now can only rely on my father's pay to survive. We absolutely cannot afford such high hospital costs.
bolt12_6325_7340.8
It has been six days since the incident. As victims, we have the rights of a citizen to know some things:
bolt12_6325_7340.9
1. Where are the perpetrators from? How are their family and financial conditions?
bolt12_6325_7340.10
2. When can the case be submitted to the procuratorate? When can public prosecution be initiated?
bolt12_6325_7340.11
3. We hope the perpetrators can cooperate actively and take practical actions to work together to first save my father's life.
bolt12_6325_7340.12
4. We request to meet the parents of the perpetrators.
bolt12_6325_7340.13
We hope the news media can help us to jointly save the life of my kind-hearted father.
bolt12_6325_7340.14
We also ask the government departments to coordinate with one another and be flexible to activate my father's medical insurance card and save his life.
bolt12_6325_7340.15
After the court verdict is out, all medical costs will be paid back to the medical insurance bureau.
bolt12_6325_7340.16

It is legal as long as three hours of sunshine can be achieved.
bolt12_6326_4210.2
Most high-rise buildings with a spacing of 100 meters can certainly achieve that.
bolt12_6326_4210.3
Three hours of sunshine, from morning till night, can certainly be achieved.
bolt12_6326_4210.4
Most sunlight issues raised by the elderly men and women are indeed not against the national requirements, so they're merely unreasonable complaints of the elderly as a result of their perceived discomfort.
bolt12_6326_4210.5
Even if there is a court judgment confirming that the developer is not against the law, they will still persist with their unreasonable demands.
bolt12_6326_4211.1
Reply to Light-and-shadow-hero on the 10th floor:
bolt12_6326_4211.2
Three hours of sunshine is a technical term. Sunlight analysis is needed. Setbacks of spacing are related to not only the sunshine spacing but also the floor thickness. A sunshine spacing coefficient of 1:1.4 can meet the requirement for three hours of sunshine on the day of Great Cold in Taizhou. All we want is that the developer does the job legally, and makes it clear that sunshine analysis has shown that the minimum national requirements can be met!
bolt12_6326_4211.3
But what you said is also somewhat reasonable. The minimum standards are not acceptable to most people. They have a good reason to ask for more sunlight. However, this developer is too strong. We just want to secure the minimum legitimate interests according to the national regulations, but even that is so difficult for us!

In Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, an old man doing morning exercise helped a drunk man up and was mistaken as a thief and badly beaten up
bolt12_632_5731.2
Five young men who work as chefs at Zhenjiang Hotel were strolling on the street in the early morning on the 2nd after downing several bottles of beer.
bolt12_632_5731.3
One of the men, Ji, squatted on the stone step of a bus stop.
bolt12_632_5731.4
Mr. Yang, an old man from Zhenjiang who is in his 60s, was passing by while on his morning exercise. After seeing that, he asked Ji to go home soon, and then held out his hands to help Ji up.
bolt12_632_5731.5
However, Ji mistook Mr. Yang for wanting to steal his things, so immediately together with Wu and Ma, he battered the old man violently till he was seriously injured!
bolt12_632_5731.6
Murderers all go for the head!
bolt12_632_5731.7
I think they meant to kill him!
bolt12_632_5731.8
Latest news: Victim Mr. Yang passed away around 9 a.m. on 9/13/2011. Perpetrators remain under criminal detention.
bolt12_632_5731.9
However, this incident has not yet come to a close. The victim's family may still have to wait for the police to conduct an autopsy on the victim.

A Letter from the Victim's Family
bolt12_632_5731.12
First of all, I would like to thank a kind-hearted person for calling the police immediately. I would also like to thank the public security authority for the prompt capture of the perpetrators.
bolt12_632_5731.13
Early in the morning on September 1, my father, as usual, was riding his bicycle to Gucheng Park for exercise.
bolt12_632_5731.14
At Jiuli Street, he saw someone lying on the side of the road, and so, out of kindness, he went up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon.
bolt12_632_5731.15
Then, three people ran up to him, kicking and beating him
bolt12_632_5731.16
(according to the police, they had drunk four cases of beer at the time),
bolt12_632_5731.17
as a result, my father's skull suffered serious injury. He bled profusely and lost consciousness. By the time he was taken to the hospital, his pupils were already dilated.
bolt12_632_5731.18
However, with prompt rescue given by a doctor, he survived.
bolt12_632_5731.19
As there was serious bleeding, the doctor performed a life-saving surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father's head to remove blood clots.
bolt12_632_5731.20
Due to profuse bleeding, some of the blood had already flowed into the brainstem and bottom of the brain, putting his life in danger.
bolt12_632_5731.21
Right now, my father is in very serious condition.
bolt12_632_5731.22
On September 1, he underwent a 5-hour craniotomy. On September 2, he had a tracheotomy, and a respirator was used to help him breathe.
bolt12_632_5731.23
Currently, he is still unconscious.
bolt12_632_5731.24
After these few days of hospital treatment, he is sometimes able to move his arms and feet, and he is showing signs of recovery.
bolt12_632_5731.25
As his children, we feel very terrible now.
bolt12_632_5731.26
It has been six days since the incident. Under the police's advice, the perpetrators finally gave 10,000 yuan. We have already delivered the money to the hospital.
bolt12_632_5731.27
Now, almost 50,000 yuan has been spent on the medical bills. We don't know when we can get money to pay for future medical bills.
bolt12_632_5731.28
We have now already received a payment reminder from the hospital.
bolt12_632_5731.29
If we do not pay on time, the hospital will stop supplying medications. When that happens, I cannot bear to think of what will happen to my father.
bolt12_632_5731.30
Our family has very poor living conditions. My mother only gets a minimum welfare pay of 380 yuan, and she has diabetes.
bolt12_632_5731.31
My father is a retired coking plant worker. His pay is also only a bit over 1,000 yuan.
bolt12_632_5731.32
I am doing odd jobs at a factory, and I have not even made any medical insurance or pension contributions.
bolt12_632_5731.33
My elder sister is also an odd-job worker. She has also not made any pension or medical insurance contributions.
bolt12_632_5731.34
Furthermore, I am going to be a father soon. I have a very heavy family burden.
bolt12_632_5731.35
Our family now can only rely on my father's pay to survive. We absolutely cannot afford such high hospital costs.
bolt12_632_5731.36
It has been six days since the incident. As victims, we have the rights of a citizen to know some things:
bolt12_632_5731.37
1. Where are the perpetrators from? How are their family and financial conditions?
bolt12_632_5731.38
2. When can the case be submitted to the procuratorate? When can public prosecution be initiated?
bolt12_632_5731.39
3. We hope the perpetrators can cooperate actively and take practical actions to work together to first save my father's life.
bolt12_632_5731.40
4. We request to meet the parents of the perpetrators.
bolt12_632_5731.41
We hope the news media can help us to jointly save the life of my kind-hearted father.
bolt12_632_5731.42
We also ask the government departments to coordinate with one another and be flexible to activate my father's medical insurance card and save his life.
bolt12_632_5731.43
After the court verdict is out, all medical costs will be paid back to the medical insurance bureau.
bolt12_632_5731.44
A million thanks to the city residents and media for the concern they have shown us in this incident.
bolt12_632_5731.45
May all you kind-hearted people have a life of peace!

Victim: Old Mr. Yang is currently still unconscious and in critical condition.
bolt12_632_5731.49
The family members of Old Mr. Yang said tearfully that when the old man was being sent to the hospital, his pupils were already dilated. He has been transferred to ICU (intensive care unit) after receiving emergency treatment given by the hospital.
bolt12_632_5731.50
The medical costs alone add up to as much as more than 5,000 yuan a day.
bolt12_632_5731.51
Perpetrators: Three men have been criminally detained by Zhenjiang Jingkou police.
bolt12_632_5731.52
After the three of them paid 10,000 yuan in total for the medical costs,
bolt12_632_5731.53
the family of Ma recently again raised 10,000 yuan to pay for surgery.
bolt12_632_5731.54
Hereby, we hope the perpetrators will be able to show resolution in taking on responsibilities and face seriously the mistake that has been committed.
bolt12_632_5731.55
Victim's family: As Old Mr. Yang is still in a toxic and unconscious state, he is unable to provide information about what happened at the time of the incident.
bolt12_632_5731.56
Though the three perpetrators have paid 10,000 yuan compensation in total, it is obviously not enough to pay for the current medical costs that are increasing sharply by the day.
bolt12_632_5731.57
Furthermore, in view of the criminal detention time limit, can such punishment have a deterrent effect on the perpetrators?
bolt12_632_5731.58
How about future medical costs?

The Yang family hopes to get legal and media assistance.

Would everyone agree with illegal construction of high-rise buildings?
bolt12_632_6421.2
Now, in the hometown of our beloved General Secretary Hu, such a strange thing is happening.
bolt12_632_6421.3
Here is the thing: Shenzhen Maoye Developer has come to Hailing District, Taizhou City, Jiangsu Province for urban construction, and is welcomed by our people.
bolt12_632_6421.4
We do not oppose the construction of high-rise buildings. However, the developer is going to construct a high-rise building against the law. That is what we are resolutely opposed to!
bolt12_632_6421.5
Maoye Developer has planned a high-rise building of 150 m in the Julangchao lot of the old East Station, Hailing District, Taizhou City.
bolt12_632_6421.6
Julangchao used to be the eastern suburbs park, for which many of the old Taizhou people have great affection.
bolt12_632_6421.7
Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 is just located at the back of the Julangchao lot, and now Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 is only about 100 meters from the external walls of the original buildings at the farthest end of the Julangchao lot.
bolt12_632_6421.8
How does the developer meet the national requirement for building setbacks based on a minimum sunshine spacing of 1:1.4 in Taizhou?
bolt12_632_6421.9
Aside from the other sunshine shelters, how can the developer ensure a minimum three hours of sunshine on the day of Great Cold?
bolt12_632_6421.10
It is certainly not feasible if they want to cheat about the 3 hours technically,
bolt12_632_6421.11
The plain fact is just in front of us. Moreover, are those few entities the only ones capable of doing sunshine analysis in China?
bolt12_632_6421.12
We certainly will verify it. A lie will never become the truth!
bolt12_632_6421.13
If the developer can not even give us owners a minimum of three hours on the day of Great Cold in accordance with the national requirement, which has ensured its best interests, how can it give a reasonable and fair explanation to the society, the vast community of netizens and the masses?
bolt12_632_6421.14
Where are the conscience and morals of the developer?
bolt12_632_6421.15
We understand that the developer wants to get more benefits, but those are supposed to be legitimate benefits!
bolt12_632_6421.16
On the one hand, such act, if illegally infringing upon other people's interests, will be detrimental to the reputation and long-term future development of the entire Maoye group. On the other hand, are people whose interests are infringed all fools?
bolt12_632_6421.17
Will they just let the infringement occur?
bolt12_632_6421.18
The minimum 3 hours is already difficult to accept. If it is basically an illegal act that makes the fundamental three hours even less, think about it - how will things evolve?
bolt12_632_6421.19
Finally, the contradictions are bound to intensify, making the situation out of hand.
bolt12_632_6421.20
We hope that the developer can seriously think about this issue, avoid losses and seek its own legal interests through rational development and reasonable development according to law!
bolt12_632_6421.21
If the developer are determined to infringe on our rights and interests, we will surely unite as one to defend our legitimate rights and interests!
bolt12_632_6421.22
The most strange thing is that some people of high rank even agree with the illegal construction of high-rise buildings. We hereby earnestly request the people of high rank who agree with the illegal construction of high-rise buildings to raise their hands and give us a way out!
bolt12_632_6421.23
All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter. Let's see whether it will ultimately be "power over law" or "law over power" for the officials in General Secretary Hu's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer!

All netizens are welcome to look into this matter!
bolt12_632_6423.1
Hello, everyone!
bolt12_632_6423.2
Previously, due to issues about the high-rise buildings on Maoye's pre-sale renderings and EIA by the Taizhou Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, the young and old of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 were neither sleeping nor eating well. Some were depressed, and some were irritated. In short, we felt very angry.
bolt12_632_6423.3
Now Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau has given us a clear answer that those were simply renderings. Upon verification, the Planning Bureau has requested the developer to make modification. The Bureau will definitely exercise administration according to law, and never approve anything unless it is legal, reasonable and fair! A forum and a hearing will also be held prior to approval! A large stone in our hearts has finally dropped onto the ground.
bolt12_632_6423.4
We are moved that in the face of such a huge benefit, our leaders of Taizhou Municipal Government and Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau have stood unswayed, showing a very noble sentiment and reflecting the characteristics of the Communists in serving the people, which is truly admirable!
bolt12_632_6423.5
All owners of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 hereby express deep respect and gratitude to Taizhou Municipal Government and Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau for upholding justice! People living in Taizhou are happy, thanks to the officials caring for them like their parents!
bolt12_632_6423.6
We thank the government for its concerns over people! We strongly support for the government administration according to law!

I hope that the developer does not come to compete against us for sunlight. How do we live without sunlight?
bolt12_632_6425.1
All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter. Let's see whether it will ultimately be "power over law" or "law over power" for the officials in General Secretary Hu's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer! For us ordinary people who are like dog shit in this society, it is ridiculous to discuss whether power or law is superior.
bolt12_632_6426.1
I feel really good about that oh oh
bolt12_632_6427.1
What's the point of law over power?
bolt12_632_6427.2
It is the powerful that make the final execution.
bolt12_632_6428.1
Yeah, in the real world, we vulnerable groups really feel at a loss as to what to do so often. The power of developers is too great,
bolt12_632_6428.2
Some relevant government departments just blatantly give the green light to developers against the law and help them fool people!
bolt12_632_6428.3
So we have to frequently ask ourselves: is the law enacted by this country really useful?
bolt12_632_6428.4
Is it really capable of restraining developers from grabbing through deceit or by force and illegally obtaining benefits?
bolt12_632_6429.1
But we can not just watch as the developer take away our sunlight, leaving children and the elderly shivering at home in cold winter. If so, we can't live a healthy life, nor can we enjoy the warmth of the sun!
bolt12_64533_0510.1
Japan had been thinking about invading China for a long time. Would it need the assignment from Russia to decide whether to invade China or not? Not to mention that the US only acts against the political system of China? Was it still not enough for Russia to be fooled after 1991?
bolt12_64533_0511.1
The weapons market in South Asia has been dominated by the hairy country. Though it is weakened by the US weapons market, however, the Russian weapons market still occupies the major portion.
bolt12_64533_0511.2
It is not Russia deliberately making use of countries on the South China Sea to besiege China.
bolt12_64533_0511.3
Looking at the chaos in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, even thinking with your ass, you will also know that it is the US rather than Russia trying to cause trouble.
bolt12_64533_0511.4
Firstly, Russia is not a country with sea power. It has no interest in intervening and meddling in the issues of the East and South China Seas.
bolt12_64533_0511.5
Secondly, at present, with the expansion and extrusion of NATO, Russia can hardly protect its own traditional zone of influence. We can say it is busy enough with its own affairs.
bolt12_64533_0511.6
And presently, the Asia-Pacific Military Cooperation and NATO are all products of the US's two-ocean strategy.
bolt12_64533_0511.7
After World War I, two systems had taken place. One is the Versailles System in Europe and the Atlantic, and the other was the US-Japanese Washington System in the Far East and the Pacific.
bolt12_64533_0511.8
The US stretches over the two oceans, and controls the two systems at the same time.
bolt12_64533_0511.9
After World War II, it took control of the two systems respectively, castrating Germany in Europe, and Japan staying alone in Asia to be hermaphrodites, living on by helping the US manufacture electronics and automobile products.
bolt12_64533_0511.10
And now, the biggest enemies for the US are such large geopolitical powers in the Old World as Russia and China.
bolt12_64533_0511.11
While Russia and the West have no so-called estrangement in ideology and political system, NATO still continues to expand to the east.
bolt12_64533_0511.12
And now the Asia-Pacific Military Cooperation is setting up a blockage line and a ring of encirclement around the coastal regions in East and South China.
bolt12_64533_0511.13
The coup in Central Asia has not succeeded. Otherwise, once the ring of encirclement is completed, the northern land will cause a headache to you just as the East China Sea and the South China Sea.
bolt12_64533_0511.14
Do you still believe that China can become a friend of the US as long as it changes its ideology and system?
bolt12_64533_0511.15
The reasons for China to ally with Russia are that both Russia and China need to heal their wounds from after the disintegration of the Soviet Union and with the savage hegemony of the US.
bolt12_64533_0511.16
Solving the existing territorial disputes is an important means of realizing mutual trust. Of course China has made great concessions. There is no other choice.
bolt12_64533_0511.17
In fact, unlike China, Russia has neither the policy of reform of opening up nor a good future (this precious opportunity was seized by China at the historical turning point then, while in Russia, it was ruined by the two idiots at the critical moment. It also shows that the Russians are relatively inferior to the Chinese people in terms of both IQ and EQ).
bolt12_64533_0511.18
The Russians are bare-footed, so they are not afraid of a China with shoes.
bolt12_64533_0511.19
China has enough reasons to make concessions to Russia. China has no fear. China has many opportunities and China has other approaches.
bolt12_64533_0511.20
Although Russia is not our friend, we should not turn it into an enemy.
bolt12_64533_0511.21
Russia and Japan should not be equated with each other.
bolt12_64533_0511.22
To the Chinese people, if Russia wantonly killed Chinese people in China's traditional area of activities like Japan did, then in the sentiments of ordinary Chinese people, they would hate Russia as much as they hate Japan. However, they did not.
bolt12_64533_0511.23
The only case where they wantonly killed Chinese people happened at the end of the Tsing Dynasty. It was the disputable Hailanpao Slaughter.
bolt12_64533_0511.24
Thousands or tens of thousands, the number is just a small proportion even compared with the population of the Manchu.
bolt12_64533_0511.25
It can even be ignored if compared with the Chinese population of nearly 400 million. Can it be equated with Japan's massacre of Chinese people in the populated North and Southeast of China?
bolt12_64533_0511.26
Besides, Russia is a European country with its strategic focus in the west. The Far East is never its focus.
bolt12_64533_0511.27
If the Russians really want to seriously take China as their arch enemy, they should strive to construct the Far East.
bolt12_64533_0511.28
However, nowadays, with its own serious problems, it continues to abandon the Far East and many cities have become heaps of ruins.
bolt12_64533_0511.29
It shows that Russia's strategic focus has been in the west, addressing the expansion of NATO. Only traitors will be advocating hostile relations between China and Russia here.
bolt12_64533_0511.30
The US can pose a greater threat and impact upon China than Russia, especially in the core area of China.
bolt12_64533_0511.31
The reasons are simple. Russia is a European country. The Far East is not its focus, while the US is a country in the Asia-Pacific region.
bolt12_64533_0511.32
Do you know the theory of sea control? Nowadays, is there more influence from the US or Russia in the issues of the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea and the Far East? It is the US! This is clear proof!
bolt12_64533_0511.33
Do you think that territorial waters aren't territory? In modern times, the strategic and economic values of territorial waters are much more than those of land territories. One can only become a strong power and have a say in the international community by controlling the sea.
bolt12_64533_0511.34
Why was it not China, its neighbor, but instead Great Britain, separated by vast oceans, that made India into a colony?
bolt12_64533_0511.35
Nowadays, Russia has serious problems itself. Its armaments are quite obsolete, and the living conditions for its people are extremely adverse. The population has faced a sharp reduction.
bolt12_64533_0511.36
The national elites all know the home country is hopeless, so they all run abroad.
bolt12_64533_0511.37
It has become common practice for women to marry foreigners, and many of them come to China and become prostitutes.
bolt12_64533_0511.38
Even the productivity of the population is seriously lacking. It is impossible for it to constitute a threat to China.
bolt12_64533_0511.39
And nowadays the US is besieging and containing China openly with a view of disrupting China.
bolt12_64533_0511.40
Why leave the current problems unsolved, but seize on Russia, which has no ability to pose a threat to China at present?
bolt12_64533_0511.41
When it comes to that Russia occupied China's territory, that is another story like the Japanese did. Japan wanted to invade the whole country of China, but can Russia do that?
bolt12_64533_0511.42
Russia is a European country with its strategic focus on the west, rather than the Far East. Its expansion to the Far East in history was also partly non-governmental and partly governmental.
bolt12_64533_0511.43
Japan is separated from China only by a strait, with the spacious Pacific behind it. There is no menace from the rear if it invades China with all its strength. Can Russia do that?
bolt12_64533_0511.44
Even if Russia puts a little bit more energy into the issues of China and the Far East, can it ignore the affairs in Europe?
bolt12_64533_0511.45
Moreover, we would rather say that Russia has availed itself of opportunities, than to say that it had invaded and occupied China's territories.
bolt12_64533_0511.46
At that time, those places were far away from China's traditional living area. China's exploration was a little bit later at that time. There have been few inhabitants around those places in history.
bolt12_64533_0511.47
At that time, those places were bitterly cold places covered with waist-deep snows. So we pay no heed to them.
bolt12_64533_0511.48
Although when it comes to now, these places are of great economic and strategic importance. However, at that time we didn't discover that; therefore, at that time even the ruler of China paid no heed to the places, and sent no immigrants there for quite a long time.
bolt12_64533_0511.49
Just like today's oceans. From the perspective of today, they have huge economic values, so territorial waters are also important territories.
bolt12_64533_0511.50
However, in the past, they were not discovered. And territorial waters were not regarded as territories. They even exercised trade prohibition on the sea area and closed the coastlines.
bolt12_64533_0511.51
Yet the Russians availed themselves of a favorable geological location to occupy those places ahead of us. The Russians were just availing themselves of opportunities.
bolt12_64533_0511.52
At that time, it was a time when big powers established colonies everywhere. Unlike today, when the behavior of all countries are bound by international laws.
bolt12_64533_0511.53
Other big powers had to capture colonies by war. For example, it was through war that Britain and Japan occupied Hong Kong and Taiwan respectively.
bolt12_64533_0511.54
However, the Russians got such a big place without much effort. That was because the ruler of China didn't care for the unexplored places.
bolt12_64533_0511.55
They just availed themselves of opportunities. Things such as territory are hard to talk about.
bolt12_64533_0511.56
If it was your imminent area of activity, it might be justifiable.
bolt12_64533_0511.57
However, if it was a place that you didn't send immigrants to explore for a long period throughout history, and was taken by others because of a favorable geographical location and convenient access, then as time goes by it would be hard to say, after a certain length of time.
bolt12_64533_0511.58
It would be barely passable for you to claim it to be yours. This is totally different from Japan. Can Russia launch a barbaric war of aggression to occupy China's imminent territories like Japan did?
bolt12_64533_0511.59
Can it provoke * to invade northeast China and launch an all-out war of aggression against China because northeast China had become an imminent territory of China like northern China with the arrival and exploration of large number of immigrants from inside Shanhaiguan Pass? It is impossible.

The opinions of the writer Wuhan Tuo La Ji Shou on the upper floor are brilliant! However, by reversing the order of "subjugation of the nation" and "elimination of the entire race," would it be in line with the historical facts?

Right now Russia is clamoring "to build India into the top military power in Asia." Putin personally sealed the arms sale deal to sell India advanced weapons such as aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered submarines, T50 fighters and BrahMos missiles ... Even the weapons it sells to Vietnam are more advanced than those it sells to China. And it only sells China big airplanes and carrier aircraft. Its wild ambitions are thoroughly exposed!

bolt12_6453_3051.4
It seems that all Chinese hate Japanese, and I am not an exception. However, has everybody thought it over that it was Russia who stirred up the war between China and Japan for fear that China would reclaim territories from it? It was also Russia that went between the Communist Party and the KMT and was able to achieve success one way or the other. And at the end of the war of resistance, it then stirred up the civil war, and lured China to get involved in the Korean War. If Stalin was still alive, China would have more trouble!
bolt12_6453_3051.5
Even if it has propped up an agent in China, it is still concerned about China. And in the 21st century, it continues to play little tricks of provoking anti-Chinese sentiments. It sold weapons to Vietnam and checked and seized the cargos of Chinese merchants. Its crimes are so numerous that bamboo strips would be exhausted before they could all be recorded.
bolt12_6453_3051.6
What is regretful is that our government deals with such kind of things in different ways. If the US or Japan does so, Mr. Qin Gang and Ms. Jiangyu would absolutely deliver a so-called just and severe statement of condemnation. Yet with regard to the incident of the Chinese boatmen who were shot by Russia, there was not even a protest presented. And it became an incident with no definite results in the year 2009.

The greatest threat of subjugation of the nation comes from Russia. In history, countries being eliminated by this nation were as many as the stars in the sky. Moreover, in the history of China, almost all geographical threats came from the north.

The Sino-Japanese war and the civil war of China were stirred up by Russia, and Russia has the ability to force China to send troops to North Korea? Nonsense!
bolt12_6453_3271.1
For China, China and United States have the biggest relationship in the world, and the Sino-US relationship is a trade-off relationship.
bolt12_6453_3271.2
In the most recent visit to the US by Xi Jinping, which is an exercise before he becomes the top official in China, the primary topic discussed was mutually beneficial economic cooperation of the two sides.
bolt12_6453_3271.3
The Sino-US relationship is very complicated. Economically, the two sides are partners on unequal footings,
bolt12_6453_3271.4
politically, it is a relationship between socialism and capitalism; militarily, Chinese and US militaries are in an isolated state.
bolt12_6453_3271.5
Therefore, currently China is playing games with the United States, i.e. how to offset the latter two relationships with economic cooperation.
bolt12_6453_3271.6
Next is a brief analysis of the main strategy of Xi Jinping's visit to the US:
bolt12_6453_3271.7
First, what is the biggest puzzle between China and the US?
bolt12_6453_3271.8
The biggest puzzle in front of China is how to maintain its relationship with the US as it becomes increasingly powerful.
bolt12_6453_3271.9
To China, it cannot fall out with the US.
bolt12_6453_3271.10
If China falls out with the US, then it will seriously consumes China's strengths and will be very unfavorable for future development of China,
bolt12_6453_3271.11
because China will lose the situation of peaceful development internationally, such that China has to cope with not only the powerful military threat posed by the US, but also complicated relations in the neighboring areas. This will seriously consume China energy for development.
bolt12_6453_3271.12
Therefore, on the premise of not falling out with the US, China, on the one hand, still has to maintain relationship with the US, while on the other hand, it has to precaution against the dirty tricks that the US plays on China.
bolt12_6453_3271.13
Second, it is not time yet to be tough to the US.
bolt12_6453_3271.14
Some believe that China should be tough to the US. Is the US someone that yields to hawkishness?
bolt12_6453_3271.15
In the Soviet Union era, it got in a race for hegemony against the US, where both sides were so tough that they became enemies, which provided the US the opportunity to break up thoroughly with the Soviet Union.
bolt12_6453_3271.16
As the US does not need the USSR to exist as a great power, the US could attack the USSR and tackle the USSR without any hesitation.
bolt12_6453_3271.17
The road China is going along at present is one where the two sides are intertwined with each other, such that the US also suffers great loss when attacking and imposing sanctions on China.
bolt12_6453_3271.18
What's more, many businesspeople in the US also come out to oppose the government's behaviors. China will be able to truly rise as long as it can keep on for ten years.
bolt12_6453_3271.19
As the ancient saying goes, a gentleman can afford to wait for as long as ten years to avenge. If China falls out with the US too early, it will put itself in a very disadvantaged position.
bolt12_6453_3271.20
Although we are strong today, it's not time yet to fight the final battle with the US.
bolt12_6453_3271.21
Third, the two phases that the Sino-US relationship will go through.
bolt12_6453_3271.22
It is not advisable to fight a major war in the China's dealings with the US.
bolt12_6453_3271.23
The author believes the two sides could only undergo two phases. The first one is a period which sees China grow in strength and the US feel seriously threatened.
bolt12_6453_3271.24
The second stage is when China has become strong, the US is no longer certain about winning a war with China, such that it has no choice than to cooperate in order to obtain more benefits.
bolt12_6453_3271.25
To avoid war between China and the US, it appears extremely important to carry out exchanges between the two peoples.
bolt12_6453_3271.26
Next let's have a look at survey results of Americans view towards China:
bolt12_6453_3271.27
An opinion poll of a US website shows that 6% of the people believe China and the US are "allies," 69% think they are "friendly but not allies," and 4% believe they are "enemies."
bolt12_6453_3271.28
Survey results also show that 71% of the Americans believe Sino-US relations are "very important or somewhat important," while the proportion is 85% in opinion leaders.
bolt12_6453_3271.29
On the 14th, the Washington Post said that in an opinion poll it conducted jointly with the American Broadcasting Company, 52% of the respondents saw China in a negative way.
bolt12_6453_3271.30
This result reflects two urgent issues. First, China is not that bad in the mind of American people, and there is still environment and scope to continue expanding exchanges.
bolt12_6453_3271.31
Second, if China and the US do not handle their relations properly, lacking in communications between its peoples and the foundation or friendship, then the Chinese and American peoples may turn hostile.
bolt12_6453_3271.32
Therefore, the Chinese and American peoples must enhance cooperation and bring the two sides closer through economic cooperation, so as to offset the discrepancies brought by military and politics.
bolt12_6453_3271.33
However, it is undeniable that serious conflicts remain between China and the US in some important areas.
bolt12_6453_3271.34
For instance: the Taiwan issue; human rights and democracy; North Korea; Iran; proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; Pakistan; geopolitics and military strategy; trade and currency; intellectual property rights and internet spies.
bolt12_6453_3271.35
These puzzles cannot be overcome with the two characters of friendship alone. After all it involves major interests.
bolt12_6453_3271.36
So it is no secret to the two sides. Just like Vice President Xi Jinping counts on the US to oppose Taiwan independence and Tibetan, how could China count on a geopolitical enemy?
bolt12_6453_3271.37
National presidents are all masters in politics, who know what's at stake. However, what should be said should be said. The thing is if the US has said something, it will break its words if it doesn't do what it said, which will show to people in the world that the US is immoral and its words don't count.
bolt12_6453_3271.38
Anyway, between China and the US in the future, whoever is a better strategist and whoever comes up with more sophisticated strategy wins.
bolt12_6453_3271.39
It requires wisdom to be friends with an enemy. You can only fight a hundred wars without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well.
bolt12_6453_3272.1

bolt12_6453_3273.1
The cannons are thicker

bolt12_64545_0564.8
Take a look at North Korea, that's our country many years ago. Take a look at their ridiculous propaganda.
bolt12_64545_0565.1
The United States' dream of occupying the whole world has never stopped, it is constantly being planned.
bolt12_6454_5051.1
These days, there's a kind of feeling that's more and more intense: It's that America, through long-term bribing of the Chinese intellectual elite has already succeeded in setting up a "fifth column".
bolt12_6454_5051.2
These people may consider themselves to be culture celebrities or may be of high authority and important position, and are distributed in various circles in society, taking great pains to promote American values* and brainwash the Chinese people on behalf of the Americans.
bolt12_6454_5051.3
Why is this kind of feeling getting more and more intense?
bolt12_6454_5051.4
Because these days, I've been reading part of the "Specialist Professor" blog, it would have been okay if I didn't read it, but after I read it, it made me really surprised.
bolt12_6454_5051.5
For example, Assistant Professor Zhang Ming of Renmin University, the political intentions of many of his blogs are extremely obvious.
bolt12_6454_5051.6
Such as, in one blog he attributed the reason for the prevalence of hostility in China to elementary school textbooks having "Wang Erxiao", and he disparaged good articles that promote patriotism as not even worth a penny.
bolt12_6454_5051.7
Another example is so-called "sexologist" and "social activist" Li Yinhe - one, her stuff is not similar to things like the treatise "Haite Sexology Report"; two, she has no deep thought; and three, she has no significant contributions.
bolt12_6454_5051.8
She main relies on doing something novel and different and on shocking viewpoints to attract people's eyes, but without real ability or learning, she's purely a jumping clown,
bolt12_6454_5051.9
This kind of person puts on the big "specialist" hat just to intimidate people; the key is that she is concerned about politics yet doesn't understand politics, is willing to be a slave of foreigners yet is arrogant and overbearing, is ignorant yet feels fine.
bolt12_6454_5051.10
Like in the essay "A bit less hostility, a bit more harmony", she completely denigrates class struggle and the anti-pornography-and-illegal-publications drive as social hostility;
bolt12_6454_5051.11
in the essay "China has already become the country which worships money most on the earth", she attributes Chinese society's worship of money to atheism;
bolt12_6454_5051.12
the essay "Are you studying Paul or studying Bill?", she blathers that "people who study Paul will become terrorists";
bolt12_6454_5051.13
in the essay "Recommendation for establishment of a constitutional court to solve the problem of pornographic products", she takes citizens publishing pornographic novels to be freedom of speech, and says the Beijing anti-pornography drive is unconstitutional behavior, etc.
bolt12_6454_5051.14
Especially today's masterpiece, "Why is it worth paying such close attention to the Jianghe obscene goods case?", where she is once again crying foul over several people suspected of involvement in erotic business activities who are being dealt with by Beijing City, as well as detailing a list of erotic products, with a deeper intent of doing publicity for other people."
bolt12_6454_5051.15
But these kind of jerky articles actually being put on top by Sina blog is really preposterous!
bolt12_6454_5051.16
And there is also Sichuanese poet Liu Shahe, who, while America clear to the eye and with swelling gall engages in containment of China and the people of the whole nation are feeling indignant, actually comes out with the fallacy "China and America are friendly", and tries to pour spirit-confusing soup on the Chinese people willfully and without fear;
bolt12_6454_5051.17
Yi Zhongtian,who got famous by remarking upon the "three countries", whose talent and learning I have always respected, but I didn't expect that he was actually supporting the big traitor of China, Mao Yushi, saying some things like "I believe whoever disrespects Mao Yushi is not human", once again making me very much drop my glasses!
bolt12_6454_5051.18
Also, as for the rumor on the internet a short time ago "Complete notes on 100 Chinese celebrities who accepted political contributions from the Ford Foundation", I feel that the segment of the intellectual elite in China who are "becoming treasonous" are increasingly ardent and have already become willful and without fear, to a level of publicly harming the country.
bolt12_6454_5051.19
But I do not understand, when these people frequently make treasonous remarks, why no one curbs them and they, moreover, can continue to occupy high positions, calling the wind and rousing the rain among the intelligentsia and in public opinion?
bolt12_6454_5051.20
Contacting "Southern newspapers", which were temporarily fierce a short while ago, I feel that part of the intellectual elite have possibly sunk together with media personalities!
bolt12_6454_5051.21
I remember, 60-some years ago the US had just fought a war with China, and still threatened China with the use of nuclear weapons;
bolt12_6454_5051.22
40-some years ago, the US entered Vietnam with the intention of containing China;
bolt12_6454_5051.23
although 32 years ago it had established relations with China, 22 years ago it again started imposing sanctions on China, 12 years ago it bombed a Chinese embassy, 10 years ago the South China Sea collision incident occurred, and two years ago it restarted its containment of China with great fanfare.
bolt12_6454_5051.24
I don't understand, why are we Chinese so forgetful?
bolt12_6454_5051.25
Why are there still so many people ignoring their conscience and speaking on the behalf of the US?
bolt12_6454_5051.26
Without taking a big loss, people don't improve their abilities to remember - this is possibly the greatest weakness of us Chinese.
bolt12_6454_5051.27
Therefore, it also stands to reason that the forces of the traitors of China are rampaging and the fifth column is running rampant
bolt12_6454_5052.1
It's entirely possible - don't we ourselves raise "traitors to China" among primary school students?

Hello, everyone! We all know the "September 18th" Incident, but now Japan again has a premeditated plan for another "September 18th" on the sea, another "Lugou Bridge on the sea".
bolt12_6455_6561.4
Japan surprisingly defied the strong condemnation of the whole world, openly invaded our country's sacred territory, "the Diaoyu Islands".
bolt12_6455_6561.5
As we all know, the "Diaoyu Islands" have always belonged to China; due to historical reasons, what originally belongs us has become controversial.
bolt12_6455_6561.6
My fellow citizens, ours is ours, what need is there to negotiate! Japan thus goes even further - wants to create a fact of occupation. Can we allow this? No - absolutely not!
bolt12_6455_6561.7
My fellow citizens, Japan's militarism has brought the people of Asia grave disasters.
bolt12_6455_6561.8
Especially China suffered the ravages of Japan for as long as several decades.
bolt12_6455_6561.9
In the Northeast, Japanese Unit 731 cruelly conducted human body experiments on living people of China, Korea and other countries, the method of which were extremely brutal; the Nanjing Massacre added a layer of blood to the ancient capital which will never fade away; the big bloody battles at Hengyang and Changsha laid bare the bones of the dead over a thousand kilometers and killed off everything ...
bolt12_6455_6561.10
My fellow citizens, of the heinous crimes committed by Japan in China, there are too many instances to cite, difficult to record without exhausting all bamboo strips.
bolt12_6455_6561.11
It's just as if those ten million deceased souls who lost their lives are wandering over the Pacific Ocean, finding it difficult to rest in peace.

All the people who experienced that era must still remember it vividly; even our younger generations also will cry with tears streaming down our cheeks, and our blood boils with indignation, whenever we turn to this page of history and read!
bolt12_6455_6561.13
Now Japan actually wants to reverse the verdict on the history of its aggression - fellow citizens, fellow Chinese in Asia, wake up!
bolt12_6455_6561.14
Although it is painful to look back at these hundred years of shame, we must go face it; although historical issues have not been resolved, let us create and choose history!
bolt12_6455_6561.15
Since there is responsibility, we are not afraid. The territory is small, but it is related to the matter of dignity; no matter how the winds and clouds changes, the interests of the country and national unity are the guarantee of honor; even though scarred with wounds, we can not let our native lands be separated!
bolt12_6455_6561.16
My fellow citizens, for the Chinese nation, the advent of the twenty-first century means a time when we are beset with difficulties inside while being pressed from outside, and we will face many challenges.
bolt12_6455_6561.17
The Taiwan issue, the Tibet issue, the South China Sea issue, the surrounding environment, as well as the foreign forces which are aggressive to China - which way should we go?
bolt12_6455_6561.18
What to do, fellow citizens? Please take a look at the map of the world, that crescent-shaped encirclement is suppressing our breathing, strangling our development, and coveting our national territory.
bolt12_6455_6561.19
We do not want to make enemies, but are never afraid of enemies; we do not want war, but are never afraid of war.
bolt12_6455_6561.20
We must urgently arrange arms, strengthen all military forces on land, on sea, and in the air.
bolt12_6455_6561.21
Over thousands of years, the Chinese nation has flourished several times, but before it has never had ambition to expand its territory outward.

Not imposing on others what we don't want ourselves, what we follow is a foreign security strategic philosophy which applies benevolence and virtue.
bolt12_6455_6561.23
The tolerance and liberalness of a country are like those of an individual - we avoid hurting others, but must insist on not being hurt ourselves.
bolt12_6455_6561.24
Tolerance is certainly not fear, and sincerity does not have to be cowardice.
bolt12_6455_6561.25
China exempting Japan from war reparations for World War II was in service of peace, benevolent peace.

bolt12_6455_6561.29
My thoughts go through those yellowing pages of history, as if I saw Emperor Kangxi, the famous ruler of a generation, contemplating alone about how to achieve unification of the territory in his audience hall, hundreds of years ago; also as if I saw Abraham Lincoln, former U.S. President, wandering alone in the dark of a great hall, thinking about the integrity of the Union.
bolt12_6455_6561.30
"Although it is peaceful throughout the world, it is certainly dangerous to forget war!" My fellow citizens, we want development and peace, but we must never exercise forbearance blindly. The "Boxer Protocol " of national betrayal and humiliation has aggravated China's poverty and backwardness in modern time - falling behind will lead to being bullied.
bolt12_6455_6561.31
Without strength, where does peace come from!
bolt12_6455_6561.32
We must focus on national defense education, build up a Great Wall in the hearts of 1.3 billion people, and must establish the full range of a national defense system having the ability to both attack and defend;
bolt12_6455_6561.33
The best defense is to attack - we should strengthen forces which can engage in ultra-long-range attack, improve combat capability throughout all of aerospace, of great depth, and over great distances. On the premise of avoiding influence on national economic development, increase investment and construction of the defense industry, accelerate modernization and internationalization of military equipment, and establish a high-quality, high-tech elite division.

When reading over history, the heaviness and anger in my heart simmer into concern for the nation. Although I was born to cloth gown and am one of the common people, for the prosperity of the motherland, for the motherland being splendid once again, I am willing to voluntarily serve our country, and I will have no regrets even if I die!

Much envied super stars often encounter social engagements or circumstances which they don't welcome but have to join in,

bolt12_9145_5531.8
It's rumored that even some super female stars won their first roles in this way.

Gafur Rakhimov is an Uzbekistan Olympic boxing official and was depicted in the book as a major international heroin dealer and racketeer.

The 3.2 billion U.S. dollar project to buy 40 fighters will be one of the most important international military contracts awarded this year but it has encountered multiple obstacles.

South Korea's defense ministry promised to conclude its first-stage appraisal by the end of March 2002.

There has also been much newspaper speculation that the South Korean government might yield to U.S. pressure to buy Boeing's aged F-15 k.

Speculation grew in February 2002 when Defense Minister Kim Dong-Shin stressed that South Korea should consider security ties with the United States in the project.

The Defense Ministry was further pressured by numerous newspaper reports of the Air Force's evaluation of the Rafale as excellent in all categories.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020304_0028.21
Newspapers stated that the F-15 k was rated excellent in reliability and support combat capability but met only 30 percent of core technology requirements.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020304_0028.22
Newspapers stated that the Eurofighter was rated excellent in general function and reliability categories but the Rafale also earned the excellent rating for its weapons and electronic warfare capability.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020304_0028.23
The Su-35 placed fourth with ratings of ordinary in all five categories.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020304_0028.24
Rafale reportedly offered more generous terms for technology transfer and subcontracts for South Korea's aerospace industry.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020304_0028.25
The Ministry stated that the air force was just 1 of 4 evaluations.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020304_0028.26
Some analysts have stated that the study method is biased toward Boeing noting that the evaluation was revised in February 2002 to ensure that all 4 bidders would receive an automatic 60 points for technology transfer.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020304_0028.27
The English-language Korea Herald newspaper stated that this revision gives an advantage to Boeing which has been reluctant to transfer core technology.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020304_0028.28
The Korea Herald stated that when evaluators were conducting their first-stage reports the ministry ordered them to give each bidder grades within a range of 60 to 100 points instead of 0 to 100 points.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020304_0028.29

Ecological organization Greenpeace stated on June 21, 2002 that Russia helped Iran to develop nuclear weapons by building Iran's Bushehr atomic power station.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020621_0524.6
The Russian branch of Greenpeace distributed a report at a press conference of Russia's atomic energy ministry.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020621_0524.7
The ministry conceded that the Russo-Iranian accord on the plant's construction does not require the repatriation of the nuclear fuel.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020621_0524.8
The report stated that the recycling of nuclear fuel from Bushehr is not mentioned in the accord between the Russian and Iranian governments on the construction of the plant.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020621_0524.9
Greenpeace member Vladimir Chuprov said the ministry had practically admitted that Iran will not return to Russia the spent nuclear fuel from the power station and Russia's only use for Iran is to equip itself with nuclear weapons.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020621_0524.10
The atomic energy ministry confirmed the report's existence and strongly denied Greenpeace's accusations.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020621_0524.11
Ministry spokesman Nikolai Shingarev told AFP that Russia would only supply nuclear fuel to Iran on condition that it be returned to Russia after its use.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020621_0524.12
Shingarev said Russia is currently in negotiations with Iran.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020621_0524.13
This issue will be settled before the power station comes into operation.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020621_0524.14
Shingarev said the accord on Bushehr was signed before Russia passed a law permitting the import of nuclear waste last year.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020621_0524.15
This explains why the accord makes no mention of the return of the fuel.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020621_0524.16
Shingarev said it is very difficult to make a nuclear weapon from the plutonium in this fuel.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20020621_0524.17
The United States and Israel fear that the Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation could enable Tehran to acquire the technology needed to build nuclear weapons.

A wide range of sites including a very high percentage of news sites and keywords were found to be blocked.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20021203_0751.6
A U.S. study released on 03 December 2002 states that one-tenth of the Internet's sites may be blocked by Chinese authorities as part of efforts to prevent access to information on dissidents, Taiwan, Tibet and other subjects.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20021203_0751.7
The study was conducted by Harvard University's berkman Center for Internet and society.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20021203_0751.8
The study found that more than 50000 of the approximately 200000 websites tested were inaccessible from at least 1 point in China on at least 1 occasion.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20021203_0751.9
Using a more narrow definition of blocked site the study concluded that 18931 websites were being blocked to Chinese web users.

Harvard researcher and co-author of the report Ben Edelman stated that it is likely that similar percentages apply to the Internet as a whole.

Existing rods could produce 3-6 atomic bombs in 6-8 months.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20021226_0152.6
Experts stated that 8000 spent fuel rods reportedly stockpiled by North Korea at a nuclear reactor the country is threatening to re-start could be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons.

Nuclear reactor process --
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20021226_0152.15
4 meter fuel rods containing uranium oxide are burned to initiate fission -- the nucleus of the uranium atom is split, releasing neutrons that collide with other atoms, creating more neutrons in a chain reaction.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20021226_0152.16
Fission produces immense heat which is applied to water to create steam which drives turbines to generate electricity.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20021226_0152.17
Plutonium and other radioactive byproducts of the process accumulate and decrease the effectiveness of the rods until they are spent after 3-4 years.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20021226_0152.18
Spent rods consisting of highly radioactive plutonium and residual uranium are cooled in pools of water for several years to diminish radioactivity and then the plutonium is then recovered in nitrate form and converted into oxide.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20021226_0152.19
The recovered plutonium can be mixed with uranium for reuse in the reactor or used in making nuclear weapons.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20021226_0152.20
Nuclear experts stated that to make weapons, a high proportion of plutonium 239 (military grade plutonium, as opposed to the commercial plutonium used in power plants) must be extracted.

Sadagopan said most people have an alarmist view of such attacks.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030120_0196.13
The attacks range from viruses, flame-mail (abusive e-mail), stone throwing (disfiguring a home page) to cyber squatters and scripts for breaking into Internet sites.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030120_0196.14
Sadagopan stated that many sensitive installations such as nuclear and power plants, and missiles have an Internet protocol address and that once someone hacks into the sites one can trip the power lines or lead planes and missiles to their choice destinations.

Plutonium enough to produce 25 nuclear bombs which has gone unaccounted for at a Japanese nuclear facility is mostly due to measuring shortcomings and miscalculations.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030128_0155.5
A nuclear fuel reprocessing plant about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Tokyo in Tokaimura has extracted 6890 kilograms (15158 pounds or 7.6 short tons) of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel since it began operating in 770000.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030128_0155.6
A Japanese education and science ministry official said on 030128 that the total currently accounted for at the facility was 206 kg short of the plutonium initially estimated to have been produced by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from power plants.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030128_0155.7
It is known to take 5-8 kg of plutonium to produce a nuclear bomb.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030128_0155.8
The official at the ministry's nuclear safeguard office said that the case had been reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the United Nations.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030128_0155.9
The finding was also reported to the Japanese government's Atomic Energy Commission on 030128.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030128_0155.10
The education and scienc Ministry denied the possibility that any plutonium had been illegally removed from the facility.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030128_0155.11
The official said 94 kg of the missing plutonium is presumed to have dissolved into waste water without being measured.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030128_0155.12
The official added that another 29 kg disintegrated into another type of element.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030128_0155.13
The official said that plutonium may have been stuck to fuel tubes or mixed with waste water being processed to be solidified in glass and disposed of.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030128_0155.14
The official also pointed to possible errors in the estimate of plutonium extracted in the process.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030128_0155.15
The official said that there was a need for improvements in measuring and evaluating methods of plutonium.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030128_0155.16
The report was based on inspections at the Tokaimura facility done under IAEA safeguard rules designed to prevent the transfer of nuclear materials for production of nuclear weapons.

Tokaimura is a Pacific Coast complex of nuclear-related facilities and made headlines in 990000 when the world's worst nuclear plant accident since Chernobyl in 860000 occurred at a uranium reprocessing plant there.

Indian officials claim that foreign infiltrators from Pakistan executed the attack but local Kashmiri groups call this baseless propaganda.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030316_0321.6
On 16 March 2003 Kashmiri militants claimed responsibility for an attack on a police post in the disputed state of Kashmir in India stating that they attacked to avenge the killing of their commanders by Indian troops.

The Hizbul Mujahideen is the largest group fighting Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan region.

A spokesman for Hizbul Mujahideen who declined to be identified stated to AFP --
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030316_0321.9
The attack was in retaliation to the recent killing of district commander Amanullah and 3 other fighters of Hizbul Mujahideen by the Indian army in Kashmir.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030316_0321.10
Approximately 10 to 15 fighters from Hizbul Mujahideen, Harkatul Mujahideen, Harkatul Jihad-e-Islami and Al Badar attacked the camp before midnight on 15 March 2003 and into 16 March 2003 and killed at least 12 soldiers.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030316_0321.11
All the fighters who participated in the operation were local Kashmiris not infiltrators from Pakistan as claimed by Indian officials.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030316_0321.12
The Indian claim that cross-border incursions have increased is baseless and aimed at covering up its failures in occupied Kashmir.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030316_0321.13
The militants attacked the post in Gool in the Udhampur district approximately 95 miles north of Indian Kashmir's winter capital Jammu.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030316_0321.14
At least 11 people were killed in the attack.

A spokesman for another Kashmiri separatist group called Harkatul Mujahideen agreed with the Hizbul official stating --
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030316_0321.16
The attack was executed by local Kashmiri fighters affiliated with 4 groups.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030316_0321.17
If India blames foreign militants it is part of its propaganda to mislead the international community.

The book states that the drug conveys a completely positive image.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030330_0257.22
It appears modern and inoffensive because it is synthetic.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030330_0257.23

The book is referring to the pro-Yangon ethnic group said to operate around 50 laboratories close to the border and the mobile production units.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030330_0257.36
Myanmar could become an unrivaled regional producer because of the links between the military rulers and the UWSA, and the jungle canopy where UWSA operate.

In a message aired 030521 by Arabic Qatar's Al-Jazeera satellite channel, the purported voice of Ayman al-Zawahiri urged Muslims to force Westerners out of Muslim lands by attacking westerners and emulating the 010911 suicide attacks in the United States.

The speaker told Muslims not to allow Americans, British, Australians, Norwegians or other Western Christians to live in and benefit from the resources of Muslim countries.

Egyptian experts said this audiotape was a genuine recording of Zawahiri's voice and proved Zawahiri was alive and still as influential as before in al-Qaeda.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.10
Montasser al-Zayat, a lawyer who has represented Islamic militant suspects in Egypt, stated he was certain that the voice on the tape was that of Zawahiri, Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's top lieutenant.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.11
Al-Zayat stated that the recording was Zawahiri's voice, style and manner.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.12
Dia al-Rashwan stated that he believed that the voice was Zawahiri's and that the message bore Zawahiri's characteristic emphasis on Islamic militant attacks against Arab governments which are allied to the United States.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.13
Al-Rashwan is a journalist with Egypt's government daily Al-Ahram and an expert on Islamic militants.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.14
According to Rashwan, while bin Laden has always stressed international targets, Zawahiri has gradually shown increasing support for Arab targets as well.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.15
Rashwan thought it was clear that Zawahiri is still second in command of al-Qaeda and that his stress on local (Arab) targets was influencing not only statements and actions by Al-Qaeda itself but also groups inspired by them.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.16
Montasser al-Zayat said that he believed bin Laden was under secure protection with Zawahiri.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.17
Zayat thought that security conditions sometimes dictate which one speaks out.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.18
The situations and locations of Zawahiri, bin Laden and other top al-Qaeda members have been unknown since the United States struck the bases of al-Qaeda and its Taliban supporters in Afghanistan in 011000.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.19
Rashwan was unable to illuminate suspicions that Seif al-Adel, another Egyptian, might have masterminded the triple suicide bombings that killed 34 people, including 9 bombers, in Riyadh, Suadi Arabia 030512.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.20
Rashwan and other Egyptian experts said that Adel has become Al-Qaeda's number 3 in command since becoming chief of military operations and succeeding Abu Hafs al-Masri.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.21
Al-Masri was killed during the war in Afghanistan.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.22
Adel was a top member in the Egyptian Islamic militant movement Al-Jihad.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.23
Al-Jihad was led by Zawahiri and carried out many attacks in Egypt in the 1990s.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.24
Adel left Egypt at the end of the 1980s for a Gulf Arab country, then traveled to Pakistan and then Afghanistan, where he helped train militants at some camps, Egyptian sources said on condition they not be named.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030522_0447.25
The Egyptian sources also said that Adel is close to both Zawahiri and bin Laden.

At least three other Egyptians were also on the list: Tharwat Salah Shehata, Tariq Anwar As-Sayyid Ahmad and Mohammad Salah.

Indian troops already fighting rebels are now also engaged in a massive operation to destroy poppy crops in Kashmir.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.7
Customs officials from the Federal Finance Ministry launched the campaign with security forces on 15 May 2003 in the southern Kashmir already affected by much violence.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.8
The campaign requires troops to confront angry residents desperate to earn a living and unaware they are violating the law.

Senior Customs Officer V. Prabhakar stated that in 2003 the troops have destroyed opium poppy crops dispersed over 224.73 hectares (556 acres) in 27 villages of Anantnag and Pulwama districts.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.10
A similar drive was carried out in 2002 in the same region but did not stop residents from replanting.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.11
Prabhakar stated --
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.12
The crop destruction of 2002 has not served as a deterrent.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.13
The State administration has been lax on the issue.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.14
No district official has ever taken steps to destroy the crop nor even reported that poppy crops are grown in his area.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.15
Villagers in this region approximately 30 kilometers (18 miles) south of Kashmir's summer capital Srinagar stated that cultivating poppy crops was their only livelihood.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.16
Farmer Ghulam Ahmed stated that he and other farmers have been growing poppy crops in their fields for years with no objection from anyone.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.17
Ahmed stated that residents were shocked when officials and troops started destroying their harvest.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.18
Many villagers grow poppy for their seeds used to flavor the Kashmiri bread known as kulcha.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.19
Kulcha is always in great demand across the Himalayan region.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.20
Bakers buy the seeds at 100 rupees (two U.S. dollars) per kilogram.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.21
The lucrative byproduct is poppy SAP which can be processed into opium.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.22
Rahti Begum was disconsolate as she watched her crop being destroyed.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.23
Begum who raises the 3 children of her late son stated that her poppy crop is her only source of income.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.24
Some officials admit the residents are not at fault.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.25
A State official told AFP --
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.26
These villagers are innocent.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.27
They cultivate the crop for poppy seeds unaware that its cultivation is punishable.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.28
The villagers are inadvertently involving themselves in drug trafficking.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.29
Officials state that because many farmers are unaware of these laws security forces make no arrests over poppy cultivation.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.30
Prabhakar states --
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.31
If the cultivation continues unrestrained Kashmir may soon become notorious for narcotics.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.32
This has potential serious consequences as Kashmiri youth may become addicted to narcotics grown in the region.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.33
Poppy cultivation at present is largely organized by groups who use their own trucks to transport the drugs for sale in other parts of India.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.34
In 2002 the Indian army seized 350 kilograms (772 pounds) of narcotics in the Kashmir Valley.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.35
He will intensify the anti-drug operation.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.36
Federal and state officials and non-governmental organizations should cooperate on the anti-drug campaign and could end the poppy trade in Kashmir.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.37
A crucial element of the campaign's success is education of the public.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030525_0181.38

PROXY_AFP_ENG_20030803_0475.6
The Los Angeles Times said the 3-month investigation drew on previously secret reports, international officials, independent experts, Iranian exiles and intelligence sources and uncovered strong evidence that Iran's commercial program masked a military undertaking.

Thailand's Defense Ministry has decided to develop and produce rockets and missiles.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070412_0483.5
Jane's Defence Weekly reported on 070412 that the Thai Government has decided to develop and produce rockets and missiles in a radical shift towards building an indigenous defense industry.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070412_0483.6
Jane's said the program would lift Thailand beyond the current capacity for producing explosives, ammunition and small arms under licence as well as modernizing and repairing aircraft and armored vehicles.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070412_0483.7
The Thai armed forces do not currently have any surface-to-surface missiles in their inventory.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070412_0483.8
Jane's cited an internal Thai Defense Ministry document which said Thailand will start by developing a multiple-launch rocket (MLR) with a range of 80 kilometers (48 miles).
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070412_0483.9
Jane's said there is already a project underway to develop a 160 millimeter MLR with a 40-kilometer range and that other projects include a strategic rocket with turbojet engine guided by Global Position System and inertial navigation system.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070412_0483.10
The Thai Ministry document says funding pressures on the defense budget and encouragement by unspecified sectors for greater self-sufficiency is driving the new program.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070412_0483.11
Such a rocket is significant because of the implication of efforts to develop a surface-to-surface missile with a range at the upper limit of the voluntary Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070412_0483.12
The MTCR is a global disarmament group involving the United States and 33 other members and was established in 870000 to control exports of missiles which can deliver weapons of mass destruction.

The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe was signed in Paris in 1990 and aimed at establishing defense parity in Europe.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070612_0180.9
The CFE came into force in 1992 and limits deployments of tanks and troops in countries belonging to NATO and the former Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070612_0180.10
Chief of the Russian delegation Anatoly Antonov stated in Vienna on 11 June 2007 that Russian officials called the meeting because the Russian Government is unable to freely move Russian troops on Russian territory.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070612_0180.11
Anotov referred to limitations imposed by the CFE and stated that the choice of which armed forces to deploy belongs to Russian officials.

The United Nations said on June 25, 2007 that sophisticated laboratories inside Afghanistan are converting 90 percent of Afghanistan's opium into heroin and morphine before smuggling it around the world.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070625_0217.6
The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said Afghanistan is the world's biggest producer of opium and had exported the illicit drug almost exclusively in its raw form until 2 years ago.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070625_0217.7
UNODC representative Christina Oguz in Kabul said that she believes the amount of the opium being processed in Afghanistan is approximately 90 percent.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070625_0217.8
Oguz said that anyone flying over the major opium producing areas would see a lot of small fires in the mountains, which are heroin labs.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070625_0217.9
Oguz stated that a couple of years ago opium was the primary drug being trafficked out of Afghanistan.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070625_0217.10
Oguz said there has been an increase of opium being processed into morphine and into heroin and that this indicates sophistication that was not previously present in Afghanistan.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070625_0217.11
Afghanistan accounts for 92 percent of the world's heroin supply despite vast internationally-backed efforts to eradicate its opium poppy fields.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070625_0217.12
Oguz said the annual income from the drugs trade helps finance the Taliban-led insurgency plaguing mainly southern and eastern Afghanistan and that this income totals more than three billion US dollars.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070625_0217.13
Oguz stated that the drugs have to be fought together with the insurgency.

Afghanistan produced a record 6000 tons of opium in 2006.

Officials said that the 2007 harvest could exceed the 2006 record because of an increase in opium cultivation in the southern provinces.

Oguz said that favorable weather conditions had also contributed to the increase.

The CFE is a key agreement that limits the deployment of forces in central and eastern Europe.

US moves to install anti-missile bases in the region were seen as a key cause of the decision.

The EU should immediately commence talks with India to prevent future sales of the alh, components or technology to India.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070715_0100.17
All future EU cooperation with India that could supply Myanmar with banned items should be discontinued.
PROXY_AFP_ENG_20070715_0100.18
