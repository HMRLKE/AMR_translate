Maybe the vows were different, however I'm highly doubting it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0025.6
In the end Newt is a pathological liar, and for him to be right about his second wife I'd have to take his word against his second wifes...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0025.7
He did cheat on her and leave her.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0025.8
Newt is not trustworthy on the subject matter of commitment and marriage or on any political position, so he has no credibility.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0025.9
Id take a moldy apples word over Newts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0025.10
Sex, lies and Twitter.

You sure you're a conservative?

That shit is meaningless to me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0026.1
I missed the debate BUT....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0026.2
WTF Newt
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0026.3
You republicans are a mess – you’ve no idea what you want.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0026.4
You ‘hate’ Obama and want to ‘get rid of him’ but you hate Romney, too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0026.5
When Gingrich tries to take Romney out, you complain about that as well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0026.6
Some of us know what we want.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0026.8
This nation would be in better shape now if Romney had been elected in 2008, and he is my choice now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0026.9
edit: I shouldn't reinforce the assumptions you made about people who oppose Romney but they simply don't apply at all to some of us.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0026.10
Not all of us "hate" Romney.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0027.1
Might be, but he really has no reason to be.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0027.2
He has more than enough money himself.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0027.5
But why would decieving them really get their support?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0027.6
I dont understand these politicians.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0027.7
Whats the point of getting "Supporters" if you get them dishonestly?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0027.8
They turn on you the first second they realize you are lying
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0027.9
This is why I can't stand Paul haters.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0027.10
They dislike one or maybe two things about Paul and it's allll over with for him...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0027.11
Then these same people run off and support self declared progressives (Newt and Mitt), then have a fit when it looks like Paul supporters might not vote for a morally and politically corrupted person like Newt, costing the Republicans their election.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0027.12
Is Paul perfect?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0027.13
No Is Newt even borderline meh?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0027.14
No Is Mitt really conservative?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0027.15
Lol, no maybe with his companies but not with his state.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0028.1
I appreciate the accomplishments Newt had during his term as speaker.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0028.2
Most importantly welfare to work and bringing the Gop to power.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0028.3
Working across the isle to create a balanced budget with a surplus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0028.4
I also like many of his current ideas.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0028.5
I don't like his soaring liberal rhetoric as it relates to Mitt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0028.6
This is the 3rd time I've answered this question all be it with less detail this time.

Please stop asking.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0028.8
Ok, thank you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0028.9
As far as I know it was the first time I have asked you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0028.10
I still will say Newt might have been *part* of the reason we got a balanced budget but remember Newt is a very real *part* of the reason we got the housing crisis and the DoEducation, among other Government growth that has helped bankrupt this country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0028.11
As a Paul fan I see Newt's best 5 minutes of his political life as just another day in Paul's political career.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0028.12
The housing crisis was set in motion long before Newt came along.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0028.13
As far as the Dep of Edu, I don't know anything about it or its origins.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0029.1
I'm watching the post debate coverage and can't believe my ears, AGAIN.

WTF?!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0029.5
I want to support Newt but he keeps spouting liberal hate lines.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0029.6
The only one that doesn't is Paul and Santorum.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0029.7
Paul won't win and Santorum, even if he did, is so polarizing that I don't know if he could beat Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0029.8
Newt is so desperate to beat Romney that it seems he will stoop to any level, including the anti capitalism liberal lines.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0029.9
I tell you Grampa, my head's spinning between Newt and Romney on this BS between them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886072_0029.10
I just read a press release, well grab this.

Even the Republicans are not even voting for him: just ask the voters in South Carolina.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886126_0017.7
In fact, I hope he gets elected if Obama does not get re-elected.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886126_0017.8

(But his actual record vis a vis Israel and the Global Warming hoax show he also has pretty bad ideas as well)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0014.31
So on balance, I have to say that given a choice between Romney and Romney care and Newt and his affection for all his weird baggage with PBS, Global Warming, playing footsie with various flaky arab regimes...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0014.32
I prefer Santorum.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0014.33
But Newt's conjugal craziness is not part of my decision tree.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0014.35
Well said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0014.36
I for one am getting weary of so called "dirt" being dug up on candidates private sexual lives from one decade ago let alone many decades ago.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0014.37
And it's actually becoming pitiful to watch the political press become TMZ with old bitter women who have an axe to grind.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0037.1
Clinton wasn't impeached for sex, but for lying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0037.2
He was disbarred for lying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0037.3
The bar for democrats is pretty low.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0037.4
What they have to overcome is that even though Bill Clinton was a world class wife cheater, and a liar, he was still a fairly effective president.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0037.5
His personal difficulties of keeping his privates in his pants didn't make him a bad president.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0037.6
There is the democrat quandry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0038.1
There is nothing weird about it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0038.2
It's the good old double standard.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0038.3
Clinton wasn't just a philanderer, he was a world class sexual pervert enabled by his wife who is now the secretary of state.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0038.4
And Clinton had a string of women going all the way back to Paula Jones, when he was governor and then a long relationship with Gennifer Flowers and others and all before he was president, I think.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0038.5
The public knew of these women and so did Hillary, and Bill Clinton still became president, and continued with his follies until he was impeached.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0038.6
I don't feel that any of his infideliities made him a lesser president.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0038.7
In fact, I think they helped.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0038.8
He was a good looking man with power and lust for young beautiful women, and it all worked well for him, until it didn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0038.9
Newt is a changed man and I don't believe he would ever be a serial womanizer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0038.10
He has been married since 2000 to Calista, and had a relationship with her for 6 years prior.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0038.11
It will be interesting to see how it all plays out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0038.12
But Newt knew this would come up, before he tossed his hat in the ring, and I am sure he will be a better man regardless of how it ends.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0038.13
I don't think Newt's sex life is relevant, and I don't care about Bill Clinton's blow job either.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0039.7
Say what you want but the only reason he was even put into the position for lying is that the puritanical neo-cons were chasing down sex rumors (and spending millions of taxpayer dollars in the process).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0039.8
And Newt was one of them leading the charge.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0039.9
So when someone says, "It wasn't about the blowjob, it was about lying", it was about the blowjob.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.1
Actually, I think your instance on it being the blow job is the it was all about states rights rather than slavery deal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.2
And hypocrisy in politics is not that big a deal either.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.3
All the efforts and bribes etc etc were to avoid the loss of the civil rights case.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.4
It wasn't just the issue of he got a blow job from a dim intern.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.5
It was that you got your job by going down.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.6
do we really want government officials appointed on the casting couch?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.7
And if you said no, then you were out of a job.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.8
Blow job or no job.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.9
And the man was a feminist icon.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.10
What kind of feminism is that that promotes that kind of employment 'opportunity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.12
If you can swallow that it was 'just a blow job' than you swallow everything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.13
Now, fellatio aside, did Clinton's tomcatting gett in the way of his job?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.14
By all accounts, he was good at multitasking.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.15
Is this really all that relavent to his job performance?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.16
Now if you could find proof that he was sleeping with someone from the Mafia or the KGB, that would be interesting sexual exchanges.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.17
Or that he was sleeping with lobbyist as payment for legislation, that would be interesting and worthwhile to discuss.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.21
The Cons can say what they want but yes, it was about the blowjob.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.22
And now they want to turn a blind eye to Newt's philandering and desire for an open marriage?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.23
Pure hypocrisy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.24
Telling yourself that it was about the blow job allows you to howl hypocrisy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.25
Facing the truth of the matter, that he treated women like dirt and that if a woman had the courage to say no to him she had better shop the resume is beyond you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.26
But we still face the question of what is more important to us as citizens.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0040.27
Voting for incompetent and uxorious like Carter and Obama, or voting for comptent slime like Clinton and Gringrich.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.1
I'm in a bit of a quandary on this one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.2
Fundamentally, everyone is entitled to a private life and - no matter who they are - they have a right not to have their personal life dragged through the mud for political point scoring or for the general consumption of the public.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.3
Having said that, I do feel that...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.4
if one is capable of treating one's own family so badly, or one breaks the vows of marriage...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.5
then why should I trust that person to take their oath of office seriously?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.6
If people cheat on their life partner, they are unlikely to treat anyone else any better.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.7
And for me is that I could not care less if a man has a girlfriend on the side or 100 girlfriends (or even boyfriends) on the side.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.8
I never did care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.9
None of that, to me, translates into his ability to do the right things in office and it never has.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.10
But for years all we ever heard about was Clinton's morals and now it seems that all of the sudden morals don't matter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.11
There's a lot of inconsistency on this one and I have no problem pointing it out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.12
Obviously to the voters it didn't matter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.13
Fully aware of Gennifer flowers millions voted for him anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.14
If you want to play this game, if it didn't matter than, it doesn't matter now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0041.15
You can't play the game of "I didn't think it mattered then, but now I do."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0042.3
So you think everyone just lies to you or that we are all just so confused we cant fathom what our reasons are for wanting Clinton impeached?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0042.4
lol
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0043.25
Yeah, its a classic libtard dodge, isnt it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0043.26
Make up what you think your opponents *really* mean and then slam them for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0043.28
We critisize Clinton for being a philanderer who used his power to get sex and the libtards just assume that we really dont have a problem with that but it *must* be something else.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0043.29
Wonder why that is?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0043.32
The fact is that some of the best leaders throughout history have been philandering drunkards.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0043.33
When you need a leader, you can be forgiven for over-looking a few things.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0043.34
Rape isnt one of them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0044.1
So, i guess the population of divorced people shouldn't qualify for office.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0044.2
After all, they couldn't keep their vows for life.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0056.1
This is the type of politics Newt, himself, founded.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0056.2
He's got a huge set of balls to complain about it now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0056.3
Seriously.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0057.4
Well said.......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0057.6
You must spread some Reputation around before giving it to Sallow again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0058.5
Soooooo..........
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0058.6
First of all it was about the blowjob.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0058.8
Then it was about the lying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0058.10
Now what is it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0058.12
Lying about the blowjob.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0059.1
Denying that is like a redneck denying the Civil War was about slavery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0059.2
Not to change the subject; but the Civil War was about "States Rights" and not slavery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0059.4
The States' right to have slaves.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0059.5
It's in each and every one of the Confederate states' constitutions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0060.34
Problem is clinton did something no other president did, he violated the oval office by having sex thaere and then lying about it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0060.35
You did not mention that why?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0060.36
Problem no.2, people want to hang Newt out to dry but still kiss old mr. monicas behind.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0061.15
Ok.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0061.16
now we're back to the blowjob again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0061.17
I wish you bastards would make up your mind.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0063.4
Actually it was about states rights to have slavery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0063.5
Slavery was the reason the states wanted to have states rights.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0064.4
"founded"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886306_0064.5
You really think he pioneered this kind of politics?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.1
History as taught and learned by the left wing propagandists will likely be kind to President Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.2
But if they were honest and objective, they wouldn't be.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.3
This is part of why stooges like you cannot see even a glimmer of reality.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.4
So you agree that if only 10% of what hacks like you say were true then our wonderful country would have folded in 1777?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.5
Or did I confuse you with someone with a different critical thinking skill set?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.6
No, moron.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.7
Unlike idiots like you, I don't subscribe to the positively retarded notion that those who disagree with chumps like you are "hacks."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.8
I read the drivel bullshit spew you posted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.9
Ergo, it is clear that it is you who are the hack.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.10
And no.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.11
The Country did well in terms of setting the foundation for what has lasted so far almost 240 years BECAUSE they subscribed to the things I believe and those whom morons like YOU consider "hacks" believe.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.12
You wouldn't RECOGNIZE a critical thinking skill set, ya dickweed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.13
You'd have to be able to think on your own.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.14
Clearly, you can't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.15
My, my. This is a positive thread about the Prez as some here said never happens and bam, the idiots show up and try and make it about themselves and how they view their perceived terribleness of 'Murica.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.16
For shame, for shame.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0024.17
Like I said earlier, if only 10% of the horseshit you rightwing bitches said were true then our wonderful country would have folded like a cheap suit in or about 1777.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0025.1
I sometimes wonder if when Pelosi and Reid took over Congress and spent most of their time investigating and undermining Bush that they also purposefully took their eye's off the ball and the growing economic problems of the country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0025.2
How could they miss the inevitable housing bubble that most Americans suspected all along, given that they were directly responsible and had the inside scoop for instance?

Bush warned them several times but they refused to act...

If Reid and Pelosi had actually investigated gwb as you claim and I wished then he and many of his administration and other war criminals would now be in prison.

Another oddity with Pelosi & Reid is the unemployment figures, after 1 year of Democrat control and the last of the Republican budgets past away, the unemployment figures started growing precipitously.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0025.7
I suppose it's against the rules for Democrats to question these things...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0025.8
I understand just blaming Bush is the simplest of answers, no thought required...

He's brought dignity back to the Office.

The Worst Economic Recovery Since The Great Depression
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.2
The record of President Obama’s first three years in office is in, and nothing that happens now can go back and change that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.3
What that record shows is that President Obama, with his throwback, old-fashioned, 1970s Keynesian economics, has put America through the worst recovery from a recession since the Great Depression.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.4
The recession started in December, 2007.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.5
Go to the website of the National Bureau of Economic Research ( <a href="http://www.nber.org">The National Bureau of Economic Research</a> ) to see the complete history of America’s recessions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.6
What that history reveals is that before this last recession, since the Great Depression recessions in America have lasted an average of 10 months, with the longest previously lasting 16 months.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.7
When President Obama entered office in January, 2009, the recession was already in its 13th month.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.8
His responsibility was to manage a timely, robust recovery to get America back on track again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.9
Based on the historical record, that recovery was imminent, within a couple of months or so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.10
Despite widespread fear, nothing fundamental had changed to deprive America of the long term, world-leading prosperity it had enjoyed going back 300 years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.11
Supposedly a forward looking progressive, Obama proved to be America’s first backward looking regressive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.12
His first act was to increase federal borrowing, the national debt and the deficit by nearly a trillion dollars to finance a supposed “stimulus” package, based on the discredited Keynesian theory left for dead 30 years ago holding that increased government spending, deficits and debt are what promote economic growth and recovery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.13
That theory arose in the 1930s as the answer to the Great Depression, which, of course, never worked.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.14
That was the beginning of President Obama’s Rip Van Winkle act, pretending not to know anything that happened over the previous 30 years proving the dramatic, historic success of the new, more modern, supply side economics, which holds that incentives for increased production are what promote economic growth and recovery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.15
Indeed, that Rip Van Winklism pretended not to remember the 1970s either, when double digit inflation and double digit unemployment proved Keynesian economics grievously wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.16
As should have been long expected, Obama’s trillion dollar Keynesian stimulus did nothing to promote recovery and growth, and almost surely delayed it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.17
That is because borrowing a trillion dollars out of the economy to spend a trillion back into it does nothing to promote the economy on net.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.18
Indeed, it is probably a net drag on the economy, because the private sector spends the money more productively and efficiently than the public sector.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.19
The National Bureau of Economic Research scored the recession as ending in June, 2009.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.20
Yet, today, in the 49th month since the recession started, there has still been no real recovery, like recoveries from previous recessions in America.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.21
Unemployment actually rose after June, 2009, and did not fall back down below that level until 18 months later in December, 2010.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.22
Instead of a recovery, America has suffered the longest period of unemployment near 9% or above since the Great Depression, under President Obama’s public policy malpractice.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.23
Even today, 49 months after the recession started, the U6 unemployment rate counting the unemployed, underemployed and discouraged workers is still 15.2%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.24
And that doesn’t include all the workers who have fled the workforce under Obama’s economic oppression.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.25
The unemployment rate with the full measure of discouraged workers is reported at <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com">Shadow Government Statistics : Home Page</a> as about 23%, which is depression level unemployment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.26
Today, over 4 years since the recession started, there are still almost 25 million Americans unemployed or underemployed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.27
That includes 5.6 million who are long-term unemployed for 27 weeks, or more than 6 months.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.28
Under President Obama, America has suffered the longest period with so many in such long-term unemployment since the Great Depression.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.29
Notably, blacks have been suffering another depression under Obama, with unemployment today, 49 months after the recession started, still at 15.8%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.30
Black unemployment has been over 15% for 2 ½ years under Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0031.31
Black teenage unemployment today is over 40%, where it has persisted for over 2 years as well.

Sorry, liar, but the case that was brought and won against the NBP was DISMISSED by the direct orders of the RACIST Eric Holder.

The Bush administration’s Justice Department — not the Obama administration — made the decision not to pursue criminal charges against members of the New Black Panther Party for alleged voter intimidation at a polling center in Philadelphia in 2008

The U.S. Department of Justice seal bears a Latin phrase: "Qui Pro Domina Justitia Sequitur."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0091.7
The motto refers to the attorney general, "who prosecutes on behalf of Lady Justice."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0091.8
But under President Barack Obama's politically corrupt DOJ, Lady Justice is getting the shaft.

Let me tell you why.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0091.13
Two weeks ago, in a highly unusual move, Holder dismissed default judgments his department had won against two of three defendants charged with violating the Voting Rights Act.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0103.25
Everyone else thinks so but you 40% who still approve of him...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0103.26
so lets get real dear..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0104.25
Bush INSTITUTED it sweetheart...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0104.26
what did you, or do you think about that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0104.27
He STARTED the dismantling of the Constitution.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0104.28
What say you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0105.26
And Obama's continuing it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0105.27
But don't you DARE criticize Dear Reader.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0106.11
Where's YOUR criticism of Shrub twinkle toes?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0107.8
I've criticized him many times, for not wielding his veto pen nearly enough, for not fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan aggressively enough, and for spending money like a drunken Democrat.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0107.9
Where's your criticism of SCOAMF?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0108.26
If Bush started it how do you explain Clinton bombing Kosovo if Bush was the first president to ignore the constitution?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0109.6
I was pretty pissed he didn't put up Public Option, he didn't fight hard enough for Health Care Reform.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0109.7
I think he gave and gives the Republicans too much leeway, in other words he doesn't fight then nearly enough.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0109.8
He agrees with them too much.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0109.9
He didn't shut down gitmo.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0109.10
However, I temper that with the realization that said Republicans are fighting him tooth and nail on everything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0110.9
awww poor poor Obama, those meanie Republicans are standing in your way of greatness..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0110.10

I dunno seems to be some guy who is trying to push his glasses back a bit....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0111.6
probably needs to have them adjusted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0112.9
You praise him with faint damns.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0112.10
"He isn't far moonbat left enough!!"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0112.12
You just make sure you keep blaming Republicans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886422_0112.13
Don't hold Dear Reader accountable for anything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0016.1
By far the best debater and most informed candidate and could easily kick Obama's ass in a debate...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0016.2
Turned Clinton from a deficit spending President in a fortunate economy to a budget surplus and Democrat pro-sexual harassment hero..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0016.3
Soo..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0016.4
what's your beef with this Guy...?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0016.5
I have no beef with him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0016.6
At least he told the truth and said that the budget was BALANCED during Bill Clinton's presidency.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0017.7
Clinton never balanced the budget.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0017.8
The only thing he balanced was interns.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0018.7
And who forced it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0018.8
It wasn't Clinton.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0019.9
Yup..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0019.10
Clinton went along with it kicking and screaming but then experienced that typical Democratic long term/short term memory loss and took full credit..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0020.1
You know what I love about nutters?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0020.2
They are not hypocitical at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0020.3
They are always consistent....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0020.4
always.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0021.1
Yeah, I think Newt should win the primary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0021.2
No really.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0022.9
Wait.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0022.10
Where's your copy paste on this issue?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0023.8
Indeed...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0023.9
and in his re-election Bid?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0023.10
Clinton was forced to do the Potamic Two-step Electric Slide to the center like a good politician.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0024.7
Wha....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0024.8
You learned to read????
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0025.5
My main beef is his hypocrisy going after Clinton for an affair.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0025.6
I don't trust him to put the nation before politics.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0026.1
I have no rep left but I have 1 vote.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0026.2
And Newt will get it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0027.1
Wut?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0028.7
Do you really believe that is what prompted the investigation?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0029.5
Don't have one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0029.6
He's already my choice, assuming he's still in by the time my state's primary rolls around.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0030.1
In the primary my vote will go to Newt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0030.2
That is who I think that can kick Obama's ass in a debate and an election
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0030.3
More importantly (if not more urgently), I think his plans for getting our country out of the mess it's in are really good.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.1
I didn't realize Bill Clinton was impeached for adultery?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.2
I thought it was because he lied to a grand jury and used his office to influence others to lie?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.3
Amazing what you can learn on the internet
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.5
Technically, you are right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.6
Practically, nobody cared.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.7
Because every MAN in this country would have told the exact same lie if asked.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.8
People forgave Clinton for the lying because the question never should have been asked in the first place.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.9
Just like they thought the "hi-tech" lynching of Clarance Thomas was wrong 7 years earlier.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.10
Interrogating people about their sex lives isnt' kosher to a lot of people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.11
Now, in the interest of complete fairness, Clinton brought most of his troubles down on himself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.12
He should have settled with Paula Jones years earlier.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.13
And he got a whole lot of millage out of sexual harrassment BS at the time of the Thomas hearings.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.14
But all the real damage was done when Lewinsky's name came out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.15
By pressing the issue, the Republicans made themselves look bad.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.16
I find it interesting that you probscribe your personal values to "practically" everybody.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.17
I would suggest that a few more than "nobody" cared.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.18
Using executive privelege to lure women into sexual relationships is at best, sleazy...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.19
At worst, corrupt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.20
Maybe a few of the problems in this country are caused by people who give a pass to the sleazy and corrupt?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.21
If a BJ was the biggest concern of the nation with the president right now-the whole country would be a lot better.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.22
I mean seriously Clinton was 100X better than W. Bush and Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.23
You're also VERY naive if you think any modern president isn't/wasn't corrupt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0079.24
They all are/were on some level.

Back to my boy, Newt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.2
I LOVE hearing him talk in these debates.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.3
He makes the other candidates sound like a bunch of kids squabbling over the last Popsicle.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.4
Check out the way Newt discussed Herman Cain's 999 plan.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.5
He started by commending and complimenting Cain, and then raised objections to the plan without ONCE denigrating Cain, or even sounding like he was denigrating the plan.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.6
He sounds so statesmanlike.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.7
I've been following his website postings about the legislation he would propose as President.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.8
It's really good, and quite innovative in places.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.9
And I like his plan for his first Executive Order as President to be abolishing all "czars" in the federal government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.10
You like intelligence and a President who speaks in full sentences?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.11
We agree.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.12
But.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.13
then you say you like the plan to abolish czars.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.14
Don't you know that this is just a piece of grandstanding nonsense?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.15
You like intelligence and good speaking?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.16
I hadn't noticed, given your election of Barack Oteleprompter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.17
What I know about abolishing the czars is that they're Unconstitutional and have no business having power in our federal government, and thus, I know that it's an excellent idea to return that power to the people duly elected or appointed in accordance with law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0080.18
But as I mentioned earlier, I realize that laws are just suggestions to be ignored at will to leftists, so I don't expect you to understand why they're so important to the rest of us.

Newt Gingrich: 2012 Campaign Staff Exodus Makes Me 'Feel Liberated' · 06/15/11
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0081.6
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said during an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday night that he feels "liberated" by the mass exodus of staffers from his presidential campaign.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0081.7
Last week, news of aides jumping ship from the Gingrich 2012 political operation sent shockwaves across the political spectrum.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0081.8
Campaign manager Rob Johnson and spokesman Rick Tyler were just two of numerous members of the presidential candidate's team to resign.

When "the best debater" and "most informed candidate" can't even convince his own campaign manager and spokesman to stay with his campaign at this early date - then something is definitely wrong!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0081.11
When a mass exodus of staffers makes a presidential candidate feel "liberated" - then someone is out of touch with reality and my money is on the Newt!

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.1
In addition to the adultery?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.2
Newt is one of those guys who says he loves America but seems to hate Americans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.3
In the 1990's there was a news story about a woman whose baby was cut out of her belly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.4
The rest of us were recoiling at the horror of people, individuals, who could do that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.5
Newt was pontificating about the seething underbelly of the welfare society.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.6
Newt has no heart.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.7
He has a brain and a weenie.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.8
And the weenie obviously overrules the brain more often than it should.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.9
At least that's how he comes across often, and that's baggage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.10
I'm not his wife, and I'm not looking to date him, so I really don't consider his marital relationships, past or present, to be any of my business.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.11
And I really don't think now is the time to be quibbling about trivial bullshit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.12
Our nation is in trouble, and to be blunt, I think anyone who's worried about "he's not a very nice or likable guy" at a time like this deserves to have their nation fall apart around them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.13
Now, show me evidence that Mr. Gingrich violated the law, a la former President Horndog, and we'll talk.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.14
You're pointing at the marital infidelity side of the equation and poopooing us holding that against him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.15
Republicans don't get to poopoo that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.16
We've let the religious right carry the torch for us for so long that we are the preacher party.

Newt burned his morality card and that's baggage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.21
But for me it's way more than the adultery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.22
It's his hatefulness and lack of empathy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.23
That's more than not being "likable".

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.26
Back during the ground zero mosque upheaval he said something else which showed me that he hadn't learned his lesson, and which can be held against him in soundbites and on a deeper level.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.27
I don't remember the details and am not going to look it up at this time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.28
I don't need to now because he's not a contender so I don't have to worry about him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.29
Newt burnt his bridges with me long ago and I'm glad he's not a contender now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.30
What makes you think I'm a Republican?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0090.31
Furthermore, please refer back to what I said earlier: if you're worried about his personality at a time like this, you deserve to have your country fall apart around you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0091.2
You asked about baggage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0091.3
You don't get to define the terms about what should or should not be baggage and say "we'll talk" as if your terms make the baggage no more.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0091.4
Baggage IS, whether you think it is logical or not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0091.5
And Gingrich has it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0091.6
Yes, because there are a lot of shallow halfwits in this country who've been weaned on The National Inquirer and now don't seem to know how to differentiate between politicians and celebrities and set priorities when it comes to elections.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0091.7
I don't get to tell you what inane bullshit you can or can't value over little things like issues, positions, and plans, but I sure as hell DO get to tell you that your "baggage" is a load of crap if that's what I think.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0091.8
And I do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0091.9

He cheated on his wife, then compared her to a car: · A few months after she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, Marianne Gingrich confronted Newt, and he admitted he was having an affair (with Callista Bisek, then 32, a former Hill staffer who later became his third wife).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0143.5
The couple tried to talk through it, but Gingrich got stuck comparing his wife and lover to cars, saying Marianne was a Jaguar and all he wanted was a Chevrolet.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0143.6
"I can't handle a Jaguar right now," Gingrich said several times.

The most notorious incident in Gingrich's marriage...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0143.10
was when he cornered Jackie in her hospital room where she was recovering from uterine cancer surgery and insisted on discussing the terms of the divorce he was seeking.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0143.11
Shortly after that infamous encounter, Gingrich refused to pay his alimony and child-support payments.

The First Baptist Church in his hometown had to take up a collection to support the family Gingrich had deserted.

Six months after divorcing Jackie, Gingrich married a younger woman, Marianne, with whom he had been having an affair.

It's from people who worked with him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0148.32
Newt has admitted to most of what you would deny.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0148.33
And he came up with a wacky excuse for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0148.34
He just loved the country too much.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0148.36
Newt is not stable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0157.1
His personal life aside--that is only fair since apparently only Republicans are fair game to have their personal lives closely scrutinized and criticized--Newt is by far the best educated, has the highest IQ, and the most impressive knowledge, recall ability, and vision of any of the candidates running this year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0157.2
In his professional life he has pulled two major blunders.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0157.3
One was in taking on the dishonest and corrupt James Wright and forcing his resignation over a book deal in the Reagan Administration and then writing his own book which of course triggered the same kinds of accusations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0157.4
Hypocrisy is allowed on the left, but is not to be tolerated on the right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0157.5
The second was the same sort of thing when he imprudently forced the impeachment of President Clinton on grounds that most of us didn't think rose the the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0157.6
Those grounds had nothing to do with Monica Lewinsky, but the left, having a less sophisticated constituency, was able to make it look like it did and then could trash Newt from engaging in his own infidelity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0157.7
More hypocrisy that is allowed on the left, but is not to be tolerated on the right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0157.8
Can Newt live down that kind of baggage in a head to head contest with Barack Obama?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0157.9
Given that the MSM will play up all of Newt's baggage while continuing to ignore Obama's, I don't know.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0157.10
Newt right now is not my favorite of the candidates, but I wouldn't have to hold my nose to vote for him a year from November, and he would be heads and shoulders above the current occupant of the White House.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0157.11
He's also just about as big a bigot and racist as Pat Buchanan.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0157.12
Who's also very smart and savvy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0158.1
You really believe that the impeachment was on solid ground?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0158.2
No.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0158.3
As I said Clinton was absolutely guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice to the detriment of a private citizen and that is indefensible and was enough to get him suspended from the bar in the Supreme Court, in Arkansas, and charged with contempt of court in New York.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0158.4
But it did not, in my opinion, rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors that justified impeachment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0158.5
The Senate seemed to be of that same opinion as, even though Republican controlled, chose not to convict him and force him out of office.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0158.7
Yeah..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0158.8

I'm sure in your mind he is Sallow.

Most leftists buy into all the hate stuff put out there on somebody like Newt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0159.15
I have not seen any bigotry or racism in Gingrich however, nor in Buchanan for that matter--Buchanan has been right on the edge of anti-semitism a time or two however--but both have focused mostly on the truth of the human condition which, to the left, is not allowed in our politically correct world.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0160.1
Clintons transgressions appear to be forgiven by the left.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0160.2

I have also read what both have written on the subject.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0164.13
And your take is mean spirited and based on the leftist political correct notion that the white race or the American/European culture is NEVER to be recognized for any accomplishments and anyone who presumes to do so shall be branded white supremacist and/or racist.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0223.11

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.10
2) The Boland Amendment, which was what was broken here, had no criminal penalty or enforcement procedures.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.11
3) Bonus cut- The Boland Amendment only forbade budget funds from going to the contras.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.12
It did not forbid the profits of other ventures from going to them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.13
Which is why no one was actually ever charged with sending arms to the Contras.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.14
They were charged with things like "lying to Congress" when Congress knew damned well what was going on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.16
I'm shocked that there's gambling going on here!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.17
And another: mining the harbors in Nicaragua was an act of war.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.18
The harbor was secretly mined, no one was told, and when Barry Goldwater found out about it, he tore Reagan administration officials a new one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.19
Wasn't this when Barry was also claiming he believed in UFO's?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.20
Who cared what that senile old jerk thought at that point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.21
You can thump your chest and pretend that you like the President to break the law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.22
But you can't pretend that what the Bush administration did, or what the Reagan administration did, was legal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.23
And if my dad was the guy who had a gun held to his head by a crazed Jihadi, I wouldn't care that Reagan did something "illegal" to save his life.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.24
Nor would you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.25
This is our system of government, under the USC.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.26
Have you heard of it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.27
And the Congress was free to impeach.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.28
Oh, but wait, they didn't do that!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.29
Because they weren't going to go out and impeach a president for not letting the commies win.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.30
The judge accepted Fitzgerald's evidence that Plame was covert.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.31
But again, no one was charged with that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.32
Cute, but stupid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.33
The CIA is the authority on their agents.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.34
If they say she's covert, she's covert.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.35
So if they shoot you and say you were an enemy spy, you'd take that on face value, too?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.36
Her name being in Who's Who is irrelevant.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.37
Deal with the reality here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.38
Her name was known.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.39
That she was a covert agent was not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0232.40
Except half of Washington knew she worked at the CIA and she was pulled out of Russia because the Russians knew who she was.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.1
Jackie Gingrich, Newt and his first wife's daughter, however have refuted the story of him "divorcing his wife when she was battling cancer".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.2
Jackie said--I'm thinking in a Larry King interview but can't remember for sure--that it was her mother who requested the divorce and the tumor was benign, not cancer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.3
He did start dating Marriane before the divorce was final and was cheating on Marianne when he confessed that infidelity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.4
However those who condemn Newt's personal life, which was pretty scuzzy, don't seem to have a problem with President Clinton's affair with Gennifer Flowers, various other 'bimbo eruptions, and getting blow jobs in the Oval Office and don't seem to think that impaired his ability to preside.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.5
So either there is a huge double standard at play here or Newt's infidelities don't matter either.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.6
How about it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.7
Republicans are the preacher party.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.8
So Republicans have to live up to that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.9
Republicans are the bulk of the ones who claimed that Clinton's infidelities mattered.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.10
I know a few Democrats spoke out against him but they were few and far between.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.11
I personally think that if Hyde hadn't rushed the matter through the House there might have been more time for some of the more serious allegations to be substantiated and for other people who had been keeping silent to speak up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.12
There might even have been official rape charges to contend with, not just rumors.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.13
But Hyde did rush it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.14
And basically the Republicans looked mean for it, so they justly have to carry extra baggage around with them when they transgress traditional mores.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.15
Eneeeway...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.16
some people do object to both Gingrich and Clinton.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.17
But it's not necessarily an incorrect double standard to condemn one and not the other.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.18
Republicans are the ones who said it mattered.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.19
If you live by the sword, you die by the sword.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.20
Democrats can have their Clintons and their Weiners and move on from it more quickly than we can.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.21
It's just plain not the indictment of their party which Republican cheaters are of ours.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.22
I am one who said the infidelities did not affect Clinton's ability to president any more than it affected FDR or JFK that we KNOW fooled around and some others for whom there are suspicions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.23
And while I do not condone anybody cheating on his/her spouse, and do think it calls their character into question, I am nevertheless fully qualified to comment on the reverse hypocrisy when Democrats didn't condemn their own but hold Republicans to a higher standard.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0233.24
Most especially when they have repeatedly accused us of condemning Clinton for the 'blow jobs' instead of the actual offenses.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0234.1
The famous sixteen words were taken out of the SOTU address Bush gave because the intell to back it up was not there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0234.2
The Bush administration put them back in.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0234.3
The famous 16 words were correct.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0234.4
The British did have evidence the Iraqis were trying to buy uranium.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0234.5
MI-6 stood by that statement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0234.6
So it was an accurate statement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0234.7
they didn't get it, but they asked for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0234.8
Look, guy, George Tenat went into Bush's office and said "It's a slam dunk, Mr. President!"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0234.9
Joe Wilson wrote in the LA Times that no only did Saddam have WMD's, but we needed to give him a graceful way out because he'd use them.

This is a lot of people playing CYA when something goes wrong.

If you had a real job, you see it happens every day in the business world, who ends up holding the bag of dog poop.

Myself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0234.13
Saddam was a scumbag and I'm glad he's dead.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0234.14
Aren't you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0235.25
The fact that Gingrich said it matters makes his case different from Clinton's.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0235.26
A free country must have honest leaders if it is to remain free.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0235.27
We are in deep trouble as a society...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0235.28
People are looking for a guidepost as to how they should live, how their institutions should behave, and who they should follow.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0235.29
That was in connection with the page scandals of 1983.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0235.30
He stitched up his own baggage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0235.31
He has to carry it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0235.32
It's good of you to try to be fairminded, but Gingrich made his Samsonite.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0235.33
Deliberately and methodically.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0235.34
Now he has to carry it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0267.12
Wow, you have totally drank the kool-aid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0267.13
Next, you're gonna tell us that Saddam was behind 9/11.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0267.18
Not at the cost of over $1 Trillion and over 5,000 U.S. military deaths.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0267.19
HELL NO!!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0268.20
Well then-what is your opinion on us getting involved in Libya?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0269.5
I believe I have already stated that I think anyone who's focusing on personal shit that's between him and his ex-wife is a dumbfuck who deserves to have the nation crumble around him while he pretends the President is just another celebrity to paparazzi to death.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0269.6
Of course, I think you're a dumbfuck no matter what happens, so feel free to carry on your inane drivel indefinitely.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0269.7
You probably believe that anyone who makes you look foolish is a dumbfuck, so I'm OK with it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0272.19
My opinion is that Bush spent $1 T rillion to get Saddam.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0272.20
Obama spent $1 B illion to get Gaddafi.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0272.21
Looks like Obama has plenty of CEO-type executive experience to me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0273.1
I put the words they probably said...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0273.2
because they are the only ones that make sense.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0273.3
Grow a fuckin' sense of humor, for crying out loud.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0273.4
When you have to make heroes out of under-acheiving affirmative action hires, you know you are really kind of weak in the hero department.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0273.5
Yes, I know.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0273.6
The words that made sense to you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0273.7
The dialogue from the movie in your head.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0273.8
Meanwhile, we've got a real world going on out here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0273.9
Everyone in the real world thought she was lying through her teeth...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0274.20
Two points.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0274.21
1) The Democrats looked at the same evidence,and came to the same conclusions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0274.22
2) So you are saying that it wasn't worth it if it went over a certain cost.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0274.23
Good thing you werne't around during WWII.

Back then it was a united country..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0310.22
today is weaker because of the self righteous press of Vietnam, Korea and relive a past
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.1
The only thing that was indefensible was Clinton's total sloth on the Bin Laden problem.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.2
If he didn't need a distraction, he didn't give a shit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.3
This is a baseless claim, to distract from my point about Clarke.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.4
No, it's a dead on claim.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.5
He bombed the Aspirin factory in 1998 (which turned out to have nothing to do with Bin Laden) the week he revealed he had been lying to us for eight months about Lewinsky.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.6
Then he never, ever mentioned it again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.7
Then Clarke, whom NON ONE EVER HEARD OF pops out of the woodwork and says, "I told Condi about Bin Laden, and she looked at me funny", when in fact, there are numerous taped interviews where it was clear Condi knew all about Bin Laden.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.8
So Clarke did really nothing under Clinton, and whined that he didn't get a promotion after Bush took over.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.9
Not even a good dodge.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.10
Answer the question- why didn't your side hold ONE Senator accountable for voting for the war on your own side?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.11
It's a good response to a really ridiculous comment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.12
You seem to be holding me personally accountable for how all Democrats voted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.13
Are you crazy?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.14
Desperate?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.15
What?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.16
No, it's not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.17
I was pointing out the hypocrisy of your party colletively, not you personally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.18
Collectively, your party nominated Kerry in 2004 because he voted for the war, and in 2006, you didn't vote out one Senator who had voted for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.19
Not one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.20
You did try to go after poor Joe Leiberman because he ignored the "War Bad Now" memo.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.21
But even managed to survive as an independent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.22
Okay, make it easy for you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.23
Explain why I should give a shit about any of it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.24
Because you understand the basic nature of the nation that you live in.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.25
I do understand it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.26
We have one party that does the bidding of the rich, and another one that is trying to make as many of us dependent on the government as humanly possible.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.27
So it's really a case of "choose your serfdom".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0311.28
What nation do you think we live in?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0312.5
Okay, Lumpy, I'm ready now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0312.6
I'm ready to start listening to what people have to say good for the guy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0312.7
Has anyone been saying anything good about him?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0312.8
More specific than how smart he is?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0312.9
I haven't been paying attention to the whole thread.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0312.10
Lotsa noise in it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0312.11
But if you have, could you summarize the high points?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0312.12
What does Newt plan for the nation starting in 2013?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0312.13
I'm ready to listen!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0313.15
I was kinda asking for the beefs, there's beefs a plenty...

I haven't read the whole thread.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0313.18
I did notice a theme of whining about his marital problems which seems odd to me coming from liberals.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0313.19
They seem to want to keep Republicans on a moral pedestal so that they can simultaneously tear it down.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0313.20
I think Democrats have been successful in down grading religious faith and morals down to a bigots paradise.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0313.21
They use religion as a weapon..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0313.22
it just not appropriate..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0313.23
Sorry I can't summarize the high points...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0313.24

See what your thread has become my friend Lumpster?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0317.23
If I had more time I'd figure it out but I suspect hypocrisy and liberal forked tongue desperation played a large part...

ole Buddy...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.1
You never heard of Clarke, but that's because you're not particularly well informed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.2
There's a record of Clarke attempting to get the Bushies to pay attention to bin Laden.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.3
They held a meeting, FINALLY, shortly before 9/11.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.4
Bush received a memo shortly before 9/11 called
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.5
That would be the same memo that called a hijacking plot NOT credible.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.6
In fact, Bush rightfully said after that breifing that gave him no new information, "Well, you've covered your ass."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.7
Clark was a non-entity in an administration that just saw terrorism as a way to take attention away from bimbo eruptions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.8
This is mind blowingly stupid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.9
Do you remember 9/11?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.10
Do you grasp that Clarke and Clinton were right about bin Laden, and Bush and Condi were wrong?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.11
We nominated Kerry because he voted for the war?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.13
Well, you could have nominated Howard Dean, who was against the war from the get-go.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.14
You didn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.15
Because you didn't want to appear weak.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.16
And you thought a manufactured war hero would give you credibility.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.17
Oh, wait.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.18
He got those purple hearts for minor injuries and then hung around with Jane Fonda after the war....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.19
OOOOOOOPS.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.20
We nominated him because we thought he had the best shot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.21
I live in America.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.22
A place with freedom of speech, and that freedom of speech has helped to secure your liberty.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.23
The only thing that secures my liberty is that there are big, burley men with guns ready to do violence on my behalf--- to paraphrase George Orwell.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.24
The ability of liberal morons to say stupid things is just an annoyance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.25
Bullshit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0318.26
Reality is over your head.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0319.25
I started my own thread for high points instead of beefs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0319.26
But it was royally hijacked.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0319.28
Hope it's a good game!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0320.15
Without a doubt my friend.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.3
False.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.4
They looked at the evidence that Bush allowed them to see.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.5
Oh, right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.6
Because clearly, none of these guys who had been around Washington longer than Bush had knew anyone over at the CIA or Pentagon.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.7
Because they hadn't been looking at the same intelligence in the 1990's that said the same things.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.8
So, because Bush withheld key intelligence that undermined his case for going to war with Iraq, Democrats should have just hit up 'Deep Throat"-like sources in underground parking lots to learn the truth?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.10
We weren't allies with those countries.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.11
Americans didn't want a second war.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.12
They thought the first one was a pretty dumb idea.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.13
Had the Japanese not bombed Pearl Harbor, we'd have let Hilter win and not really cared.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.14
We weren't allies with Britain and France????
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.15
I'm beginning to realize that I've given you much too much credit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.16
A dictator who wasn't a threat to us, hadn't caused us any problems, and who was actually co-operating with us at that point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.17
And all he had to do was let power go to some crazy Islamists who are already sizing everyone up for Burhkas...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.18
A dictator who killed hundreds of Americans by blowing up a plane over Scotland.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0325.19
As opposed to a dictator in Iraq who never launched any terrorist attacks against the U.S.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0326.21
So?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0326.22
Does that make those 5,000 deaths inconsequential?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.1
Well, no.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.2
I'm interested in facts, I've posted facts and the links to back them up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.3
You attempt to rebut them by imagining conversations and motives that suit your bias.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.4
In almost every post, you put words into people's mouths, and have them act out scenes based on your suspicions and dislikes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.5
That is not anything resembling a debate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.6
That's you in a fight with reality.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.7
Quoting Cecille:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.8
First, calm down, and read what I'm actually saying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.9
Newt spoke in speeches about his wife's cancer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.10
Both she and Newt say that she had cancer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.11
This is not something you need to debate, because it's been established that she had cancer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.12
She had surgery for uterine cancer, and then later went in to have a tumor removed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.13
The tumor removed in the second surgery was benign.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.14
That doesn't make her not have cancer earlier.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.15
She still had uterine cancer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.16
I'm not sure where the "verge of death" comment comes from, but it isn't from me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.17
Perhaps your let your imagination, or your anger, get the best of you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.18
Newt's wife said the divorce came as a surprise.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.19
Newt said that it didn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.20
We have both of them on the record making these statements.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.21
They do not agree.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.22
There's no point in you and I trying to figure out which of them is right, because they are the two people in the discussion, and they are not in agreement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.23
Newt has admitted that he cheated on both of his wives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.24
This is not up for debate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.25
He admits it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.26
Newt's second wife says that he dumped her a few months after she was diagnosed with MS.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.27
PBS is a reputable source.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.28
The other sources are reputable as well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.29
You can't spend your life ignoring inconvenient facts and expect to get anywhere.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.30
Take the car key out of your ear and listen to what I'M saying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.31
YOU say that he says these things.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.32
And then you cite ONLY quotes from him admitting to the one thing I've never argued.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.33
Furthermore, your sources for quotes are suspect, if not laughable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.34
So this basically amounts to YOUR WORD FOR IT, which I absolutely DO need to argue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.35
No, you do NOT get to state that something is so and tell me to just accept it and expect that to happen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.36
I pay every bit as much attention to your half-assed declarations of reality as I do to your piece-of-shit sources.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.37
PBS is a reputable source IN YOUR OPINION.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.38
That means nothing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.39
Your other sources are as reputable as a conversation overheard in a high school girls' bathroom.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.40
You can't spend your life declaring things to be facts with no substantiation and expect to get anything but laughed at.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.41
That's where we are now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.42
When you are ready to SHOW rather than TELL, come find me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.43
Until then, you no longer deserve even the marginal respect of having me read your posts, let alone respond.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.44
Begone.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.45
Who do you consider a reputable source?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.46
Give me five examples.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.47
This should be entertaining.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0327.51
Where did that crazy bitch run off to?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0328.1
I can't understand how anyone could be so lacking in common sense as to believe that Newt Gingrich could ever be elected president.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0328.2
I sense fear from your lash out rant.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0328.3
Obama, "the manchild", would lose big in a one on one debate with ol' Newtie.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0328.4
No contest.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0328.5
He can't hide his gaffes, his hypocrisy on issues, his scandals on fast and furious, cronie capitalism on solyndra/sunpower/and his failed Keynesian approach to our economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0328.6
That alinsky/cloward-piven crap is running out of time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0328.7
I think michele should make a trip to target and stock on crybaby blankets and kleenix.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0332.8
Is Newtie still in favor of Cap & Trade?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0332.10
I'd be in favor of capping you, and trading you in for someone with a brain.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.4
I would say everyone was wrong about Bin Laden.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.5
But Clinton had eight years to do something substanive about the guy, from when the first WTC attack happened, to the bombing of USS Cole.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.6
And he did nothing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.7
He let the guy walk out of the Sudan (after the Sudan had offered to turn him over) and into Afghanistan.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.8
Bush on the other hand, wiped out most of his network, toppled the two regimes that Clinton said was aiding him (Iraq and Afghanistan) froze his assets, captured or killed most of his key subordinates.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.9
To the point that all he had left at the end was a house and his porn stash where he lived cowering in fear.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.10
No.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.11
Everyone wasn't wrong about bin Laden.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.12
Clarke was right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.13
Bill Clinton was right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.14
George Bush was wrong before 9/11.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.15
The people you're citing who attacked Clarke were wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.16
They complained that Clarke kept coming in with his hair on fire---which means that he grasped the reality of the problem BEFORE 9/11.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.17
But in order to defend Bush, the right has been forced to attack Clarke for being overzealous...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.18
instead of having some degree of honesty and admitting that when Clarke's hair was on fire, Clarke was right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.19
Clinton was obsessed with bin Laden to the point that he was criticized for it.

Really?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.26
Doesn't that say something about you guys, then?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.27
You don't stand by your principles, you comprimise them because you want to win.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.28
Which is, of course, why you lost.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.29
Yes, it says that we are not rigid ideologues.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.30
As for 'why we lost', that's pretty funny.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.31
Look at the crop of candidates that the Pubs have this go round....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.32
please, don't compromise your principles.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.33
Nominate Newt, and let him go down in flames.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.35
Clarkes story changed depending upon the audience.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.36
That was clearly proven.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0333.37
Alright back to your rant.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.13
Actually, the only person who supported the "Clarke was a prophet" BS is clarke.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.14
A guy who we already caught lying when he said Condi Rice didn't know what Al Qaeda was when she talked about it during several interviews in 1999 and 2000.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.15
Therefore, nothing he said was believable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.16
You have a problem with attacking the person with hyperbole rather than with facts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.17
Thus, you feel you can dismiss Clarke by personally attacking him, dismiss Hill by claiming her students were bored, for example.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.18
That's an illogical way to approach what we're talking about.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.19
Clarke's story is backed up by the record.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.20
He asked for meetings on al Qaeda, repeatedly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.21
We know that no meeting occurred, in spite of his asking for months, until shortly before 9/11.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.22
We know that the people who dismissed Clarke as having his "hair on fire" were wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.23
We know that Clarke was right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.25
Condi was wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.26
Give the man credit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.27
Clinton did nothing about Bin Laden.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.28
Come to think of it, that was pretty much his whole presidency, he just talked and talked and talked.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.29
And took credit for the work of others.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.30
Kind of like the Affirmative Action President.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.31
You're denying the reality of the record with more personal attacks on the person we're discussing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.38
Why, Newt doesn't represent where most of the party is right now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.39
If we nominated a guy who was closest to where the rank and file is on the issues, we'd nominate Perry or Cain.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.40
Not that it matters, though.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.41
The Affirmative Action President is going down.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.42
So you're saying that you're not going to nominate Perry or Cain?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.43
As a prediction, I mean.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0334.44

Not to mention both presidents still pursued.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0338.4
The biggest difference is Obama sat on it for months afraid to pull the trigger.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0339.5
No, he absolutely didn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0339.6
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKHsjRzUTLQ">Obama in 2008: 'We Will Kill Bin Laden, We Will Crush Al Qaeda' - YouTube</a>
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0339.8
Proof is in the puddin'.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0340.1
Obama waited until the mission had the best chance of success.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0340.2
He was right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0340.3
Booyah!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0341.4
That's not completely true either.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0341.5
What he did was the build up a relationship with elements in the Pakistan ISI and military while rebuilding units that were completely devoted to taking out Bin Laden.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0341.6
This was a tricky and complicated set of operations that took a good amount of time to get to a point where it would have some level of achieving success.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0341.7
I am really quite surprised he gave the Bush administration any credit at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0341.8
But he did.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0342.9
Then isn't that waiting until there was the best chance of success?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0343.11
So, is Newtie still in favor of Cap & Trade?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0344.32
Liar.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0345.10
"Waiting" implies that there was an infrastructure already set up for the operation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0345.11
As in, all the dots were connected and Obama just simply had to wait on the "right time".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0345.12
That was not the case.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0346.5
Again, you're a liar.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886574_0346.6
Back up your bullshit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.1
I suspect they are awaiting instructions on how to counter facts with an alternative.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.2
Facts?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.3
"more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.4
- Newt Gingrich
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.5
More were added to food stamps under Bush than under Obama, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-01-18/fact-check-gingrich-obama-food-stamps/52645882/1">reports</a> Brooks Jackson: "Newt Gingrich claims that 'more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.6
' He's wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.7
More were added under Bush than under Obama, according to the most recent figures...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.8
Gingrich would have been correct to say the number now on food aid is historically high.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.9
The number stood at 46,224,722 persons as of October, the most recent month on record.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.10
And it's also true that the number has risen sharply since Obama took office.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.11
But Gingrich goes too far to say Obama has put more on the rolls than other presidents.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.12
We asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition service for month-by-month figures going back to January 2001.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.13
And they show that under President George W. Bush the number of recipients rose by nearly 14.7 million.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.14
Nothing before comes close to that."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.15
Of course, you wouldn't know a fact if it pushed your customer out of the way and bit you on the ass.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.17
Did you even read this?...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.18
what a spin..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.19
it's Bush's fault for the recipients added during his admin, but somehow not so for Obama because he inherited a mess?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.20
Not to mention in a mere 3 years, Obama has added only a few hundred thousand less than under Bush's 8?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.21
Priceless.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.23
By what criteria does anyone justify blaming a President for how many people were added to the food stamp rolls?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0033.24
Specifically.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.1
Reporting facts that Republicans may not like is liberal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.2
Doing things that Republicans may not like is Presidential.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.3
How dare the news report facts and...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.4
stuff!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.5
Liberals!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.6
Diversion...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.7
and not accurately addressing the real issue we have.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.8
Here is the issue..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.9
Obama was reported this way...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.10
Obama, showing America how he, too, is human, referred to the 57 satates today offering his overworked campaign staff reason to enjoy a much needed laugh.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.11
Perry was reported this way...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.12
Perry, again showed reason to question his knowledge of the three branches of government when he seemed to believe there are only 8 supreme court justices.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.13
His campaign staff is running around trying to put out the fires this has created for Perry's campaign.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.14
Enough said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.15
So you want the news to do an in depth fact finding mission to determine if Obama has been to 57 states and that would be fair since Newt said he never lobbied?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.16
Immature diversion from the point I was making.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0034.17
Guess you just didnt have anything better to respond with.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0035.1
Is the media in the bag for Newt?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0035.2
Murdoch is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0036.13
Just saying Diversion doesnt work anymore.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0037.2
You mean how to counter Newt hurt Feelings right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0037.3
Everytime hes asked something he clutches his pearls and says "well, I never"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0037.4
um...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0037.5
newt played this up because SC is a very right leaning state who already thinks the media is far left.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0037.6
Newt basically jerked over all their faces and the people wanted more of it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0037.7
You can see it in this thread as well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0037.8
In the end the story is this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0037.9
Newt played it up to the base, they loved it, but he still dodged the question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0037.10
You can't take one debate in a primary and use it for the rest of the race.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0037.11
If he were to win it would be a different ballgame, so his answer would have to be different.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0037.12
Or
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0037.13
He could answer it the same and risk loosing the middle more moderate Indies and GOP...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0037.14
Another one who decided to deabte something he knows nothing about.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0037.15
Obviously, you didnt watch the debate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0038.1
It's a bit more than that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0038.2
He gets a standing ovation evey time he bitch slaps them!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0038.3
He gets a standing O from an extreme wingnut crowd.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0038.4
Why shouldn't they let it be general admission, where Democrats and Independents could sit in the audience?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0038.5
curious...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0038.6
Do you see the audiences at a democratic debate as an audience of extreme wingnuts?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0038.7
Those would be 'moonbats'.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0038.8
And no, I don't see an exclusively Liberal audience at Democratic debates.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0038.9
Definitely Lefties, though!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0039.1
The media is biased in favor of a prolonged battle for the nomination because it's better for ratings.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0039.2
They will inevitably slant towards propping up the underdog and leaning on the favorite week by week day by day.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0054.13
i watched the clip of it, he didnt answer it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0054.14
he whined about the media and how disgusting it was for them to ask such a question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0054.15
nice try.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0054.16
Like i said its rather meaningless anyways.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0054.17
Newt is a hypocrite when it comes to marriage so his opinions on it are meaningless.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0054.18
Hey folks...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0054.19
HERE IT IS....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0054.20
PLASMABALL THINKS IT IS OK TO DEBATE SOMETHING BASED ON A SNIPPET...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0054.21
A CLIP OF WHAT HIS MEDIA DEEMED WAS WORTHY OF HIS KNOWING.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0054.22
I mean...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0054.23
you actually said he never answered the question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0054.24
That is completely false.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0054.25
he answered it completely.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0055.16
We do it all the time here...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0055.17
I watched the whole clip of him not really answering it, and giving King shit for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0055.18
If there was more, feel free to provide said evidence and we can go from thier.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0055.19
He didnt answer the question, he just blasted King and the media ( which was his answer).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0055.20
Im not sure where you are going with this and how you are reading my " he didnt answer the question".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0055.21
He answered it with a dodge.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0056.1
When?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0056.2
Where?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0056.3
You want to be the next one bitch-slapped by Newt - ?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0056.4
When he made his food stamp comment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0056.5
Are you retarded?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0056.6
Facts are sometimes difficult to accept aren't they?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0056.7
Yeah, when they are not factual.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0057.1
If the media is in the bag for Newt, then it is possible that CNN set up the question so Newt can answer in a forcible way.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0057.2
Forcible enough to send undecided republicans into his corner for the South Carolina primary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0057.3
I have called Newt a sabotuer for the Dem's, and the 'handling' of the debate by Newt appeared staged to me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0057.4
If the liberal media was against Newt, they would have taken into account how Newt performed against the moderator in past debates.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0057.5
The moderators normally would not ask the question right off the bat(which King has done) but knife Newt through his opponents like in previous debates so that Newt could not answer directly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0057.6
All Newt did was verbally body-slam a liberal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0057.7
That is how a Newt won S.C. In that case, Hannity should run for President!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0057.8
What makes you think John King is a Liberal?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0057.9
Or were you not thinking?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0057.10
Oh my fault.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0057.11
It is better to say that Newt verbally body-slammed CNN, a media outlet held to be liberally biased by many republicans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0057.13
Now is there a problem?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.3
My was not a diversion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.4
Mine was a response to something someone had said that was inaccurate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.5
No one is saying the media does not report the facts equally.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.6
they do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.7
But it is HOW they report them that makies it appear there is media bias.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.8
With the GOP candidates...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.9
we hear the media say "Rommeys critics feel he has something to hide in regard to his tax returns"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.10
With Obama....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.11
we heard...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.12
"It is not unusual for a candiate to not want to release his college transcripts...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.13
some do, some dont."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.14
Why didnt they say "Obamas critrics feel he may have something to hide regarding his college transcripts...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.15
afterall...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.16
it is true..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.17
his critics felt that
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.18
Oh SHIT!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.19
Well, shit, why didnt you present that evidence earlier.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.20
"Why didnt they say..."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.21
isnt proof of anything other than you thought up a question they didnt answer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.22
Why didnt they ask Bush what happened to the millions that was lost in Iraq?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.23
Bias or they didnt ask?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.24
Because I can think of questions they asked Obama and not Bush but what the fuck does that mean?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.25
Nothing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.26
hey..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.27
They intervvciewed Newts X right before a primary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.28
Did they interview any of Obamas former class mates?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.29
Did they interview any of Obamas parishoners at Wrights church?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.30
Did they interview anyne part of the Resko company?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.31
Heck...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.32
I got a question....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.33
who did they interview to dig up any dirt that may be out there about Obama?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0058.34
Who from his past did they intertview?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0059.20
Yo...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0059.21
he reacted to the question....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0059.22
and then he answered the question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0059.23
Yet the media that deemed it appropriate for the question to be asked did not feel the public warranted knowing his answer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0059.24
I willnot provide you a clip.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0059.25
I dont need to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0059.26
You want to assume you are correct....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0059.27
go for it....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0059.28
live in your ignorance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0059.29
I love it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0060.1
The media is on Romney's side....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0060.2
Newt stings them back.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0060.3
Actually, the media is on Obama's side.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0060.5
yes that is right -- which also compels them to favor Newt over romney.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0060.6
most Democrats in DC feel he will be one of the easiest opponents for obama to defeat in the general election.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0060.7
right or wrong they think of romney as more electable
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0061.3
Who would think that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0061.4
The guy wreakes of Conservatism...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0062.25
Ah cute spin.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0062.26
And lovely punt.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0062.27
You claimed he answered it, so it falls on you to provide proof.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0062.29
You won't, i win.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0063.33
Hey,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0063.34
They asked Obama about Bill Aires but never asked Bush about his relationship with the Bin Ladens...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0063.35
You know what that means...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0063.36
Yep, Media Bias.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0063.37
We can do this all day but at the end of it all, it's just you laying out bullshit to claim you are the victim of the liberal media, liberal education, liberal historians, liberal scientists, liberal brainwashers, liberal washing machines that wont get that stain out etc.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0063.38
It must be tough always being under attack...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0063.39
Thats when you let your conservadaddy hold you tight and tell you what a big bad world is out there and he'll protect you
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0064.22
ahh...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0064.23
Perhaps....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0064.24
from debate standpoint...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0064.25
sure...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0064.26
I wont produce the evinidence...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0064.27
so you win.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0064.28
Congratulations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0064.29
You won a debate with an anonymous poster on the internet.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0064.30
Yet you are please as punch that you have no idea that he answered the question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0064.31
An example of someone who prefers to be labelled a winner over knowing the truth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0065.33
I'm waiting for them to interview obama's drug dealer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0066.25
you did not answer my question....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0066.26
They interviewed Newts ex wife right before a primary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0066.27
They interviewed people that worked for companies once owned by Bain.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0066.28
Who from Obamas past did they interview?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0067.19
Exactlyu...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0067.20
he admittted to using drugs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0067.21
Do we know he did not have a bigger iussue?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0067.22
Who did they interview to find out?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0067.23
He admitted to having some marxists semtiments while in college...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0067.24
who did they interview to discuss his "enthusiasm" or "lack of it" from back then?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0067.25
But they interviewed an x wife who had already told her story to the press several years earlier...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0067.26
and then made that the first question of a debate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0068.21
Reverend Wright...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0068.22
any other assumptions?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0069.19
I'm STILL waiting for them to interview GWB's drug dealer and AA sponsors.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0070.19
Exactly GWB admitted to being a coke user...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0070.20
I'm sure youre all broken up about them not interviewing GWB drug dealer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0070.21
Or does you curiosity lose steam when you see the (R)?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0071.26
WOOOO I Rule, i won a debate on the internets....!!!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0071.27
Well my day is complete!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0071.28
Have a good day
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.1
Hey,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.14
See how that works?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.15
Exactly...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.16
Reverend Wright.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.17
Obama claimed to know nothing about his sentiments.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.18
Then he claimed he did but paid no mind.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.19
So one answer was a lie...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.20
so we know he, like all politicians, will lie for political expediency.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.21
So exactly who did they interview to find out the truth?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.22
You seem content with the truth....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.23
you know....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.24
"I didnt know of them....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.25
oh yeah...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.26
he was my mentor...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.27
so yes...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.28
I knew of them....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.29
but I never really paid attention..."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.30
And you were just fine with that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.31
And to you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0072.32
The media did a great job.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0073.20
FYI...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0073.21
a simple google search will give you dozens of links to his COMPLETE answer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0073.22
But, of course, you prefer only knowing what your media wants you to know....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0073.23
so you wont conduct that search.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0073.24
Live in ignorance.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0073.25
enjoy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0074.26
First you complain they didnt interview anyone from his past.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0074.27
Since you are wrong Now you are going back to the "they didnt ask the question I wanted them too sooo that means..."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0074.28
Moving those goalposts pretty fast there skippy
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0074.30
But in order to be a victim you have to see attacks from everywhere.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0075.27
READ...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0075.28
dont scan..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0075.29
Never said they did interview.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0075.30
Continually claimed they didnt...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0075.31
So tell me.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0075.32
show me who they interviewed.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0075.33
anyone?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0076.1
No way the "media" is bag for ANY republican.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0076.2
Whatever they do in the primaries for or against a republican is what they think will be best for the democrats.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0077.32
are you saying no one interviewed Rev Wright?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0078.1
However you spin it, Newt lied.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0078.2
When?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0078.7
I've found a new avie for you.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0079.1
ahh...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0079.21
what is google?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0080.1
Of COURSE the media is in the bag for Gingrich.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0080.2
They would LOVE to see him represent the GOP.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0080.3
Easy target, lots of baggage, a verbal gaffe just waiting to happen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0080.4
The only thing better than Gingrich would be Gingrich/Palin.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0080.5
Holy crap, they'd think they had died and gone to heaven.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0092.22
He answered the question, numbnuts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0092.23
The answer was her allegation was false.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0092.24
He offered evidence and the networks ignored it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0092.25
Or did you miss that part?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0092.26
It was a "when did you stop beating your wife" question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0092.27
He handled it very well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0093.7
You are aware that the Obama team are afraid of Newt getting the nomination aren't you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0093.8
In debates, Newt will kick Obama's pseudo-intellectual butt up one side of the stage and down the other.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0093.9
After all, all Obama has to run on is his dismal record and that alone has him pissing his pants.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0094.10
Still reheating that old food?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0094.11
I thought Obama was afraid of Trump, Pailin, Perry and Cain?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0094.12
What happened?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0095.22
Perry
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0096.13
Perry wasn't at the debate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0096.14
Or did you miss that too?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0097.5
Yes, they are, but they are wanting a Romney, Obama ticket, for the very reason that many conservatives despise Romney
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0097.6
I pay the media no mind when I am voting anyways.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0098.14
Sarah Palin is held to be a moron by many Democrats.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0098.15
Does that make it true?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0099.25
Rightwingers are Professional Victims.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0100.18
Leftwing nuts are perpetual liars
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0101.26
Uh...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0101.27
I don't think so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0102.10
perry
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0103.3
Right, because those corporate owned media outlets ALWAYS favor the party that doesn't favor them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0104.1
When?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0104.7

Until Romney gets the Nomination...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0105.4
Then the "Free Press" will make you Question Mormonism.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0105.7
peace...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0105.8
You need the press in order to question Mormonism?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0106.1
Hey,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0106.10
Victim cries Victim
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0107.13
Nope, never heard it and never said it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0107.14
Newt will kick ass in a debate with Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0108.6
But at least I'm smart enough not to stick my head up my ass like you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0108.7
What's your excuse?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0109.1
What I want to see is a presidential debate where obama brings up Gingrich's past affairs and Gingrich says "In both of your books you describe your cocaine addiction.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0109.2
How about you give us the name of your dealer and how much you bought."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0110.1
ROFLMAO...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0110.2
The media is in bed with Obama and any other Democrat.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0110.3
You're just being silly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0110.4
Yeah, just ask President Gore!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0111.3
I don't think Murdoch is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0111.4
He wants to win.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0112.1
why doesn't the op post the link where he got this hair brained idea from..?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0112.2
I read this from a article somewhere in the last couple days.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0112.3
can't remember where or I'd post it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0113.7
I think his goofy rhetoric just gets eyeballs pointing at some screen be it a TV, tablet, smartphone, etc...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0113.8
Better to quote him/opine on him and get the attention as a result than not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0113.9
At it's heart, I think the members of the media from all outlets are just as worried about how a Gingrich presidency would hold....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0113.10
kids scrubbing toilets, orphanages, etc...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0113.11
Its about as far away from the ideal of America as one can get.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0113.12
But when Obama suggested the same exact thing, it was labelled by the media and the left as a "wonderful" idea.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0113.13
Or did you forget abouyt Obama saying that all our younger generation should get involved at the community level....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0113.14
helping senior citizens, working in community centers, etc...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0113.15
Did you think he wanted them to do things like tax reporting and community planning...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0113.16
you know...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0113.17
things that require advanced educattions??
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0113.18
You can provide a quote he wanted kids to do janitorial duties?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0113.19
I can for Newt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0113.20
Your move.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0114.4
Not every thread is borne from some online story, bimbo.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0114.5
Some of us actually can think for ourselves.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0115.6
I hope you aren't including yourself in that "we", carpet puppet.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886578_0116.7
Well, I'm definitely not including you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.1
From the onset.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.2
It was clear he wasn't serious about being president.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.3
Serious meaning that he didn't take the time to prepare for the race.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.4
He was a little busy recovering from back surgery, geaux, and he went into the race too soon after surgery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.5
He simply wasn't himself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.6
Coaches make their athletes take off a year sometimes, depending on the surgery and the amount of time they can take a 16-year-old high school player to a 35-year-old professional ballhandler back on the field.

Campaigns are rigorous, and Perry is I think at least 50.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.8
I'm sure he had the best of care, but I think I've heard some surgery anesthetics become residual and might slow people down mentally and physically.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.9
He had to have the surgery, and it was at the worst time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.10
He's usually not one to get mixed up mid-sentence and has always been a good speaker.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.11
Even so, it will be good to have our governor Rick Perry back.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.12
The Perrys are real nice people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.14
Oh, so he was hopped up on Percocet?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.15
So he was, in fact, impaired while running for president?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.16
That's a convincing argument.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.17
I've yet to hear about this "residual/permanent" effects of anesthesia.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.18
I suffered through about one million pre-op consents and have yet to hear that listed as a possible adverse event.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.19
Though, I'd be happy to look at any material you have.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.20
Are we going to blame anesthesia for Perry knowing jack and shit about foreign policy too?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0044.21
You guys can have him back.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0045.1
I won't even mention that The Rabbi & Missourian were his early cheerleaders before Perry even opened his mouth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0045.2
When Perry's name first came up as a possible candidate my thoughts were "ANOTHER Texan after "W"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0045.3
You got to be kiddin me lol
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.1
Today, Rick Perry dropped out, and I had to dig down five pages on USMB to find a thread on it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.2
Not even a gloating thread by CandyCorn.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.3
I'm so disappointed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.4
Ahh, so sad, really.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.5
I had high hopes that Perry would be the guy who could bridge the divide between the TEA Party and the GOP establishment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.6
But it never came to pass.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.7
First, the Establishment has it's heart set on Romney.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.8
If they have to lie, cheat, steal or do whatever, that's what they'll do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.9
And they'll blame us when Romney loses.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.10
But Perry made mistakes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.11
Much like Fred Thompson four years ago, you simply can't do these things on the fly. You have to build an organization, you have to get used to stumping, you have to get supporters lined up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.12
You have to participate in the early debates with the fringe characters to find your voice and your little corner to base yourself in.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.13
I think that there will be people who will declare the TEA Party dead.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.14
I don't think so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.15
The thing is, the TEA Movement hasn't really been around long enough to establish solid leaders.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.16
It took 16 years between Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan for the modern conservative movement to take hold.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.17
After Romney loses, Perry might well be able to take another shot at it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.18
But he should take his time and spend more time introducing himself to the American public.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.19
1 · 2 · Uhmmm.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0046.20
Ron Paul, some help please.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0047.1
He stumbled badly in the first debate and never recovered.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0047.2
It takes a lot more than slogans and platitudes to win over conservative s. They are smart and they research issues, they want substantive answers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0047.3
Perry couldn't answer the questions in depth and it showed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0047.4
If Perry was a Democrat, he'd be their candidate - liberals will buy anything....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0047.5
Hope and Change anyone?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0048.1
I believe several things hurt Rick Perry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0048.2
He did have surgery, and the effects of anaesthesia can last a long time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0048.3
Perry entered the race too late, he also just for whatever reason was not himself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0048.4
Unfortunately for Rick Perry, by the time he started doing really good in the debates, it was too late.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0048.5
If Rick Perry had started the debates they way he did his last two debates, he would most likely have the nomination locked up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0048.6
It is sad that Perry started off as bad as he did, he was the only candidate that stood up for and defended the Marines who pissed on the bodies of the Taliban.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0048.7
I am going to support the United States Marine corps and disagree with Mr. Perry and you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0049.2
It takes a lot more than slogans and platitudes to win over conservatives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0049.3
They are smart and they research issues, they want substantive answers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0049.7
Okay then...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0049.8
as a conservative you should be able to tell us what Mitt's plans for the military are then, right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0049.9
I don't mean where he's going to send them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0049.10
I mean, is he going to increase the size, decrease the size, close bases in Europe, Korea, Iraq, etc....?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0049.11
Surely as a "smart" conservative, you've "researched" the issue and he's provided substantive answers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0049.12
Total agreement about Perry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0049.13
He has never run in a race where the result wasn't a foregone conclusion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0049.14
It showed on the National Stage and such non-vetting of candidates by Texas has shown in their state's dismal performance compared to other states.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0049.15
Read his book sweetheart, it's all there - with pictures too!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886628_0049.16
Unfortunately he doesn't have anything as catchy as "hope and change" to hold your interest.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.1
So you like Obama think shipping 1 million barrels a day by the sea in a tanker · (equal to 700,000 barrels in pipeline) IS SAFER then a pipeline buried underground with monitors every xx mile and shut off valves that will limit to at most 300 barrels in one mile is SAFER???
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.2
WHAT is your conception of oil tankers versus pipelines?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.3
WHICH would create MORE environmental damage?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.4
THE TANKER!!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.5
THE PIPELINE creates LESS damage PLUS YOU idiot..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.6
WHERE do you think Canada will sell that oil then???
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.7
CHINA which will require the shipping by TANKER each DAY!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.8
FACTS are so hard to deal with!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.9
First Obama isn't shipping anything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.10
It would be Canada doing the shipping.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.11
And it's not really crude oil.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.12
The stuff is so thick that they need to dilute it to ship it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.13
Event still if they plan to ship it anywhere there is quite a bit of opposition.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.14

FIRST IT doesn't make a difference IF OBAMA/Canada who shitting cares?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.16
IT IS 1 million barrels of oil thick,etc. worse then!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.17
Simply put WHICH IS A BIGGER NUMBER???
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.18
1 million barrels by Tanker prone to human errors, Acts of GOD?????
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.19
OR · 300 barrels which is what one mile of 2,147 miles holds!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.20
WHICH IS THE BIGGER NUMBER??
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.21
DUH..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.22
wouldn't you think no you aren't thinking..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.23
the larger number transported by the riskier mechanism would have a greater affect then a smaller number shipped underground???
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.24
HOW f..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.25
,ing stupid!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.26
What are people like you thinking?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.27
I am asking a very fundamental question here..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.28
WHICH IS BIGGER 1 million barrels or 300 barrels???
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.29
CAN YOU figure that out???
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.30
There are signifcant challenges to Canada shipping via tanker to China.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.31
More so than getting this pipeline extended to the gulf coast refineries.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.32
That's what I'm thinking, not if 1,000,000 is bigger than 300.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.33
I'd be all for it if it was to reduce our dependence on foriegn oil.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.34
It doesn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.35
Hell, I'd be for it if it signficantly reduced the price of gas here in the US.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0021.36
It will not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0022.29
Actually, we could stop importing oil from the ME and drilling domestically would ensure this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0022.30
I believe we import something like 20 percent of total from the ME.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0022.31
I'd love to tell Saudi, Iran and every other camel hole to suck it but as long as we have political footballs to launch then we're gonna be involved in endless wars.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0023.15

even though gas prices are headed to $5/gal....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0024.1

I thought you were against the pipeline because of the fact there might be at worst case 300 barrels leaking over one mile worst case..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0059.35
RIGHT?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0059.36
The pristine prairieland already crisscrossed (unless you are unaware??)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0059.37
by 25,000 miles of pipeline would be at the worst case environmentally affected by 300 barrels.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0059.38
SO why are you in favor of Canada selling and then having to ship 1 million barrels a day over the ocean PER DAY?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0059.39
Because that is the choice!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0059.40
Do you want 1 million barrels in flimsy tankers tossed on gigantic waves breaking up and spilling 1 million barrels into 20,000 square miles?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0059.41
WHY are you in favor of that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0059.42
I thought you were environmentally sensitive!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0059.43

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0059.46
1 million barrels in a ship or 300 barrels in 1 mile of pipe?

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.2
This pipeline is something WE need now..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.3
not only for the energy that would come from a friendly neighbor, but FOR JOBS..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.4
remember those things Obama and the Democrats say they were focused on..?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.5
I'm totally disgusted with this President..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.6
Didn't say much about renewable energy, did I?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.7
I was talking about our 1940's technology electrical grid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.8
I'd bet more PERMANENT JOBS would be created in the upgrade and maintenance of a smart grid than the pipeline.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.9
You see, I think the problem is that "big energy" doesn't want the smart grid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.10
Because they charge us for their inefficiency....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.11
at a profit....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.12
yes, they even profit on the inefficiencies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.13
If we went to a more efficient transmission of our electricity, they wouldn't be able to gouge us as much.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.14
Did you ever think that the reason we've been working on renewable energy for so long is that the energy lobby really doesn't want it to happen?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.15
Look, I'm not all that much of a tree hugger....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.16
but you have to think beyond the "political" box.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.17
I know it's easy to blame gubmint for everything...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.18
but there are other forces out there that manipulate too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.19
That's why I question the Conservative mantra of "Critical Thinking".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.20
The only thing that Conservatives Apply those skills to is government, and more specifically...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.21
Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.22
The huge point that you are missing is that Keystone will be paid for with other people's money not our tax dollars.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.23
While upgrading the grid is needed we just don't have the money and we certainly don't need to be billions more in debt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.24
Keystone will cost us nothing and it will generate tax revenue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.25
Even if what you say is true...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.26
which I doubt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.27
I don't doubt you believe it, I just doubt that it's so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.28
Anyway...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.29
look at the number...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.30
60%....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.31
that's the amount of WASTE in our electrical grid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.32
That 60%(and the other 40%) is what we as consumers, businesses and government gets charged for in our electric bills.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.33
Not to mention all the coal and oil that gets wasted in the production of electricity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.34
It's virtually impossible not to have ANY loss.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.35
But European Countries have narrowed it down to only a 20% loss and Japan has pushed the envelope to 10%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.36
We can't even do 50/50 in our current grid system.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0091.37
It's not that we can't afford it, it's that we can't afford NOT to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8886943_0092.22

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0048.6
The people whom he led in the past don't want him now, and his temperament is not suited to the Presidency.

Sorry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0048.8
Given those people were a large part of the problem, and couldn't wait to get back to making deals with the other side, not seeing their objections as being the problem.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0048.9
I look at the results- Balanced budgets (kind of), welfare reform and serious changes in the way Congress did business.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0048.10
But, heck, no, we don't want any real reform.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0048.11
We want a guy who is going to cut more deals with the special interests, because that's worked so well for the country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0048.12
Sure, I like Gingrich.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0048.13
He's a very smart man.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0048.14
He did some good things in office so we have to give credit where credit is due.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0048.15

I wish Paul was a little bit more articulate and less frenetic in his responses.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0055.2
I think Newt has been the most accurate and forthright.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0055.3
He has been married 3 times, currently for 13 years to Calista, and I respect the fact that, in spite of political consequences, he has been divorced 2 times, rather than having a sting of lovers, while married to one woman, as so many other politicians try to get away with.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0055.4
I like Newt because I trust Newt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0055.5
He is the least PC of them all, thus far, and in my opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0055.6
Justin Quinn: "Gingrich has been married three times, and he has been accused of having a multitude of extramarital affairs, although he has only admitted to one -- with the woman who would eventually become his third and present wife."

Newt has been neither forthright or accurate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0055.11
The constant stream of Pinocchios he has gotten from the Washington Post, on easily checked facts, demonstrates this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0055.12
Not that it will matter to the wingnuts who rely more on truthiness than truth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.1
Newt Gingrich is a stupid person's idea of what a smart person sounds like.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.2
I think it was Paul Krugman who said that, and I like it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.3
Gingrich is also a pathological liar.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.4
He lied about his role with Freddie Mac and every time he is caught in a lie, he tells another one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.5
And he took an active part in destroying the economy by helping the GSEs defend themselves when some members of Congress were trying to unwind them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.6
He's a gigantic hypocrite as well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.7
While he was excoriating Bill Clinton for cheating on Hillary, and made it a special point to say he was going to bring up Monica Lewinsky every chance he got, he himself was cheating on his own wife.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.8
On top of all that, he is corrupt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.9
He was the first Speaker of the House in history to be fined.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.10
He was caught lying to Congress.

Those of us who believe in free markets and those of us who believe that, in fact, the whole goals of investment is entrepreneurship and job creation, would find it pretty hard to justify rich people figuring out clever, legal ways to loot out a company, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich told reporters in Manchester, New Hampshire, yesterday, ahead of the states Jan. 10 presidential primary.

Mitt Romney is not a capitalist, Tyler said.

He is a predatory corporate mugger.

If you ever wonder why so many manufacturing jobs are overseas, you need to look no further than Mitt Romney.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.18
He can claim thousands of jobs created, only those jobs were created in Mexico and Southeast Asia.

Neocons have been mistaking the elephant's shit for the elephant.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.20
It is time to sweep Newt into the dustbin.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.21
You're getting your position on other people's intelligence from Paul Krugman.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.22
'Nuff said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.23
He's only a Nobel Prize winner.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0056.24
Why do wingnuts hate intelligence?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0057.13
And, managed to lower the bar, so far, even Mitt Romney.....

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0058.20
Please show the intelligence prerequisite for the Nobel Peace Prize
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0059.11
Did Manifold say Obama was wiping the field with the Republicans in the debates?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0059.12
Um...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0059.13
does he know that Obama isn't debating the Republicans?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0060.2
Krugman got the Nobel prize for economics, not peace.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0060.3
However, he's still an idiot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0060.4
Put him in a room with any halfway intelligent free market economist and he turns into a blubbering moron.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0060.5
I've seen some debates where Krugman's opponent had him practically in tears.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0061.6
Sit him down with Walter Williams.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0061.7
It would be priceless.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0062.7
I think such an encounter actually occurred.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0062.8
However, I'm not certain of it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0063.1
Krugman laments in his Nov. 3 New York Times column "Oligarchy, American Style," "We have a society in which money is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few people, and in which that concentration of income and wealth threatens to make us a democracy in name only."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0063.2
I'd ask Krugman this question: Who's putting all the money in the hands of the few, and what do you think ought to be done to stop millions, perhaps billions, of people from using their money in ways that lead to high income and wealth concentration?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0063.3
In other words, I'd like Krugman to tell us what should be done to stop the millions of children who make Joanne Rowling rich, the millions who fork over their money to the benefit of LeBron James, and the hundreds of millions of people who shop at Wal-Mart.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0063.4
I'd like to end this discussion with a bit of a personal note.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0063.5
The readers of this column know that I never make charges of racism.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0063.6
Rowling is an author, and so am I. In my opinion, my recently published book "Race and Economics: How Much Can Be Blamed on Discrimination?"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0063.7
is far more important to society than any "Harry Potter" novel.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0063.8
I'd like to know what it is about me that explains why millions upon millions have not purchased my book and made me a billionaire author.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0063.9
Maybe Krugman and the Wall Street occupiers have the answer.

Another dope who doesn't believe in facts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0065.14
I don't think he said that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0065.15
More likely, he said that the winner of these GOP debates is Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0065.16
Because he is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0066.6
No you haven't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0067.3

No wonder you wingnuts like him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.4
It's all deflection and misdirection.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.5
This is an economist who doesn't know about monopolies, cartels and collusion?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.6
Nobody has included LeBron as among 'the few'.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.7
More like the NBA owners, who have a monopoly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.8
Or like oil companies, who have a cartel.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.9
As does cable TV, who have both.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.10
Everything you know about monopolies, cartels and collusion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.11
There has never been a monopoly in this country that wasn't government enforced.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.12
Cartels always fall apart.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.13
The NBA is a classic example of a government enforced monopoly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.14
OPEC has never been able to enforce any of its quotas on production or prices.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.15
Cable monopolies are all government enforced.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.16
All you did is demonstrate your complete ignorance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.17
No wonder you're a Krugman fan.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.18
You left out oil companies, Braniac.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.19
There are a few who control the entire market.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0077.20
Are you saying that if a government doesn't break up a monopoly (cable), it is enforcing the monopoly?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0078.8
I nominate Gingrich at captain of the USA Debate Team for the 2013 International Debate Olympics.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0079.8
Always knew Newt could tear it up in a debate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0080.19
I mentioned OPEC, dipstick.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0080.20
I'll repeat, despite having no legal hindrances, OPEC has been unable to enforce any of its production quotas or price limits.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0080.22
Government created the cable monopoly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0080.23
Virtually every city in the country grants a monopoly to one cable company or another.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0080.24
that is, they legally exclude any other company from providing services in the area.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0080.25
Every true monopoly that has ever existed has been government enforced.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0081.18
OPEC aren't oil companies, Braniac.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0081.19
I'm talking Exxon, Shell, BP...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0082.12
OPEC is a cartel of oil producers, and it fails to have the control you claim it should have.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0082.13
You think the companies you listed have a monopoly, seriously?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0082.14
Since you can mention more than one, they obviously don't have a monopoly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0082.15
Furthermore, oil is traded on the world market, so it's nonsensical to talk about American companies having "control" of the market.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0082.16
Furthermore, there are at least 20 American oil companies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0082.17
That hardly paints a picture of a limited number of competitors.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0082.18
Any way you look at it, you're wrong.

Ron Pauls crotchety meter was turned to 11, with the scrappy Texan refusing to give an inch no matter how hard the moderators tried to shame him or put words in his mouth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0084.5
Clearly you dont understand my position, he pushed back when pestered about his position on military spending.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0084.6
Even when the crowd turned loud and nasty on certain foreign-policy points, Paul refused to soft-pedal his anti-interventionism.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0084.7
Neither would he pretend to feel bad about roughing up the competition.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0084.8
Arguably the best moment of the night: asked if he felt bad about his recent assault on Rick Santorum, Paul declared that his only regret was that he couldnt fit more slaps into his adsthen proceeded to tick off additional parts of Santorums record that he finds objectionable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0084.9
Take that, you hand-wringing, comity-obsessed wusses!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887219_0085.9
That would be like putting Krugman's brain in a Cuisinart.

America knows who wrecked the economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.4
That Republicans hid the cost of the wars from the country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.5
That the bulk of the deficit comes from the Bush tax cuts, the "drugs for votes" bill and the unnecessary war.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.6
Bush and the Republicans held both houses and the presidency for six straight years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.7
They have nothing to be proud of during that entire time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.8
In fact, they even let Bin Laden go.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.9
You can't run on, "We have to get Obama out of office because he (and then name Republican failure)".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.10
This isn't the "Reagan Legacy Project".

People remember who did what.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.12
There is a strategy called, "Just that one fact alone".

Obama helped extend unemployment for suffering Americans, just that one fact alone....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.18
Republicans can't use that strategy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.19
It would backfire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.20
There were no WMD's.

Really, really whacko.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.38
Get a clue -it is hard to insist the fault even YEARS later lies with the out of power party honey.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.39
Maybe that bullshit still sells in nutjob land but not among normal people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.40
I'm not even going to address the stupid idiotic crap you wrote -there is no point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.41
I'm still trying to grasp the mentality that will not only say but BELIEVE it when they say even when Democrats have super majorities and total control of two branches of government meaning they have no brakes at all, had no reason to compromise with Republicans over anything and didn't and even years later -they still aren't responsible for a FUCKING THING.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.42
NOT EVER.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.43
Oh sure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.44
And apparently this really works for some which speaks volumes about who are their natural constituents and base.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.45
Sorry -I'm truly just not stupid enough to be a Democrat.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0021.46

Obamacare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0023.2
Just that one fact alone will be used against Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0023.3
Also, Obama said he should be held accountable if he did not get the economy going.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0023.4
Well, unemployment is still in the crapper, and if it still is in November, that one fact alone will sink him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0023.5
Yea, because health care for Americans is so bad.

Ron Pauls Campaign Manager Died of Pneumonia, Penniless and Uninsured
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0023.7
And so, what started in February 2007 with one laptop in Snyder's Arlington, Va., apartment, quickly grew into a $35 million campaign employing 250 people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0023.8
In the fourth quarter of that year, Snyder raised a stunning $19.5 million for Paul  more than any other Republican candidate had raised at the time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0023.9
*The Kansas City Star quoted his sister at the time as saying that a "a pre-existing condition made the premiums too expensive."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0023.10
Despite Pauls insistence that charity is the appropriate response to Americas uninsured crisis, Snyders friends raised $34,870.53, far short of the $400,000 necessary to pay his bills.

The tax payer should foot the bill.

Wow, how "FREE!"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0023.16
I want to see Republicans run on this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0024.2
What fiascoes are you talking about?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0024.3
Make sure you can prove it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0024.4
Don't just lie.

Says the OP that piled shit high enough to defy gravity
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887442_0026.1
Obama has even assigned his failures to "bad luck".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.1
I am so shocked that republicans can treat one of there own in such a way as they have regarding mitt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.2
i am a registered democrat.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.3
i intend to vote for mitt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.4
I like obama but am not sure he can get things done.

i know that this is an issue for alot of americans but can not understand why?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.7
why should it matter?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.8
this is why we live in a free country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.9
mitt is the only candidate who can win.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.10
stop all the negative ads (Newt) you are just giving amunition to obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.11
I am sure he is just relaxing and lauphing while all of you are fighting.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.12
get over it and think about what is at stake.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.13
grow up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.14

mitt will not try to convert all of you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.18
he just wants what is best for the country.

Good tell all your friends to vote for him too.

Bashing Romney does not have anything to do with his religion for most.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.23
This is a primary, primaries get ugly, and itll make the candidate stronger in the end if its Mitt most Republicans will support him
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.24
Exactly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.25
If I were Mitt I'd be embarrassed by McCain and Sununu out there calling Newt a big meany.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0006.26
Makes Mitt look like a cupcake.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0007.1
I'm a Romney supporter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0007.2
I don't think Newt has earned back any of his lost support with his attacks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0007.3
I think if his ads make people back away from Romney their votes will go to Santorum or Paul or maybe Huntsman, not Newt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0007.4
But for the most part I think it's good that Romney is taking the heat now...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0007.5
so there are no surprises later and because I think it will prepare him for the showdown with Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0008.1
i agree with you but can't understand why Newt is such a cry baby.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0008.2
he is the one who wants to dish it out but can't take it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0008.3
Oh and being a conservative ?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0008.4
Throws Clinton under the bus while having an affair.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0008.5
that just shows him to lack character when this is what we need most.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0008.6
Romney threw down the gauntlet.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0008.7
I'm not watching Newt cry. I'm watching Newt give Romney back a knuckle sandwich.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0008.8
Mitt went heavy negative first.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0008.9
It's game on now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0008.10
And Newt by the way had to pursue Clinton for purgery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0008.11
It had nothing to do with an affair.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0008.12
And actually, Newt defended Clinton's bombings in retaliation for the attacks on the embassies when everyone else was running around saying President Clinton was just trying to deflect from having to testify.

Tens of Millions Spent to Target Newt Gingrich
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0009.7
By Gary Cohen
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0009.8
of the Iowa caucuses, well-funded so-called super PACs are using the political clout given to them by the nation's highest court in an unprecedented tour de financial force.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0009.9
Data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics indicates 264 super PACs have raised more than $32 million and spent almost $16 million in the 2012 election cycle thus far, The Hill reports.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0009.10
The lion's share of the money those groups have spent has targeted former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, according to The Hill.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0009.11
The impact in Iowa is clear: Iowa voters are being reminded repeatedly about Gingrich's ties to Freddie Mac, his divorces, and his lengthy Capitol Hill career.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0009.12
"This is politics" former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said last week when he reacted to calls for him to condemn attack ads run by the group Restore Our Future.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0009.13
The Huffington Post points out that those were part of a $3.3 million negative ad campaign waged by the group against Gingrich.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0009.14
Candidates with enough financial clout are able to lay their own groundwork to mobilize voters and remain positive while the super PACS continue to run negative ads, the Huffington Post reports.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0009.15
Campaign finance observers have been concerned that empowered by the January 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing independent groups to raise and spend unlimited money, such groups would change the balance of campaigns dramatically.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0009.16
In the past the political battlefield has been overseen by political party organizations and candidate committees.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887597_0009.17
According to a Huffington Post analysis of independent expenditures thus far this election cycle, super PACs have combined to spend $11 million in the Republican primaries, including at least $5.8 million in Iowa alone.

Serious question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0014.2
Do you ever actually work?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0014.3
Lol, fair question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0014.4
Short answer, yes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0014.5
I meet with my clients initially to discuss their needs and desires.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0014.6
Usually that takes several hours.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0014.7
Then if hired I accompany them to speciality showrooms to pick products.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0014.8
Then after the products are chosen a design and layout is drawn up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0014.9
This can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days depending on the degree of difficulty.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0014.10
Once physical work begins I help with deconstruction to ensure damage is not done to things that aren't being changed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0014.11
I personally do all the framing for any new construction.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0014.12
I do all the cabinetry and plumbing and most of the electric.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0014.13
BUT, the actual stone and finish work I do not do much of anymore.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0014.14

I love my job.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0014.21

Unless business is so slow that its eating into my savings in a major way I work my help first.

you are showing how naive you are as it pertains to what Bain Capital does.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0015.4
They seek out failing businesses and do their best to turn them around.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887658_0015.5
Under Romeny's watch, they achevied a success rate of 70%...

The poor Obama/OWS supporters,they must be so damn confused on what their Talking-Points should be.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0065.2
Some come here everyday boasting about how well Wall Street is doing,not realizing they're supposed to hate Wall Street.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0065.3
Clearly their Talking-Point signals have been severely crossed up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0065.4
Do they love Wall Street?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0065.5
Do they hate Wall Street?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0065.6
Who knows?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0065.7
They don't even know.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0065.8
I guess all that HuffPoop and MSLSD stuff isn't helping them much.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0065.9
Stick around a bit longer and you're sure to see an Obama/OWS supporter here crowing about how great Wall Street is doing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0065.10
It's pretty bizarre but very funny too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0065.11
Boasting about it as Obama demonizes them on one hand and garners campaign funds from them all in the same breath...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0065.12
Astounding.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0065.13
The sheep are confused by the actions of thier herders.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0066.14
Yeah,there are a few rabid loyal Obama/OWS supporters who routinely come here crowing about how well Wall Street is doing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0066.15
It's hilarious everytime i see them doing that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0066.16
They don't have a clue as to what their Talking-Points should be anymore.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0066.17
Should they love Wall Street?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0066.18
Should they hate Wall Street?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0066.19
They're just so confused.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0066.20
I guess they see Wall Street doing well as somehow a benefit to their guy in the White House.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0066.21
So they they're torn between cheerleading for Wall Street and hating Wall Street.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0066.22
They just don't know which Talking-Point to embrace.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0066.23
Stick around awhile longer and i'm sure you'll see a couple of them expressing this confusion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0066.24
It's some fun entertainment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0067.25
Indeed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0067.26
You try to educate them and it is roundly rejected.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0067.27
So why not laugh at thier foibles as a consolation prize?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0068.1
the OWS mission was the change the narrative from deficits to income inequity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0068.2
In that sense OWS was successful.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0068.3
Actually, it changed the narrative from deficits to "hey, look at those trustafarians camping out in the middle of the city, smoking dope, raping each other and shitting all over the place," then it went back to deficits.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0068.4
But at least those brats think they had their own little Woodstock moment, which counts for something, I suppose.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0069.5
BOOYAH!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0070.1
OWS changed the discussion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0070.2
That alone is a major victory.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0070.3
If the Dems follow up, and use the real inequities that exist in our system, present remedies for those inequities, we may see some real progress this election.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0070.4
You do know, don't you, that your saintlike Dems are perpetuating and profiting from those inequities?

They don't give a shit about you, Roxy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0070.6
But you just keep blindly pulling that D lever.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0070.7
No shit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0070.8
Voting for the people that are taking advantage...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0070.9
stuffin' thier pockets...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0070.10
and 'the other guys' are responsible.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0070.11
The sheep are indeed bleating...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8887769_0070.12
Useful idiots are useful.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.1
It is slowly recovering on its own despite Obamas policies and business crunching regulations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.2
I am very glad it is coming around but I just wish we could vote Obama out now to expedite the process.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.3
My prediction is that if Obama loses the election growth will double the current snails pace its growing at.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.4
In fact I bet upon the news alone that he loses the election we will start seeing firms hire and invest exponentially.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.8
the number of layoffs nationwide caused by government regulation is minuscule and shows no evidence of getting worse during the Obama administration.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.9
Lack of demand for business products and services is vastly more important.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.10
Nice quote and all...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.11
But the concern was that regulations would curtail the hiring BACK of people already laid off....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.12
not result in further lay offs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.13
Companies had trimmed themselves down to the bare miunimum....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.14
no one was really looking at additional layoffs....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.15
with the exception of companies going out of business.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.16
You quoted an article that does not at ALL address the issue of regulations costing employers money that they may otherwise invest back into the company so they can bring it back tot he size it was before the recession.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.17
The quote doesn't, but the article itself does.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.18
It shows that it is a myth that regulations curtail job growth at any signficant level.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0007.19
This is according to a CONSERVATIVE economist and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0008.3
So sueing companies like Boeing because they want to build in a state his "friends" don't control is not hurting job growth?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0008.4
Or regulating farm dust or putting light bulb companies out of business or stopping oil drilling for so long all the platforms went to other countries instead of waiting or any other numerous stupid decision he has made.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0008.5
The point is, any economic growth that Obama is inhibiting is miniscule in comparison to other factors.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0008.6
Rather than blaming politicians, we need to blame the state of the market.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0008.7
Maybe but he has had a hand in the demise of tens of thousands of jobs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0008.8
Minuscule as that may be, explain that to those who have lost out because of him or his administration.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0009.7
Let me ask you this question....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0009.8
If you were about to open a lemon aid stand...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0009.9
and your business plan allowed for an 8% NET profit by the end of your 3rd year...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0009.10
but a large personal investment to start.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0009.11
But there was word coming from Washington that the EPA, with the Presidents blessing, was going to pass new regulations on the purchasing and use of lemons....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0009.12
nothing concrete....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0009.13
nothing for sure....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0009.14
just word going around....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0009.15
Would you dive into the venture...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0009.16
or wait until you knew what the EPA was going to do?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0010.7
He also had a hand in creating close to 3 million jobs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0011.13
any given regulation...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0011.14
perhaps not..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0011.15
But knowing that there is a large influx of regulations...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0011.16
and many more to come?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0011.17
It is that "concern for the unknown" that stymies economic growth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0011.18
Knowiung what the regulation is allows one to compensate..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0011.19
and move forward.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0011.20
Not knowing what is to come and how much it will cost?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0011.21
That si what we are referring to..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0011.22
And we have a regulation happy administration right now...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0011.23
that you cant deny.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0012.6
Nonsense.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0012.7
He has invested in mostly failed enterprises.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0012.8
There are fewer jobs available now than there were before he took office.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0012.9
He may have helped "a specific" segment, mostly govt or unions but that's it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0013.5
What regulations would those be?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0013.6
I just gave all my employees a 10% raise and am looking seriously at renting another warehouse.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0014.22
If you read the article, it also says that Republicans try to perpetuate the myth about the uncertainty businesses face due to regulations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0015.6
he took my money and gave it to joe so joe can hire tom to do work that gary and his employee Zach would have done but wasnt allowed to do becuase Obama said he wanted Joe to do it with his new employee Tom.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0015.7
So Gary and Zach lost their jobs and Tom got a job.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0015.8
Thus why Obama "created" millions of jobs....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0015.9
but there are 1.8 million less people working now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0015.10
Are you not aware of how that happened?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0016.7
oo can i come work for you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0017.16
It is not a myth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0017.17
It is real.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0017.18
It is basic business logic.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0017.19
You do not make business moves if you can not accurately forecast.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0017.20
Sort of business planning 101.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0018.1
This is what the democrats did to jobs since they took office in January 2007.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0018.2
There is no jobs recovery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0018.3
Just workers falling of the unemployment rolls.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0018.4
No jobs have been created.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0018.5
Just job loss as far as the eye can see.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0019.9
Umm, okay, so why didn't Tom get the job if Joe wanted him?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0019.10
I do not understand what would be stopping him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0020.18
It affects small businesses, sure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0021.8
Untrue, he created 2.5 million private sector jobs under the stimulus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.7
OK...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.8
then you can relate....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.9
One of my clients was hit with a new local ordnance regarding loading bay width.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.10
Apprarently, some worker at some other company did not follow loading bay rules and tried to walk around the far side of a truck that had little clearance from the wall to the side mirror....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.11
he nerly took his entire nose off....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.12
for the truck mirror was damaged and sharp.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.13
So the local legislator pushed for a new regulation adding 6 inches to the width of a loading bay.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.14
and it was instituted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.15
My client had 12 months to comply wioth the new regulation.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.16
and as you know.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.17
it is pretty expensive to have to widen a loading bay.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.18
He did it at a cost of over 75K.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.19
during a year where his profits barely allowed him his basic s-corp salary of 1K per week...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.20
and NO distributions...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.21
so he was forced toactually spend an extra 75K in a year where he took home only 52K...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0022.22
Ya think he wanted to hire new people?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0023.1
The thing people forget, American workers even without unions will never work for what someone in Indonesia will work for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0023.3
The one thing we need to do, is not cater to corporations who make their product overseas.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0023.4
You want factory jobs back, that is the only way that will happen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0024.8
That's where most jobs originate unless your flipping burgers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0041.1
you need to be a business owner to understand intitiatives and what is fluff and what is otherwise.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0041.2
What so if a business needs to borrow, they just should fail, huh?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0041.3
if it needs to borrow to stay afloat...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0041.4
yes...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0041.5
it should fail for its business model is flawed or it would have the capital to stay afloat when times are lean.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0041.6
It simply means it will ultimately fail with even MORE debt if it borrows to stay afloat · If it needs to borrow to expand....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0041.7
then yes...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0041.8
it should borrow.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0041.9
I was against the GM bailout.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0041.10
It was unfair to Ford who had a soloid business model.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0041.11
GM blew it and it was rewarded.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0041.12
Okay, so what should Obama have done for small businesses, in your opinion?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0042.12
Day one he should have told them thatthe Bush Tax Cuts woulkd be extended to all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0042.13
He should not have cherry picked who got stimulus money.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0042.14
for any small business trying to compete with another small business that got money had no shot in hell.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0042.15
The stimulus should never have been instituted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0042.16
He should have announced on day one that the whole cap and trade thing will not pass under his watch....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0042.17
He should have thanked all business owners for their perseverence and hard work...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0042.18
not viliified them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0042.19
He should have done one of two things....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0042.20
either wait until next term to pass healthcare...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0042.21
or allowed business owners to know exactly what it will cost them...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0042.22
something many of them still cant figure out and wont be able to figure out for 2 more years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0042.23
Thats a start.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0043.23
He extended the Bush tax cuts
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0043.24
That is part of being a democrat.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0043.25
Therefore, there are two sides to the issue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0043.26
The private sector saw an increase of 2.5 million jobs under the stimulus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0043.27
Villified them?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0043.28
That is complete hyperbole.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0043.29
You may have a point about the healthcare bill.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0044.1
Obama IS NOT helping the economy to recover, he is slowing its growth
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0044.2
Good luck with that one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0045.3
True, but Obama has done a lot for small businesses:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0045.4
1) He extended loan programs for small businesses.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0045.5
2) He established an initiative for small businesses in rural areas.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0045.6
3) He was half successful in trying to eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0045.7
4) Create a $3000 tax credit for businesses adding jobs
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0045.8
5) Raise the small business investment expensing limit to a quarter of a million.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0045.9

The thing about biased sources is basically this: "That may be true, but so is this..."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0046.12
Therefore, I don't take sources like that seriously.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.15
Yes...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.16
he fianlly did...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.17
but didnt agree to do it for the business owners until the last minute....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.18
and low and behold....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.19
jobs are starting to be created.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.23
Yet there are 1.8 million jobs less than when the stiumulus was passed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.24
I explained how that happened in an earlier post.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.25
Many companies went OOB becuase they could not compete with companies that got stimulus money...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.26
and the companies that got that money hired some of those same people that lost jobs when the conmpetitor went under
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.29
yes..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.30
he villifed them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.31
Have you EVER heard him talk about the great financial risk one takes when they start a business....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.32
when they hire an employee.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.33
did he EVER mention that the last TWO employers of record of an unemployed individual contribute to their unemployment benefits....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.34
But we have heard the words "greedy" and "fat cats" and "unethical" come out of his mouth when referring to business owners.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0047.36
And the same point holds true about cap and trade.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0048.12

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0048.15
And I know why some are loosening up now and doing what they can to hire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0048.16
Many of them aren't against Obama...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0048.17
many like his social initiatives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0048.18
But NONE of them feel good about him as it pertains to their business.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0048.19
Not a single one of them does.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0049.36
Is he not right about the risk of starting a business?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.17
Local ordinances have nothing to do with Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.18
If he was renting he could have relocated and avoided the whole thing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.19
I didnt say it had anything to do with Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.20
I was talking about how regulations have an adverse affect on cpompanies desire to grow.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.21
He owned.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.22
If he had rented he was beholden to a legal contract known as a lease....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.23
and he could not have simply moved...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.24
and it wopuldnt have been his responsibility to expand the loading bay...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.25
such would be the responsibility of the property owner per conditions in the lease.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.26
I am confused...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.27
you are an employer who just gave 10% raises to all of your employees...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.28
but you are not aware of the legal obligations of a lease and who would be responsible for the adherence to local ordanances?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.29
How is that possible?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.30
Whether you own or lease, ANY business owner with a warehouse would know who is repsponsible for what as it pertains to physical property legally required alterations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0054.31
If he had twelve months to do it and he was leasing he could have easily relocated.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.1
Starting a business has some risks....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.2
you can eliminate most of them with a sound business plan....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.3
but you can not control things like weather, natural disasters, and other factors that may affect you at the most critical time...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.4
your first year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.5
But even if you have a sound business plan...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.6
and one that allows for the survival of a slow time.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.7
a business owner can not predict what congress and the President may decide...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.8
Thus why we (bunsiness owners) get really pissed off at inititaitves that are brought up in congress and addressed for years...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.9
for it doesnt allow us to forecast properly..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.10
Like cap and trade.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.11
Will it happen?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.12
Who knows.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.13
Can it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.14
Hell yeah...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.15
there is already an exchange ready to go to handle it...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.16
Will it affect cmpanies?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.17
Heck...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.18
hundreds iof not thousands will go under within a year....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.19
So as a result....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.20
many are assuming it will go through and thus are amassing as much capital as possible now to use to buy its carbon shares when it passes......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.21
and all at the expense of growing now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.22
And if it doesnt pass?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.23
Then they wilkl grow when word comes out that it will not pass...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.24
Until then?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.25
Wait, see and hoard cash.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.26
But you said your clients were loosening up and starting to hire again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.27
That means the economical outlook is good?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.28
Unemployment rates are a lagging economic indicator.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0055.29
If your clients are starting to hire again, that means recovery has been happening for a number of months now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0056.12
how about the forced closing of all those automobile dealerships.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0056.13
He actually stole people's livelihood..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0057.1
So say those that ruined it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0057.2
Democrats took over after 2006.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0057.3
And yes they did a mighty fine job driving us into the ditch.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0057.4
If Bush/Cheney were doing such outstanding employment numbers where did those jobs go?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0057.5
Was it a repeat performance of RINO REPUB bank fraud under Bush/Cheney that wrecked the economy then the job market?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0057.6
I thought congress was responsible like you guys claim they are now?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0057.7
Make up your minds.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0058.7
Dealers for the most part aren't union employees hence he didn't care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0079.5
It would probably help if supposed business owners would actually work instead of posting on internet message boards.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0079.6
But feel free to continue blaming Obama for your failures.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0079.7
Useless dribble from a useless skank
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0079.8
You're not a useless skank...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0079.9
you're good for laughs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0079.10
I guess the whole "ignore" thing didn't work out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0079.11
Gee, you can't run your business....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0079.12
little wonder you can't master an "ignore" button.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0079.13
LOL
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0079.14
I own you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0080.5
Oh please...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0080.6
Obama's shut down of the gulf oil platforms cost the region well over 100,000 jobs and caused businesses to either slow their output dramatically or shut down.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0080.7
Many of those jobs are NOT coming back.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0080.8
The other issue is how Obama's supporters can get beyond this tragic statement.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0080.9
10% unemployment is the new norm"...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0080.10
BS- and did you forget the crony oil disaster that Obama handled perfectly?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0080.11
Boom and bust, scandalous polluters...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0080.12
idiocy...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0081.15
First, I think I'd learn how to spell "lemonade".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0081.16
The entire uncertainty argument is bullshit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0082.11
Could you drop the pig Latin and try English?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0083.15
No it isn't...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0083.16
What the OP stated is 100% true.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0083.17
As a matter of fact, this is an example of precisely why many businesses refuse to expand and many others are not opening.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0083.18
There is no denying this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0083.19
There is no factual rebuttal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0084.18
BS. 90% of the uncertainty is caused by fear mongering and gov't disfunction from Pubs and their gigantic propaganda machine.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0084.19
"No compromise un-American GOP" (TIME mag) No reward for those aholes....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0085.18
Yes America...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0085.19
If you would only return to electing more republicans we could return to the business environment of 2007-2008 where we were LOSING 700,000 jobs a month.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0085.20
That is how much confidence business had in republicans
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0086.11
Democrats had control then.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0086.12
I prefer we don't return to that scenario.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0086.13
After all they were warned and just ignored it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0086.14
No thanks
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0087.13
my gawd, you have to be a real dummy to not think strangling regulations on a company doesn't HURT..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0088.1
The new GOP/wingnut talking point, now that blaming the bad economy on Obama isn't going to work anymore:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0088.2
the economy is recovering in spite of Obama, not because of him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0088.3
This is about the 4th time I've heard this today already...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0088.4
Those goalposts must be pretty heavy, ya think?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0089.4
2007-2009 is when Democrats were in charge.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0089.5
They had all the power.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888018_0089.6
During that time they destroyed a lot of jobs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888087_0018.1
Yep, because us Ron Paul supporters are just going to write him in anyway and the GOP establishment would rather put another spend-whore liberal republican or warmonger against Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888087_0018.2
Grats Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888087_0018.3
That is all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888087_0018.4
Ron Paul can always run third party if he wants to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888087_0018.5
But Obama will probably win because you have to have a really compelling reason to vote out an incumbant, and the GOP hasn't given one yet.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888087_0018.6
Try his economic disaster.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888087_0018.7
The first 2 1/2 years he had a democrat congress and he could have done anything he wanted to and he did.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888087_0018.8
Problem with that argument is
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888087_0018.9
1) The economy is finally starting to improve.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888087_0018.10
2) The GOP could be held to blame just as much as he can.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888087_0019.1
Thats right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888087_0019.2
The GOP had better get in line with the living breathing walking and talking human beings instead of the money sucking zero principal profit worshiping fake fucks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888087_0019.3
So had the Democrats, in all honesty.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.1
All the recent talk about Obama engaging in class warfare against the rich makes me laugh...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.2
and it makes me angry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.3
The rich in this country haven't had it so good since the gilded age.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.4
I'm not just talking about accumulated wealth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.5
I'm talking about having special rights that the rest of us, whether liberal or conservative, don't have.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.6
Here's a case in point:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.7
In July 2010, Martin Joel Erzinger, a $1 Billion hedge fund manager working for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, was driving his Mercedes near Vail, CO when he hit a bicyclist from behind, seriously injuring him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.8
Then he sped away without stopping, without calling the police OR calling for an ambulance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.9
He DID, however, stop some time later...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.10
to call the Mercedes auto assistance service to report damage to his vehicle and have it towed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.11
Erzinger committed TWO felonies but was only charged for 2 misdemeanors because DA Hulbert said charging him with felonies would negatively affect his career.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.12
Is that right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.13
Wouldn't that be the same for anyone?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.14
I mean, if you or I had committed the same crime, would it negatively affect our careers to be charged with 2 felonies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.15
After all, people DO go to jail for such things.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.16
And people lose their jobs when they go to jail, right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.17
You can read about the case below.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.18
<a href="http://www.summitdaily.com/article/20101108/NEWS/101109802/1078&ParentProfile=1055">DA Hurlbert won't press felony charges against hit-and-run driver because it might affect his job | SummitDaily.com</a>
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.19
In 1970, the prison population in the US was about 190,000 people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.20
In 2008, the US had 2.2 million people in prison.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.21
Today, The Economist estimates that number stands at around 2.4 million people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.22
That means that today, there are 12.5 TIMES as many people in prison then just 40 years ago.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.23
From which class of people do you think our gov't is sending to prison?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.24
Ask yourself this question!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.25
Has anyone involved in the financial meltdown of 2008 gone to prision?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.26
To trial?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.27
Has there even been any criminal investigation?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.28
How about when the Bush administration broke the law and engaged in warrantless wiretaps.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.29
They broke the law?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.30
Any consequences?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.31
The telecom companies ALSO broke the law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.32
Congress gave them retroactive immunity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.33
Remember Iran Contra?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.34
Bush 41 pardoned 6 Reagan administration officials.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.35
Ronald Reagan issued a pardon to Mark Felt, a former FBI agent, who had authorized the break-ins of homes on 9 separate occasions in a search for evidence against suspected Weatherman Underground members.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.36
They broke into their families homes, as well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.37
Of course, everyone remembers Ford's pardon of Nixon.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.38
It might interest everyone to know that France just convicted Jacques Chirac, the former president of France, for corruption.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.39
What happened to America being a nation of laws and not men?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.40
Today, I guess the powerful don't need pardons.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.41
That's because they're not prosecuted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.42
There's no plea bargain because they're not even charged with a crime.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.43
There's not even an investigation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.44
There's your class warfare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.45
Nowadays, the rich and powerful rarely get charged with serious crimes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.46
But if they do get charged, they get pardoned for their crimes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.47
Or maybe just a commutation of sentence like for Scooter Libby.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0001.48
And what happens to the 'lower classes' who don't have powerful friends or a lot of money?

According to this the 2 misdemeanors are due to a plea deal, and the guy is pleading guilty to it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0022.4
Furthermore it is his first offense, and no drugs or alcohol were involved.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0022.5
In most juristictions if it is your first offense you can usually get anything below attempted murder or rape plead down to a lesser charge.

Also, now that he has plead guilty the victim can sue the living shit out of him.

The purpose of this thread is two-fold.

First, it's to dismiss the orchestrated idea that the wealthy in this country are somehow 'victims' of class warfare when talk is floated of raising their taxes to help tackle the deficit and debt at the very same time that massive cuts are on the horizon to tackle the same deficit and debt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0044.17
Secondly, it's to show that the REAL class warfare that exists in this country in the criminal justice system actually works in FAVOR of the wealthy and well-connected at the expense of the poor and the middle class.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0044.18
Our country is supposed to be a nation of laws and not men, right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0044.19

What is ALSO unfortunate, is that while our justice system has become ever more lenient toward the rich and powerful, it's has also become increasingly merciless to the poor and the middle class because as I noted in the OP, the US has 12.5 times as many people in prison today as we had in prison 40 years ago.

However, it's the interpretation of the numbers that matters.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0045.18
If crime had gone up by 1,250% in 40 years, that could account for the higher prison numbers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0045.19
And if the population of the US had risen by the same percentage, that would also explain the increase in the number of people in prision.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0045.20
Neithe of those things is true.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0045.21
And no combination of a higher population and an increase of the crime rate can account for those numbers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0045.22

I have no issue with wealth.

I support wealth and oppose corruption.

I'm the opposite of the democrats, I suppose, who oppose wealth and favor corruption.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0059.11
HOWEVER, you find it inanely absurd (to the point that it is mindless) to think that the same wealth/power is not used to manipulate the law making process, tax code, or financial institutions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0059.12
Is that accurate?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0059.13

Wealth and power often go hand in hand, in the case of the Clintons, the wealth is a by-product of political power.

It is the connections that pervert the law though, not the wealth.

The point of those "mindless" people you accuse, is that much of that wealth and power has been accumulated through corruption and exploitation.

It creates a death spiral of take more and more without really noticing that they are getting nowhere and accomplishing nothing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888447_0061.29
The rich are never going to be the victim but the poor are being exploited by the politicians to take the ire from them and move it to a source of income for them to spend.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0028.9
They were simply asked to name whoever thay admired the most:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0028.10
What man that you have heard or read about, living today in any part of the world, do you admire most?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0028.11
And who is your second choice?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0028.12
Almost 40% chose someone that didn't even accumulate 10 votes (their dog, their cat, their dildo....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0028.13
whatever).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0028.14
Most interesting to me was that the 2011 poll had the highest number or respondents say, "None" during the past decade...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0028.15
32%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0039.1
LOL, nothing like ignoring the REAL polls...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0039.2
so Obama is going to gain momentum?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0039.3
well, where did it go in the first place?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0039.4
I guess he hasn't given enough t.v interviews or taken enough bus trips to campaign on our dime.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0039.5
Where do you get this information from that Obama uses tax payer money to do interviews and bus trips?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0039.6
He has campaign money, you know.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0039.7
That's what it is used for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0040.8
Every time Obama goes anywhere it cost taxpayers money.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0040.9
If his campaign tried to cover all the costs they would run out of money in a week.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.1
Think about this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.2
It isn't hard.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.3
Obama has topped the list 4 years in a row.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.4
Each time they've used about 1000 people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.5
Do you really think the same people have answered each year?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.6
No, they have not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.7
They make sure to use random samples each time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.8
No, but it does seem difficult for you to compare 2008 with today.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.9
In 2008, Obama won the poll with 32%
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.10
Today he won the poll with 17%
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.11
Based on the trend in random sampling, it doesn't look good for Obama winning an election in November 2012.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.12
Next time don't bring a butter knife to a gunfight.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.13
It does look good actually.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.14
He is even with Romney in most national polls and has a slight lead in some of them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.15
From here, he is only going to gain momentum.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.16
I though we were talking about the astonishing drop in Obama's popularity since he became president?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.17
Now you're talking about someone named "Romney" who is EVEN with Obama?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.18
Are you capable of staying on topic within your own threads?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.19
No, you aren't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0041.20
And quite frankly, I cannot blame you for wanting to change the subject: Even I am feeling embarassed for you....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0042.14
Come on, now you are arguing for the sake of arguing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0042.15
You can feel anything you want.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0042.16
I'm not the one overreaching.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888633_0043.3
The porn movie reference is quite appropriate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.1
The Democrat party has always fought for the working man & woman.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.2
Always?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.3
The Democrat party was also the party that fought for slavery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.4
Of course, they didn't think slaves were actually humans, so you may still be correct in your statement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.5
Actually, Medicare itself is the biggest contributor to our debt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.6
The wars certainly don't help our financial situation but you do realize the your Democrat president has started a few wars of his own, all unfunded and undeclared by Congress?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.7
The Bush tax cuts should have been repealed to help pay and we wouldn't be in this mess
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.8
Actually,tax revenues as a percentage of GDP changes very little over time, even as marginal tax rates vary widely.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.9
There is no evidence to suggest that if we had higher tax rates (no "Bush tax cuts") that we would have realized more actual revenue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.10
In fact, a strong case can be made that we have realized more revenue do to those cuts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.11
Either scenario is difficult to prove but we certainly know that your statement cannot be proven.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.12
And by the way, you do understand that Bush cut taxes for all Americans, not just the wealthy, right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.13
The last two points are just flat wrong and we all know it but I have a question for all the pubs/bags -
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.14
Why do you think using ancient history is germane to your modern day point?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.15
Pretty dumb, actually.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.16
Ah, the smart guy shares his superior intellect!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.17
Yet he offers NOTHING to support his points.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0011.18
Interesting.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0012.2
Wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0012.3
I have no idea why the facts are so hard for con-wanabes to understand, but here it is again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0012.4
There's even a nice picture for you to look at.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0012.5
<a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3036">Critics Still Wrong on What</a>

Ah, the dumb guy offers nothing to support his position because he can't.

Are you going to answer my question or are you going to blow smoke?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0013.19
Never mind.

I know you won't because you can't and I've got to leave anyway.

Enjoy the PROOF I posted in my link.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0014.6
Oh that's rich!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0014.7
I love it!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0014.8
You link to a PREDICTION of deficits in the decades to come.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0014.9
Let's deal with reality, shall we?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0014.10
For 2010, the largest budget items broke down as follows: · 20% Defense and Security · 20% Social Security · 14% Safety Net Programs · ...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0014.11
and look at this 21% for Medicare, Medicade and CHIP.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0014.12
Looks like we spend more on Medicare than anything else.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0014.13
Ergo, that's the program that most contributes to debt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0014.14
Really not that hard to understand...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0015.13
Still waiting for that proof.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0015.14
Regarding the past as an indicator of what we might expect in the future, I choose to understand history.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0015.15
You are free to repeat it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0016.1
You got Obama down pat.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0016.2
Its all Bushs fault.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0016.3
Youre a true idiot if you think Obama is for the working people while he is in a 4 million dollar house in HI
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0016.4
well, it's partly the president's fault for not kicking teatard butt so that the bush tax cuts were allowed to expire AS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0016.5
but good you have your talking points!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0016.7
you really need to change your nic...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0016.8
the word love in it is just hilarious
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.1
The last time tax receipts as a percentage of GDP were below 17% was in 1959 when they dropped to 16.2%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.2
The last time they were below 16% was in 1950 and 1949 when they were 14.4% and 14.5%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.3
To claim "Since WWII, tax revenues have stayed within 15 to 20 percent of GDP" is completely false and utterly dishonest.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.4
It is more honest and accurate to say receipts average between 17%-19%, and in the 90's were in the high 19s and hit 20 by the end.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.5
However you phrase it, we have not seen tax receipts this low as a percentage of GDP since the end of WWII.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.6
That is a fact.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.7
Additionally, you are utterly wrong about Laffer and Reagan.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.8
From 1980-82, by no means economic boom years, receipts never dipped below 19% of GDP. From 1983-1986, they never went above 18%!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.9
Just like with the Bush tax cuts, tax receipts went down not up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.10
Lastly, I am amazed by your spin on the fact that half of Americans don't pay federal income tax.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.11
If that isn't proof that taxes are their lowest in generations, I don't know what else to tell you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.12
You're simply ignoring reality and history.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.13
I am not in any way amazed by your spin on facts...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.14
I've come to expect it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.15
Nevertheless, let's take 'em one at a time:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.16
1) Glad we agree that all Americans should pay an income tax.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.17
Chalk one up for bipartisan support.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.18
2) Regan's tax rates included both increases and decreases and were not fully implemented until 1983.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.19
And what do you know, receipts stayed about the same.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.20
Amazing, isn't it?!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.21
The people has less taken out of their pockets but the government still got its revenue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.22
And yes, we stayed within that traditional 15-20 percent range.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.23
3) So you're saying I lied because since WWII, we saw 14.4% in 1950, which isn't technically 15%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.24
You got me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.25
Mia culpa.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.26
But hey, at the end of the day, I'm sure your degree in economics and experience in the field outpaces that of Art Laffer...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.27
I'm sure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.28
1) We do agree on this point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.29
However, I'm sure we disagree on how to go about it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.30
For the record, I am in favour of raising wages before we raise taxes on the working class.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.31
2) Again, no.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.32
You are ignoring history.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.33
After 1983 tax receipts dropped to below 19% and did not rise above that level until 1997!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.34
In fact, in 1981, receipts were 19.6% and in 1984 they were 17.3%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.35
That's a substantial drop that you are choosing to ignore.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.36
Why is that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.37
Oh right, because...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.38
3) You are arbitrarily picking a range.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.39
You've decided to use 15%-20%, even though since WWII, there are only a couple instances of levels as low as 15% or as high as 20%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.40
If you were being honest, which you aren't, you would use the average and 1 standard deviation, which would get you a range of 16.4%-19% (17.7% being the average).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.41
Using that range, you would see we are currently way outside the norm.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.42
As for your hero Art Laffer, you know he drew his famous curve on a napkin as a joke, right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.43
It was never meant to be taken seriously.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.44
But, since you are taking it seriously, the least you could do is be honest with yourself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.45
The Laffer Curve is a CURVE.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.46
Which means on the left side as tax rates drop so do tax revenue levels.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.47
That's what Laffer was saying and that's what you are choosing to ignore.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.48
Whether you like it or not, we are on the left side of the Laffer Curve.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.49

Raising wages?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.53
And who does that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.54
Government or the guys that actually own the business?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.55
That is not a "substantial drop"!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.56
It is a fluctuation that cannot be attributed to any one specific tax change...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.57
and there were changes in rates both up and down.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.58
You've not supported your point at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.59
Bottom line, we took less in taxes and revenues stay about the same...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.60
which has been the case for 60 years now when rates go down or up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.61
Pick whatever range you want.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.62
You have no evidence that marginal rate changes have a direct correlation to changes in revenue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.63
Sorry, you just don't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.64
I understand the Laffer curve and yes, we are on the left side of that curve, exactly as Laffer would have predicted in an economic downturn.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.65
You can bitch all you want about tax rates.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.66
There are a hell of a lot of us that are done with the idea of tweaking rates for the benefit of some and the detriment of others.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.67
We want a flat, fair and wide base and most importantly, for the government to live within it's means.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0018.68
Deal with it at the ballot box.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0019.4
says a birther, shut up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.57
You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.58
17.7% has been the average since WWII.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.59
One standard deviation below that is 16.4%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.60
TWO standard deviations below that is 15.1% And we are even below that!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.61
Yet, you think this is normal and fine?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.62
That this is within the acceptable range?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.63
A range you just made up?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.64
Apparently someone flunked his college stats class.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.65
When we were over by two standard deviations, Bush went on TV crying over how the government was taking in too much money and had to give it back.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.66
Now we're on the other side the same way...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.67
and you don't care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.68
You choose to ignore it like every other "conservative".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.69
Way to go.

You don't understand the Laffer Curve.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.71
It doesn't change based on the strength of the economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.72
Do some reading.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0020.73
Your ignorance is showing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888644_0021.5

who gets her money through a socialistic structure..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0013.1
How, How, How...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0013.2
on God's green earth can Conservatives square THIS little bit of nuggetry from the Newt?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0013.3
Newt, in politics, has a near perfect conservative record over 35 years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0013.4
No one can match that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0013.5
Any change he wants in government is toward a more conservative government that would in effect make liberalism nearly illegal as our Founders intended with the Constitution.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0013.6
Please nominate Gingrich....

Gingrich Plummets in Polls as Voters Start Remembering Who He Is
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0014.2
Dawning Awareness Threatens Campaign
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0014.4
DES MOINES ( <a href="http://bit.ly/rIvDGZ">The Borowitz Report</a> ) – In a development that has imperiled his front-runner status in the Republican presidential race, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has plunged in the polls as voters have begun to remember who he is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0014.5
Mr. Gingrich had been surging in recent weeks, but according to pollster Davis Logsdon of the University of Minnesota’s Opinion Research institute, “That was before people’s memories of who New Gingrich is started gradually kicking in.”
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0014.6
According to a new poll released today, Mr. Gingrich fared especially poorly among voters who agreed with the statement, “Wait a minute, that guy?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0014.7
He was an enormous dick.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0014.9
“Newt Gingrich has got to do something fast to keep people from remembering who he is,” pollster Logsdon said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0014.10
“He might try growing a moustache or wearing an eye patch, but that might be too little, too late.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0014.12
On the ground in Iowa, Gingrich campaign strategists are working overtime to confront the challenge posed by voters remembering who he is, aides to the former House Speaker said today.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0014.13
According to one campaign source, the Gingrich campaign has begun seeking the support of people with mental disorders and other memory issues that make it hard for them to retain basic information.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0014.14
“The problem is, most of those people are currently running for President,” the source said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0014.15
In other political news, the Romney campaign unveiled a new slogan today: “You’re Out of Other Options.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0015.1
I didn't forget.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888806_0015.2
Hes an even bigger dickweed today than he was back in '95.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.1
I hope you are right as my daughter hates her job and I would like to see her find another.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.2
Companies have been holding cash for a while now and without demand, there is no need to hire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.3
They are making a profit without new employees.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.4
Other bad signs for the economy are:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.5
-the downward adjusted housing numbers · -paltry GDP numbers · -real unemployment rate
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.6
Good news though include:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.7
-consumer confidence is up · -durable goods numbers up
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.8
What this great country needs now is the two sides to stop pushing agenda items and start making decisions that make economical sense.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.9
Your daughter should start looking now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.10
Tell her to get a good resume together and start submitting them online.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.11
Having a job is easier then not having one when looking.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.12
Employers like hiring people away from other firms.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.13
First..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.14
it's almost a seamless transition and second, if it's a rival then all the better.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.15
And the "profits" they are making are accounting tricks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.16
It doesn't last forever.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.17
And really, it's them that started the loss of demand.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.18
For two reasons.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.19
They wanted to cut high labor costs by hiring overseas and creating a glut of people looking for work.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.20
Initially layoffs had nothing to do with loss of demand.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.21
It was "synergy".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.22
Eventually..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.23
that's what started to happen, because UE got so high.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.24
But now..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.25
even the Chinese factories are in trouble because people are not buying their cheap crap.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.26
Thus, people are starting to look for government solutions to the problem.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.27
And quite frankly, alot of things need to be done.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.28
Infrastructure, implementing new tech like cloud and IPv6, and high speed rail.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.29
However..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.30
that could tighten the high tech/engineer market again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.31
Which would be bad for alot of these companies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.32
Which is one reason I think a hiring boom will happen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.33
What better time to snap up well trained peeps who've been out of work for awhile.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.34
And they get them on the cheap, while looking like "heroes".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.35
In other words - Sallow is hoping for another mass bailout and enormous government spending.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0015.36
But no worries...

Obama wants to cut 3 $trillion out of the deficit in 10 years (which will of course increase the deficit not decrease it)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0016.35
Will do, thanks for the advice.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0017.1
These are just musings..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0017.2
but lately there's been alot of frenzied activity from recruiters.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0017.3
And I just went to the office party of my old job and while talking to some of the guys there, many people who were looking for a year or more are getting snapped up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0017.4
What's going on?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0017.5
Well aside from the economy getting better, the Bush tax cuts are set to expire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0017.6
And there's not much evidence they did anything to help.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0017.7
Employers are sitting on tons and tons of liquidity and playing "shell games" to keep making money..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0017.8
without adding to the overall economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0017.9
Given the present anger in the public at large, I have a feeling that to quell some of this..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0017.10
there will be a hiring boom.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0017.11
Who knows...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0017.13
I don't think you'll see a "Hiring boom" till after the 2012 elections and that would depend greatly on the outcome.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0018.1
of course you think that willow.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0018.2
Tell us when the last time you were right in a prediction?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0019.3
we'll have to wait and see won't we dog breath.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0020.1
you have made them before, did you ever get one right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0033.30
Actually..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0033.31
some states are doing what the Fed won't..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0033.32
and adding Stimulus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0033.33

And Cuomo kiboshed the idea of killing the millionaire's tax in favor of putting together a package of infrastructure projects.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0033.36
And walking around the city you can see construction is booming.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0033.37
I assume you have noticed that colleges have been in a massive growth boom for the past 7-8 years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0033.38
School construction has never been better.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0033.39
And who could be surprised?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0033.40
We are just now beyond the height of the education bubble created by the government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0033.41
And it will burst.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0033.42
And it will be ugly when it does.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0033.43
I would think you would not be in favor of this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0033.44
I would assume you don't like how tuition has ballooned in the past decade?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.2
What exactly are you basing this on?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.3
On another blog several years ago I said corporations wouldn't be hiring for a while for a number of reasons.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.4
-They wanted to cut benefits and wages.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.5
-They wanted to make the President look bad to loosen regulations or get another guy in office.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.6
That position got slammed..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.7
but it turned out to be pretty true.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.8
They aren't hiring.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.9
But not for the reasons you state.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.10
You imaginarium is running along the paranoid lines.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.11
I've seen many small business owners interviewed and have listened to many who are members here on this board..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.12
A. Thousands of anti business regulations from obama
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.13
B. obama care and the associated costs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.14
c. Uncertainty in an anti business enviornment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.15
D. They're not look forward to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.16
so,, we'll wait and see who is right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.17
A. Which ones?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.18
B. Cost of Healthcare was rocketing up prior to ObamaCare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.19
Employers were asking for more of a contribution from Employees.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.20
C. What "Anti-Business" environment?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.21
Did interest rates suddenly spike?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.22
Several rounds of QE were "anti-business"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0034.23
D. Read my OP.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0035.19
Outstanding point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0036.1
and why would an employer hire new employees that he may have to lay off later and then know he's going to have to pay unemployment benefits for a lifetime?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0036.2
who in the hell would knowingly do that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0036.3
Please.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0036.4

Has the amount of millionaires and billionaires in this country gone up or down in the past 30 years?

Seriously..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0039.5
come into the real world.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0040.13
I hope you are right cause we need a hiring boom, alot of people are out of jobs and need the work.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0041.3
With that kind of attitude why hire anyone?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0041.4
that business would be a one man shop.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0041.5
Plus unemployment is hardly a life time, it varies depending on state but there is always an expiration date on that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0042.19
What spin?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0042.20
I address your points and asked some questions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0042.21

It appears the stockpile of the foreclosures is finally beginning to disappear.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0043.3
Plus, commercial investors are coming back to the table.

2012 may be a year of unexpected recovery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0044.14
that's obama's cross to bear.

poor him.

A company that hires through a temp service.

A temp service always has 2 customers, at least.

One to bring people in for the pay.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0047.6
And one that just sucks that almost no one will take.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0047.7
When the big payer ends, the temp co can offer the worker the shitty job, hoping they won't take it, so it's a voluntary quit and thus no UE>

What kind of work do you do?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0049.19
It's no "bubble".

The world comes to the United States to educate it's people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0049.21
The United States Colleges and Universities are top flight..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0049.22
bar none.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0050.5
Great time to add another fee to those taking out mortgages then.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0051.6
Why?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.2
I was application support for trading and market data systems.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.3
I also helped build out NOCs, RNOCs, contigency floors and data centers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.4
I was the SME for a proprietary application that we sold to customers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.5
Before that I did consulting for application and hardware migrations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.6
I have admin level experience with HPUX, SUSE, and RHEL.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.7
Applications and OS's that I am familiar with include TIDAL/BIG BROTHER/HP Openview/TANDEM NonStop/Remedy/Service Now/Tripwire/Perforce.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.8
I've trained ITIL v1, v2 and v3.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.9
I can write PERL/KSH scripts and use SQL. And I just completed a CCNA class...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.10
so I am studying to take the certification test.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.11
That..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.12
and I make a really mean omlette!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.14
Well...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.15
for starters.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.16
If you look anything like your avatar, I think I may know what your problem is and why you cant find a job.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.18
I just copied and pasted your qulifications on a word doc.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.19
I am going to make some calls to people I kow that do tech and see if your qualificatiuons are something they may be able to present to a client.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.20
If I get any positive repsonse, I will PM you...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.21
and do something I am very much against doing...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.22
but would do iot for you....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.23
give you my personal/business information.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.24
And if I do...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.25
just an fyi...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.26
I have a very vicious puggle guarding my house.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.27
Hey thanks!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0069.28
The offer to have you buy me a beer still stands.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0070.1
Who said anything about unemployment for life?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0070.2
they keep extending it,, what do you think that means?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0070.3
soon there will never be a satisfactory cut off point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.5
OMG....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.6
there is no way you just denied that education is a bubble market right now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.7
You didn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.8
Wow.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.9
I suppose you can call anything a bubble if you like..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.10
and point to things to support your point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.11
My understanding of a "bubble" is a sector that is artificial propped up..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.12
despite weak demand.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.13
Like the "Housing" bubble at the beginning of the Bush administration.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.14
There is Strong demand for US education.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.15
And that's world wide.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.16
Low cost loans, credit not a problem.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.17
Try thinking beyond that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.18
Add state government increasing funding to buy votes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.19
One Result is higher tuition.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0071.20
But those teachers deserve all that money and perks on the tax payer dime right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0072.1
There is !
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0072.2
There is !!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0072.3
It's called WW3.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0072.4
Here's dougie downer to shoot to pieces another thread.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0072.5
Why the heck are you so unhappy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0072.6
You've got a real cute "rent-a-wife" and live in the tropics.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0073.17
Yep.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0073.18
People are just standing in lines waitin' to become teachers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0073.19
Hoo boy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0073.20
And cab drivers too!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0073.21
Although I think cab drivers pay slightly better.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.6
Actually, as an owner of a temporary placement agency (we are a business planning and human resources solutions firm in the NYC area), it does not actually work that way.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.7
We can not offer a temp a lower salary and then deny him/her unemployment if he/she rejects the assignment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.8
It willbe a valid rebuttle and we would lose.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.9
Furthermore, we would never want to alienate a good tempoorary employee with such an act.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.10
Maybe some of the smaller shops that try to maximize revenue at the cost of quality service do...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.11
but as someone in the industry for over two decades, 75% of that time as an owner, that is only successful for the short term.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.12
For your inventory (temps) is at a constant and constantly rotating in and out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.13
You need to grow inventory to grow revenue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.14
What many people dont realize is we value our temps as much as we value our clients.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.15
We must perform superior customer service for all of them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.16
I never had any luck with the temp agencies, one time I got a voice mail from one of them saying they had a job for me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.17
I called back, and the lady said sorry since you didn't answer we offered the job to the next person on the list who answered the phone, that didn't make any damn sense to me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.18
Part of our business is very time sensitive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.19
We may get a call from a client saying that they need something and called another service as well..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.20
and the one who performs the quickest gets the order.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.21
We explain that to our tempos when they apply with us so they understand the importance of always being reachable..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.22
to the best oif their ability.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.23
We have some temps that make great money with us.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.24
Great relationships.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.25
We give them bonuses this time a year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.26
Last few years they werent overly impressive...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.27
but the appreciation was there...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.28
and returned with GREAT quality and a great representation of our firm.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.29
I suggest you spread yourself out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.30
It is a matter of establishing yourself with one who sees your differential...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.31
whatever it may be.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.32
Present yourself as confident, reliable, and willing to do whatever you can to represent them at the highest of levels.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.33
dont make it like "I need to make money...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.34
or....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.35
im desperate...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.37
Im doing this only so unemployemtn sees I am looking for a job.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.38
Instead, make it like you are an asset to them.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.39
not that they are an asset to you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0074.40
You will find you are treated with great respect with that typoe of approach.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0075.29
lol.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0075.30
If I help you find a job, it will be my pleasure to buy you a beer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0076.18
Just say, the topic is beyond your understanding and its all good.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0076.19
Great move having government take over loans and reduce the payment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0076.20
You will be paying longer and more interest.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0077.16
Then you are the only one, or the laws in PA are different.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0077.17
I dont know if the laws are different.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0077.18
But the unemployment rep has the authority to apporve or denyt unemployment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0077.19
It is not black and white.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0077.20
Conditions, circumstances, outside forces are considered...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0077.21
and there is always sympathy for the one making the claim.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0077.22
The only people we deny unemployment to are ones that refuse to take an assignemnt at their rate three times in a row.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0077.23
And we document every event.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0078.16
Beyond my understanding?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0078.17
My mom just retired.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0078.18
She was a teacher.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0078.19
She started out with shit pay..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0078.20
long hours and lots of long nights.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0078.21
She had to get her masters.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0078.22
That and I've had a few friends that were college professors.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0078.23
One guy did it during his time searching for another radio producer gig.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0078.24
He taught one class and was done.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0078.25
Shit pay..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0078.26
So yeah..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0078.27
I have first hand experience with it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.1
they have in place in most companies cutters and slashers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.2
This only works for a few years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.3
They cut and slash their way in a bloated system to profits.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.4
At some point there is no more fat to cut.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.5
The corps will settle for profit any way its made.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.6
When slash and burn is done you have to make profits some way.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.7
At the point that they need to hire to make more profits they will hire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.8
No republican tricks like trashing the debt ceiling or refusing tax cuts to the middle (EVEN while they claim they are all about tax cuts ) will stop the corps from finding profits.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.9
Unfortunately for the right we have about hit the point where to make more profits the corps are going to have to hire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.10
While the republicans will do ANYTHING for corporations you see the corporations are not as devoted to the republicans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.11
They will not hold back jsut to help you get elected if there are profits to be made.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.12
You serve a disloyal mistress cons.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.14
Who would have thought that TM was a Captain of Industry!?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.15
"we have about hit the point where to make more profits the corps are going to have to hire."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.16
We have, "Hit the point?"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.17
What "point" would that be?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.18
I thought the only way to Save An Economy was to raise taxes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0079.19
and allow government to "create" jobs using a Massive Stimulous Package?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0080.36
I'm all good now I got a full time job with the feds.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0081.24
No, you had SECOND Hand experience.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0081.25
You never actually were a teacher: This would have given you first hand experience.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0082.28
Eventually we'll all be good with "a full time job with the Feds."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0083.28
Mr. Obama?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0083.29
Is that you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0083.30
If it is, you're going to be losing that job in about a year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0083.31
So you may want to consider my advice.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0084.3
My tongue was planted firmly in my cheek, referring to the new fee in the payroll extension that dings folks getting or renewing mortgages.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0084.4
Insignificant
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0085.11
My understanding of a "bubble" is a sector that is artificially propped up..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0085.16
Um...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0085.17
what?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0085.18
Using your definition - there was no housing bubble.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0085.19
A bubble is a market that is artificially propped up for any reason.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0085.20
Including creating an ARTIFICIAL demand.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0085.21
Education demand is false.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0085.22
It is not reality.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0085.23
We have eons of kids who couldn't graduate high school getting 4 year loans including room and board.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0085.24
No college in their right mind would accept these kids in the past, and not one bank would give them a loan prior to the government guaranteeing the loan.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0085.25
Colleges are filled with kids who don't belong there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0085.26
And the only reason they are there is because of insane student loan practices that are identical in everyway to the insane mortgage loan practices.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0086.4
to you maybe.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0087.4
20 bucks a week isn't?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0087.5
Especially when you give 1 week a month back if you ever get or renew another mortgage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0088.28
Yer gonna make every Liberal's Head Explode with that kinda reality.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0089.21
I did teach a Tae Kwon do class..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0089.22
and a Gymnastics class once..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0089.23
Does that count?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0089.25
Okay..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0089.26
I stand corrected.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0090.23
So you helped little boys do back hand spings, back flips with full twists and...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0090.24
dare I say.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0090.25
back bends?

Mr. Sandusky?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0090.27
Is that you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0091.24
Since I was a public school teacher, I'll let you pass.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0092.30
How do you figure that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0093.13
How did I know that was coming?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0094.23
Again...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0094.24
I am not just talking about domestic demand.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0094.25
And I am surprised by the "Kids who don't belong there" crapola.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0094.26
Every American kid belongs in college.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0094.27
In any case..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0094.28
Bush cut taxes..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0094.29
and lowered interest rates to zero.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0094.30
That..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0094.31
and the deregulation brought about by the loss of Glass-Steagall created a plethora of predatory loan companies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0094.32
That's a real bubble.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.14
Do you know something that I dont know about the power of the president???
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.15
The only way I see any president influencing the economy in a good way is by representing populist opinion that is based in sound economic theory.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.16
Aside from the power to veto and the command of the military the president is not intended to have all that much actual power.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.17
He is totally dependent on the congress.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.18
I just want to see your thoughts behind your statement, if you have any.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.19
I am also interested to know what candidate you think would best fill the role that you have in mind.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.20
Ron Paul is the only one I see with any real plan that is within his power and is totally doable even with the 'do nothing' congress.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.21
Returning all the troops home from any country that requests it would be one hell of a start.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.22
Thats 200-300 thousand people with good middle class jobs moving into every neighborhood in the country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.23
The border will be secured, which will cause the value of labor to rise.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.24
Plundering of the treasury and destruction of the dollar will be halted through the power of the veto.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.25
A competing currency will be introduced, although that must go through congress so there is little hope presently.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.26
Inflation will continue for years however as the market finds equilibrium from the 97% erosion of dollar values.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.27
Most important is the reductions in spending.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.28
Consider the 1 trillion in cuts a start.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.29
1 trillion is kinda a magic number, its just enough to start seriously addressing the debt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.30
Overnight confidence the dollar will begin surge.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.31
So this is going to effect the market hard and fast in three very good ways.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.32
Purchasing power of the general public is going to rise, regulations that prevent competition and expansion of economy will be reduced, and lower taxes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0104.33
If we bring all the troops home with no bases overseas, I see a big cut in Military personnel so there won't be that many people spending money here like you say, if we don't maintain a presence overseas we won't need a Military of this size.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0105.30
"Every kid belongs in college" - that is a huuuge pile of dog poo.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0105.31
A kid who can't (for whatever reason) hack high school in no way will be successful in higher education.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0105.32
That is really dumb thinking Sallow.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0105.33
And another thing....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0105.34
the housing bubble started in the Bush admin?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0105.35
C'mon...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0105.36
I would expect better from you than that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0105.37
That is T-M and Rdean speak.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.20
Started?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.21
No..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.22
not completely.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.23
But it went into overdrive with Bush.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.24
When Romney talked about letting some mortgages lapse to clear the market..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.25
that should have occurred at the beginning of 2001.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.26
And kids not "hacking" high school..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.27
do so for any number of reasons..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.28
that need to be addressed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.29
Unless there is some physical deficiency..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.30
no one is born stupid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.31
Sigh....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.32
it is this kind of thinking that is destroying education.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.33
Liberals not wanting to admit that not everyone is cut out for higher education.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.34
Liberals modifying testing results because they don't like the image it presents.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0120.35
Liberals giving wholesale passes to minorities who are failing their class but refuse to give them failing grades, and do everything in their power to skew the grading curve so that you would practically have to rape a fellow student, in class - to fail.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0121.31
BOOOOOSH!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0121.32
For Christssakes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0121.33
Barney Frank and the Dem Congress were on vacation for 8 years???
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0121.34
I wish you Partisan shites would fucking pay attention.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0121.35
Maybe if I made it Simple:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0121.36
Since 1945, The Republicans only controlled BOTH the Presidency and the Senate and the HoR for FOUR (4) YEARS; during the 108th and 109th congress.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0122.1
Housing and construction are the backbones of this economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0122.2
They are both showing improvement and the confidence level is improving.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0122.3
I think many economist may be surprised at the amount of growth we will see by year's end (2012)....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0122.4
or the world could come to an end.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0123.1
From what I've seen or read, most economists do not expect GDP to be much higher than 2.5%, some think closer to 2% or even lower.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0123.2
That ain't going to translate into a hiring boom.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0123.3
Wish it would happen, a lotta people need a job, but I'm not seeing it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0123.4
The interesting thing is, there are MANY job openings.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0123.5
So why can't they be filled?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0123.6
You show me a bunch of women that worked in a bank in Atlanta, GA, and ask them to drive 18 wheelers in North Dakota during January, then I'll show you a bunch of unemployed people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0123.7
Some of the jobs are low paying manual labor that many people don't want to do, especially if they're getting a UE check.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0123.8
Some jobs require a specific skill that most people don't have, and again, those that do are collecting that UE check.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0123.9
No doubt there are other reasons as well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0124.27
And they didn't have a filibusterproof Senate either.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0125.10
I'm sure you're right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0125.11
However, most UE pays for JOB TRAINING.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0125.12
So, if you don't have the skill (driving an 18 wheeler), you can be trained.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0125.13
You are correct: It's easier to sit in a park in NYC and bitch-and-moan than to learn a skill that is marketable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0125.14
BTW if anyone IS interested in doing more than "protesting," Boulder County will pay for your $4000, 3 week, truck driving class.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0125.15
Of course you gotta have a clean UA, and a good driving record.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0125.16
Starting pay is about $40K/yr
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0125.17
Experience maxes out at about $80k/yr.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0126.13
Soon there will be no way to hide the bad economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0126.14
No amount of fuzzy numbers will cover it up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0126.15
Some experts predict things will get worse at the beginning of 2012.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0126.16
People get lazy when they think the government can come and save them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0126.17
Thing is who's going to save the government with the bottom falls out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0127.31
why?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0128.13
lets get back to the hiring boom.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889109_0128.14
please detail what you would consider a hiring boom, I am curious.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0037.1
The lie was the poster's claim that Foxnews never ran with this story until after she was fired.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0037.2
C'mon...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0037.3
grow up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0037.4
You angry leftists are so quick to throw not only the 'racist' accusation, but the word 'lie'.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0037.5
Now, here you are challenged to prove the lie charge, and you are unable to do so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0037.6
Were I a leftist, I would, of course, accuse you of 'lying' with your charge, as it is clear that the video provided in post #14 is in no way a lie, nor could you misunderstand my post which indicated that the vid was dispositive as to Fox being fair.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0037.7
So, I'll simply leave you with the brand of immature, angry, sophomoric, spittle-spewing, left wing janissary, infused with the desire to paint opponents with vituperation, rather than banter about the value of each others' ideas.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0037.8
There, now, isn't that more literate than 'lying racist'...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0037.9
what?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0037.10
you don't believe FOX NEWS?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0037.11
FOX news says themselves that they REPORTED IT FIRST.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0037.12
The Agriculture Department announced Monday, shortly after FoxNews.com published its initial report on the video, that Sherrod had resigned.

Try to read the entire thread before post, as it will make you appear less silly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0037.15
The point here was not whether or not Fox News went with the story, but, that, in a fair and balanced manner, the Glenn Beck Show put the story in its correct context.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0037.16
Note post #14 above.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0038.1
Shirley Sherrod, we now know that her video was edited, yet it was played on Fox again and again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0038.2
And when poor Shirley was forced to resign, Fox comes out with a report, just tonight, that Obama threw an "innocent" woman under the bus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0038.3
Now, Fox says she's innocent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0038.4
Only now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0038.5
Except, you have zero evidence that Fox even played the clip until after the Administration forced her to resign over it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0038.6
In fact, watching Fox will tell you the exact opposite of what you are claiming.

Of course, you will continue to pretend Fox has been attacking her all along.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0038.9
But the fact is, you idiots fired her before anyone knew about the story.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0038.10
Bill O'Reilly did this story on MONDAY.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0038.11
Department of Agriculture official Shirley Sherrod was caught on tape saying how difficult it was for her to provide assistance to a white farmer.

When was she fired??
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0038.15
According to her, Monday afternoon before Glenn Beck came on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0039.1
This is how the people on the right here treat truth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0039.2
This is why the right is destined to lose its ass.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0039.3
No group can be so deliberately dishonest and win over the American voter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0039.4
They cheat in elections, they lie about nearly everything and hate everyone who varies even a little bit from what they already have cemented in their brain cases.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0039.5
They are killing themselves as a politcal force.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0039.6
I don't know about that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0039.7
You lie through your teeth and still get votes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0040.1
Meaning that it was not the Glenn Beck Show?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0040.2
Or, what, then, was the lie?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0040.11
Since Foxnews has admitted running the story before the announcement of the resignation,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0040.12
you are wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0041.1
The USDA and the NAACP should have verified the story before they jumped the gun and threw Ms Sherrod under the bus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0041.2
They only checked it after they drove that big ass bus over Ms. Sherrod.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0041.3
Then, Golly Gee, Whoops, they found the story was taken out of context.

Fox news will not stop lying becuase they have to lie to defend the right.

to be intimidated by the noisy right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0043.4
And boy do you people ever try.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0051.1
fox news is balanced somewhere between rightwingnut and malitia audiance
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0051.2
More proof that the administration was absolutely right in their assertions that Foxnews is NOT a news organization.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0051.3
Maybe this incident will compel the administration to man up and knock Fox, and the rest of the rightwing propaganda machine, on its ass.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0051.4
Even if this assertion about Oreilly is correct...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0051.5
he is not a newscaster.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0051.6
He is a commentator giving his opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0051.7
He should still be accurate with his opinion, but he isn't a newscaster.

Not to mention...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0052.12
on the local news today, they had a caller trying to defend this racist bitch saying "she was taken out of context"...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0052.13
the problem is that she sure reveled in riling up the crowd with her story of 'sticking it to this white farmer'...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0052.14
and the crowd would not be knowing that she would be adding more at the end, was SURE APPLAUDING her story of what she did...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0052.15
showing even more the racist bullshit of the NAACP
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0052.16
But we will have the leftists defending racism once again, as long as it is within their ranks
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0053.9
There was the problem for the NAACP in that they had just cast out the charge that the Tea Party was 'racist,' and didn't want to be tarred with the same brush...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0053.10
And the administration had been so thoroughly dinged by exposures of prior vetting errors that that sought to end the episode quickly...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0053.11
Anita Dunn follows Mao, and Van Jones claims to be a communist...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0053.12
sort of hoist by their own petard, huh?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0053.13
And the irony is that Glenn Beck outflanks them!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0053.14
He indicated that the official was not behaving in a 'racist' manner.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0053.15
You're absolutely right that it was the worst kind of rush to judgment which was made based on past performance BY FOX.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0053.16
Why is it Fox needs to keep some obscure "story" alive for weeks on end, such as the Van Jones thing?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0053.17
What is THEIR "intent"??
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0053.18
Within the realm of national priorities, that issue should have been a back page two-liner, but Fox managed to build it into such a big deal that The Stupids assumed the Constitution would soon be replaced by the Communist Manifesto.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0054.1
C'mon...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0054.16

except he's not wrong about the rightwingnuts setting her up...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0058.3
yet another reason obama needs to stop giving in to them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0058.4
it just encourages the loons.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0058.5

I am not among the six percent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0058.10
Obviously.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.1
C'mon...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.8
I do hope after your rant, you will proceed to answer my question: What was Mr. Brietbart's intention in posting only the portion of the Sherrod video which seems to indicate she is spewing nothing but racist comments?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.9
Was it, gasp, a desire to paint opponents (particularly black people) as angry racists?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.10
What is Limbaugh's or Beck's "intent" when they take some innocuous comment uttered by someone in the Obama administration, or the president himself, and create an entire show about it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.11
Mr. Brietbart made his agenda clear when he began his website, i.e. to counter the multitude of left wing sites and publications.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.12
He is doing just that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.13
Now, as for "a desire to paint opponents (particularly black people) as angry racists," this bit of projection on your part has given a glimpse into your attitude, mind, and agenda.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.14
Moving on...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.15
"What is Limbaugh's or Beck's "intent" when they take some innocuous comment uttered by someone in the Obama administration,..."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.16
how lucky we Americans are to have the antidote to the left wing propaganda to which you subscribe.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.17
The irony is that you have misused the word innocuous, which means "Having no adverse effect; harmless" and inadvertently, once again, shown who you are.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.18
In my America it is hardly innocuous to have a self-proclaimed communist selected by the President, and another who looks to Mao for guidance in the same select group...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.19
again chosen by the President.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.20
Perhaps a better strategy for you would have been to use President Obama's defense for his numerous missteps, as I believe he said early in his failed presidency, "Elections have consequences..."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.21
That means that "I can put communists, loony scientists like Holdren, AG's who won't prosecute blacks if the victim is white, Medicare chiefs who plan on redistributing the wealth, or State Department officials who announce that the Arizona law is equivalent to Chinese human rights abuses..."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.22
That's what 'elections have consequences' means....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.23
and I don't see anything innocuous in the above.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.24
How'd ya like that rant?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.25
Loony scientists?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0061.26

awwwwwwwww
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0063.6
you can bet they wouldn't be shedding a tear if this had been a Republican.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0063.8
Nobody in the media pays any attention to Republican shenanigans, that's why. The guy running for Governor of Colorado, for example, caught plagiarizing then blaming someone else for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0063.9
How much air time did that get?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0063.10
If it had been a Dem, and if it had happened even six months ago, we'd still be seeing it recycled by Republican bloggers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0063.11
Hell, they're even still talking about Biden's plagiarizing a college thesis 40 years ago!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0063.12
Conservatives have the loudest voices this political cycle, and I know why. Do you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0063.13
It's because the right, that party of "morals", don't have "low" standards.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0063.14
They have "No" standards.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0064.15
Ya...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0064.16
thats right we have no morals (sarcasm)....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0064.17
Are you trying to force your morals on us?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0064.18
A liberal wouldn't do that...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0064.19
would they?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.5
What video?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.6
What report?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.7
Then there's James OKeefe and Acorn.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.8
A single Republican, able to bring down an organization that helped the poor, from spliced together video tapes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.9
Well, he is getting sued.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.10
But, "he did it".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.11
Now all those poor people are a little more poor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.12
WTF are you talking about?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.13
Then there were Republican leaders privately telling Obama that they would work with him and then publicly, saying they would do everything they could to bring him down (they called it "Waterloo").
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.14
And they did.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.15
And poor Obama believed them time and time again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.16
I wonder if he believes them now?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.17
"They" who?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.18
Which Republican leaders?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.19
There was Iraq.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.20
That was because of WMDs, no, because of yellow-cake, no, it was to bring "freedom", no, it was.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.21
How many years back are we going to go here?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.22
There was the 2.4 trillion dollar tax cut.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.23
Supposed to bring jobs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.24
And it did.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.25
It brought them to China and India and even Mexico.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.26
Still looking backwards?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.27
Then there was April 16th 2008, Healthcare Decisions Day, proclaimed by the former Gov. of Alaska, Sarah Palin.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.28
In fact, it was such a good idea, that Democrats used the SAME legislation in the Health Care Bill.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.29
Only Sarah stopped calling it, "Healthcare Decisions Day", no, instead she called it "death panels" and "kill grandma".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.30
Another fast one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.31
Never heard of it.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.32
Link?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.33
And this unemployment bill?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.34
Stripped of everything that would help the economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.35
Now Republicans say, "Where's the roads being built?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.36
Where's the dam's being restored?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.37
Where's the bridges being fixed?"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.38
Well, they should know.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.39
They forced Democrats into removing them from any legislation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.40
Roads, dams, and bridges were supposed to be paid for with the failed Stimulus package, not the 'unemployment bill'.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.41
Imagine if Republicans put all the sneakiness into helping the middle class.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.42
Into actually rebuilding the country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.43
Into being on the side of regular Americans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.44
Yea, imagine that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0076.45

I'm not making a case for anything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.2
Just stated a fact, which I note you brilliantly ignored.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.3
Population control has been a topic for deep discussion for many, many decades and I really don't lose much sleep wondering whether or not someones dissertation on the subject will become a reality anytime soon.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.4
Because I know it won't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.5
And so does Erlich.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.6
1. Your post is an absurd conflation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.7
Since the 'science czar' of the left believed we should poison 'excess' population, you seem to feel it necessary, defensive, to claim that there is any resonance on the right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.8
a. School of population control is know as eugenics, and well known to be a part of the constellation of inhumanities sought by the progressives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.9
b. I'm sure you have read 'The Population Bomb.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.11
I was being kind to you to ignore the parviscience of your post.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.12
2. I have not formed a comprehensive opinon on immigration, so I do not post on the subject.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.13
Translation: I have not yet researched my vast repertoire of right-wing information regarding immigration control in order to post carefully selected opinions of others with which to make my own case on the subject.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.14
Maybe tomorrow, PC?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.16
I think that unless you can point to any untruths on my part, you should accept what I say about my personal motivations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.17
If and when I can find a comprehensive immigration policy with which I can agree, I will post it and champion it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.18
I give a great deal of thought to my positions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0077.19
BTW, to state that my perspective is right wing requires not much prescience...

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0078.60
And what's happening today is because of what happened, uh, "backward".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0078.61
Goofs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0078.62
I don't spend my days surfing for news bytes to find something to bitch about.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0078.63
Contrary to the persistent vomiting of 24hr news networks, the news doesn't really change as often as their advertisers would have you believe.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0078.64
You opened with vague remarks, assuming the world knows WTF you're talking about, and respond by calling people goofs for not being as lacking in a real life so as not to be stuck watching bullshit 24/7 like you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0079.21
Vague?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0079.22
What was vague?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0079.23
About Shirley Sherrod?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0079.24
About James OKeefe and Acorn?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0079.25
About Health Care Decisions day?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0079.26
About the unemployment bill?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0079.27
What was "vague"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0079.28
Those are truths Republicans can't bear to face.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0080.1
Let's overlook the tools mentioned and focus on this unemployment bill you're obsessing about?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0080.2
Is there really monies in this UE ext. bill for roads and brisges?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0081.1
this is from FOX on 7/19
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0081.3

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0081.4
weird huh?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0082.35
Since we've established that Fox didn't play the editted clip until the OReilly Factor at 8pm and the administration demanded her resignation before 5pm, can we expect you to correct false accusation against Fox News about playing the clip again and again?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0083.3
Nope.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0083.4
I don't expect it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0083.5
I expect to hear a string of fresh bullshit about FOX's previous instances of biased reporting.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0084.2
So how DID the edited video (of 24 years ago) get to go viral?

I seriously doubt millions of people read Andrew Breibart's blog.

" Conservative blogger Nadia Naffe accused OKeefe of sending her harassing messages after she backed out of an upcoming hidden camera sting on the  Occupy Wall Street  protest in New York City.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0085.6
Judge Alan Karch dismissed the criminal complaint against OKeefe because there was insufficient evidence showing the harassment originated in Westwood, where OKeefe lives with his parents.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889117_0085.7
Naffe also vaguely suggested that OKeefe drugged her, and that she passed out while OKeefe and a friend were taking her to the train station.

When she awoke, she allegedly found underwear and a wireless mouse had been stolen from her luggage, according to Harris report about the hearing."

ITS CALLED BULLSHIT and you rightly OUTED HIM

Honestly, I've never heard Paul call himself "the Reagan candidate".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889288_0017.3
The OP doesn't appear to have a link.

You have NEVER heard Paul call himself a FILP,FLOP either BUT HE IS...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889288_0019.1
Slimey bastard can lie about his past all he wants.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889288_0019.2
There are too many people who are not going to let Paul get away with the lies (like me!)

This is exactly what I told you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889288_0019.5
Paul left for the libertarian party and only returned to the Republican party when he discovered he couldn't win elections in the libertarian party.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889288_0019.6
NOW, Paul wants to claim HE's the "Reagan" candidate!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889288_0019.7
Both Gingrich and Paul have made this claim and both of them have a record of bad mouthing Reagan when they thought it advataged their political career.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889288_0019.8
Talking out of both sides of your mouth may work for liberals.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889288_0019.9
Conservatives (like me) have a much longer memory.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889288_0019.10
Reagan never blamed America, but had faith in America.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889288_0019.11
Paul has some serious explaining to do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889288_0020.7

I'm not saying you're wrong, but surely you have some evidence to back your assertion.

Oh noes!

If he gets the nomination, you close ranks and support him because he's the choice of Team Red, and literally Satan himself is better than anyone that could possibly be nominated by Team Blue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889288_0022.14
I mean, you wouldn't want someone to think you're not a party man...

What Party?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0015.1
You can't guarantee prosperity, some people have bad luck, or make unwise decisions that don't work out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0015.2
It's the way it's been since the beginning of time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0015.3
But if you work hard and do right, you will have a much better chance of being prosperous than you will by sticking your hand out to uncle Sam.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0015.4
I do feel we should look after those who truly need it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0015.5
That does not include chronic baby factories, or healthy individuals whose only ailment is lack of motivation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0015.6
I totally agree..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0015.7
However our politicians who allegedly represent us use tax dollars to buy votes - more specifically progressive politicians...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0015.8
Of course republicans have their own dirty too, however I recognize the difference between a RHINO and a real republican, libertarian or whatnot..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0015.9
I have absolutely no problem with our government helping the truly needy, however using tax dollars to entice a specific base to vote for you is wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0015.10
If you're 25 years old you should be working, you shouldn't have to depend on welfare to get you through life, however democrats have no problem handing money out to perfectly healthy 25-year-olds with 15 kids just as long as they vote democrat and of course if that 25-year-old wants to keep her benefits she better vote democrat..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0015.11
Our government is just dysfunctional...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0015.12
Or maybe your just dysfunctional.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0015.13
Its easy to label all that shit as liberal/progressive but its corporate liberalism that got us here.

We have been through this enough to know for a verifiable fact that your a dumbfuck.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0015.17
I just wanted to pop in and remind you of that today.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0016.19
I love how bitches with 4th grade educations are shitting kids and look to our government to support them..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0016.20
Of course in your LITTLE WORLD only the needy get fed...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0016.21
In my world there is epic welfare fraud, and I have seen it..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0016.22
Yeah minorities are proud to have 10 kids they can't support and they will CONTINUE to vote for Obama because activist organizations give them a free tote bag if they do..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889370_0016.23
Not only do they get free shit they're escorted to vote for the fucking democrats and told who to vote for...

His over-reliance on diplomacy with Republicans has been costly for critical progress.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0012.2
That being said, I do think he is a good president Let me explain why I didn't choose the other options:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0012.3
1) I think Obama shares the blame a little on the slow recovery of the economy, but I think there are many factors to be considered (i.e., congress)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0012.4
2) I think his foreign policy has been great
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0012.5
3) Despite Solyndra, his energy policy has been quite successful
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0012.6
4) It was Bush that supercharged the defict (although some of the blame does go to Obama, too)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0012.7
5) His taxation policy would have been great had it not been for what I chose out of this poll
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0012.8
6) National Security has undoubtedly been his best work (even Fox News can admit that).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0012.9
Please explain your choice.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0012.10
His foreign policy has been abysmal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0012.11
Today, thanks to Obama, we're leaving Iraq in shame.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0012.12
The troops are just glad to be leaving, but everyone knows Obama intentionally screwed the pooch there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0012.13
Nobody likes us.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0012.14
At one time everyone thought that Bush was hated, but Obama has taken hatred of America to a new level.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0012.15
It's time we got this childish OWS out of the White House and put somebody responsible back at the helm.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0013.16
You have absolutely no perspective whatsoever.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0013.17
For one thing, polls show most Americans (including most Republicans) agree that ending the war in Iraq was a good idea.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0013.18
No he hasnt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0013.19
He has never publically supported the OWS.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0014.1
He's been a weak leader who has divided this country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0014.2
He is like a liberal Bush.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.1
Who are you to talk?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.2
Can you come up with an objective approach?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.3
No, because you are too biased.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.4
Meaning I shouldn't talk ?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.5
Sorry, but you don't skate on this one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.6
And I certainly don't answer to you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.7
Any promise or objective can be set up correctly with measures.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.8
As to weight, that depends on your point of view.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.9
But, Politifact holds no sway if people don't agree to the measures to begin with.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.10
And this isn't about dissing Politifact.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.11
They are simply reporting.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.12
But they report raw numbers and to allow you to hold those up as being meaningful would be a mistake on our part.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.13
Do you want to support your statement that I am too biased.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.14
Or is this just a smokescreen because someone is calling you on your supposed "logical" approach.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.15
You calling it useless without giving good reason why or coming up with an alternate source of analysis on his promises, makes you biased.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.16
The raw data speaks for itself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.17
Obama has succeeded on most of his campaign promises.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.18
I don't need an alternative to show you methodology to be flawed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.19
And for someone who has critical thinker in his/her avatar, it is obvious you don't know what that means.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.20
And attempting to use it to prove bias is almost laughable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.21
Well, actually it is laughable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.25
There may not be a way to actually meaningfully measure his promises kept.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.26
Raw data, espcially in this case, would need to be processed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0037.27
Just looking at the numbers is meaningless.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.1
Creating 5 million jobs huh?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.2
Want to cite that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.3
And investing in green tech.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.4
He has not invested a dime in green tech.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.5
What he has invested in is companies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.6
Companies that are going to go with the status quo as long as they can sell it and are going to resist all efforts to push green tech any further than immediate profits.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.7
This is the problem that I have with government 'investment' in technology.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.8
That investment should begin and end with straight out research grants that are awarded to people that are purely in it to push the technology.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.9
Companies do not need incentive for R&D.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.10
they will do so as long as they can make a profit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.11
In that regard, no matter how much you give them, it will not change their R&D goals.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.12
On the other hand, the government must invest in technology because it is the ONLY entity that can invest billions pushing a tech to the next level and shrug the losses off.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.13
This is even more true in cases where no benefits are actually realized.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.14
See NASA for situations where government investment in technology has pushed the envelope.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.15
Investing in companies in the tech industry is NOT the place of government and does not end well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.16
Establishing an energy policy with Brazil does some good.

Until the BLS completes these surveys, the exact number of newly created green jobs is open to debate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.22
The Council of Economic Advisers -- which advises the president on economic matters --claims that 225,000 green jobs have been saved or created through the first nine months of 2010.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.23
Claims.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.24
Yes, THAT'S convincing verbiage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.25
As of yet, there is simply not enough data to accurately gauge the progress in green job growth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.26
Because of this, we continue to rate this promise as In the Works.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.27
225K is nowhere near a million.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.28
Even more so because it is essentially a guess.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.29
We also need to include the fact that the goal posts were moved from creating those jobs to now created OR saved.

Heap that on top of the fact that the numbers of created or saved jobs has essentially been a farce through the economic downturn and you have nothing on that claim whatsoever.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.31
True, I was quoting Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.32
However, I bet his estimate will come close.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.33
We will have to wait and see.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.34
We are running out of the fuels we have.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.35
We need to invest in alternate forms of energy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.36
Is gov involvement the best way to go?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.37
No, but it's a start.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0038.38
Energy companies arent going to do it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0039.25
I never said it was perfect.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0039.26
I just challenged you to come up with something better.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0039.27
For now, it is best source we have.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0057.10
I picked the economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0057.11
I picked it because instead of using his political capital at the beginning of his presidency to adress jobs, unemployment, the budget defecit, and the national debt he used up all that capital getting Obamacare passed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0057.12
The double whammy is Obamacare has actually, unlike it was intended to according to those who supported it, hurt the economy and the national debt along with cutting medicare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0058.1
If Obama had been even more antipathetic to Republicans than he already was, the backlash from the people would have been even stronger than the profound levels it reached in 2010.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0058.2
Obama's version of bipartisanship is like an abusive parent offering their child candy while slapping them in the face.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0058.3
It was a recipe for schizophrenic government, which is what we have now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0058.4
Obama is a failed leader.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0058.5
The bias of your poll, Billy, was obvious.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0058.6
When I saw your longest entry, I guessed what your choice was without you explaining it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0058.7
Anyone claiming obama hasn't been partisan toward conservatives and republicans is either blind or a far left liberal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0059.13
I also picked the economy, for more or less those reasons.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0059.14
If Obama had paid more attention to how the stimulus was used and to making HAMP work as he said it would, then the recovery could have been much more robust.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0059.15
What would have happened if Obama had taken his supposed zeal for infrastructure and actually put some effort into backing that in 2009?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0059.16
Instead he neutralized most of the positive effect the stimulus and his other programs could have had by spending all that time on Obamacare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0059.17
It has been a raincloud over the economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.1
It's not a failure so much as a deception.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.2
Obama campaigned in 2008 as a progressive, and the people who voted him into office believed that's what he was.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.3
I remember being thrilled at how many small donations he was receiving, and thinking naively that maybe this was a way around corporate dominance of the government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.4
Boy, was I wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.5
Down the list, almost every "failure" of the Obama administration can be seen instead to be deliberate policy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.6
For example, Obama is believed by some to have shown weak leadership on health-care reform, letting Congress craft the bill for him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.7
But when it looked like no reform was going to pass, he demonstrated that he had the ability to twist arms and guide the process to what he wanted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.8
So what does that mean?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.9
It means that he let it go as long as it was going the way he wanted, and took an active role when it looked like it wasn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.10
He wasn't "weak" on this: he was corrupt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.11
He got a health-care reform bill that his campaign contributors, who included health-insurance companies in large amounts, could be happy with.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.12
Obama is the reason we don't have a public option.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.13
If he'd intended there to be one, we would have one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.14
Look at who he appointed to key economic positions in his Cabinet: Wall Street cronies and tools, architects of center-right corporate-friendly economic policy, Clinton-era DLC retreads.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.15
The Republicans did not pressure him into appointing Geithner as Treasury Secretary, nor did he need their approval to do so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.16
He did that on his own initiative.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.17
Barack Obama is simply not the progressive friend of the people that he claimed to be in 2008.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.18
And THAT is his biggest failing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.19
Bingo.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.20
As I said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889674_0060.21
Running for POTUS is a whole hell of a lot easier that being POTUS.Especially when you don't have the skills for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0017.1
These same people didn't seem to have a problem when there was a campaign going on to pull ads from the Glen Beck show.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0017.2
Go to Lowes and shop folks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0017.3
It's still a free country and I don't care what their reason are for pulling their ads.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0017.4
It's no ones business.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0017.5
wow...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0017.6
I don't remember a "campaign" of any sort...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0017.7
I think Beck dug his own grave with his false version of Christianity and his outlandish nature.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0017.8
There was a concentrated effort on the part of the left, led by Media Matters, to get advertisers to pull their ads from Beck's show.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0017.9
Which I personally have no problem with.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0017.10
Beck is a horrible human being.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0018.1
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/11/showbiz/all-american-muslim-lowes/index.html">Lowe's pulls advertising from TLC's 'All-American Muslim' - CNN.com</a>
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0018.2
Lowes pulled an ad they had placed on All-American Muslim essentially claiming that the show was to controversial.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0018.3
Now they are getting a lot of flack claiming that they are upholding an anti Muslim bigoted attitude.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0018.4
As I understand it, the show is based around AMERICAN Muslims and the struggles they are facing in a post 9/11 America.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0018.5
While I have no issues with how Lowes decides to advertise, this does seem like a bone headed move particularly considering that I would have never even known about the show in the first place until Lowes created this controversy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0018.6
Many people are now calling Lowes Bigoted for this move.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0018.7
Your thoughts?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0018.8
They are free to do this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0018.9
And they shouldn't complain or ask for federal aid when they experience a backlash.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0018.11
Elaborate, please.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0019.10
huh..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0019.12
You've turned into a regular little fascist
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0020.5
I completely agree with both points.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0020.6
However, I personally would not have pulled the ad's unless the ratings were lower than I wanted them to be for a time slot my commercial would air.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0020.7
Why??
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0020.8
I would have pulled the ads just because the show was horse shit and a mockery of our freedom, hence no one wanted to watch it..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0020.9
Quite frankly I would have never advertised with the program to begin with...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0020.10
The whole concept was an oxymoron from the start..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0021.10
Not that they will, but why should federal aid be linked to whether a company is "politically correct" or not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0021.11
There's only one good reason why a company should get a bailout, and that's if the consequences of its sudden collapse would be more economically disasterous than just letting the market take its course, and if it has a reasonable change of viability after the bailout in order to pay the money back.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0022.10
Federal backlash???
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0022.11
What the fuck does that mean Stalin??
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0022.12
Do you expect Obama to sue Lowes???
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0022.13
hahahaha
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0022.14
You're one dumb motherfucker...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0022.15
Thanks for showing how authoritarian progressives are...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0040.1
The show is just propiganda.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0040.2
They want to show us how Muslims are misunderstood victims.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0040.3
Next time i need to shop for some tools, fuck home depot, i'm going to lowes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0040.4
IMO, Lowes is way better anyways, I appreciate their position but they have what I need all the time unlike Home Depot...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0040.5
Sometimes they both suck...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0040.6
lol.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0040.7
I needed a spotlight fixture for my Christmas lights (just the holder on a spike).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0040.8
Lowes was out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0040.9
Home Depot was out.

The little mom & pop True Value a block from my house that I never shop at had about a hundred in stock.

Sure, they were $3.00 more than the others would have been...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0040.15
but they HAD them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0041.8
I'm certain the entire hypocritical land of left wing lunatics will label Lowe's bigoted and are even threatening a boycott.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0041.9
This is a free country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0041.10
Lowe's should be able to spend their advertising dollars when and where they want to without being accused of bigotry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0041.11
I'll continue to make it my store of choice when I need home improvement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0042.12
C'mon, how many of the progressives that are outraged over this do you think can even swing a hammer?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0042.13
Or have the ambition too?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0043.14
good point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0044.14
Very comical to watch.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0045.3
Interesting to see how many conservatives think Lowes only carries hammers...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0045.4
(BTW, this progressive helped build the house I live in and the house my parents live in...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0045.5
but don't let that keep you from making idiotic comments like the one above for Willow to froth over
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0046.9
However, I have already heard one radio ditto head (Pete Dominick) call for a boycot so they are already on that train....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0047.8
Hey, I've met the odd progressive who doesn't swing a hammer like the obama throws a baseball, just not too many.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0048.1
There's an "All American Muslim" show?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0048.2
I didn't know that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0048.3
I'm German - how about an "All American Kraut" series for us?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0048.4
Didn't you watch "Hogan's Heros" as a kid?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0049.8
With almost 30 years in the business, there is much truth to his statement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0049.9
Every stereotype has exceptions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0050.1
They have a right to spend their money where they set fit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0051.2
They do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.8
If they pulled it because they didn't like the subject matter of the show, that's kind of wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.9
I mean, this is the network that gave us the Jon and Kate and the shows about the midgets, which is a lot more obnoxious than a show about Muslims.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.10
If they pulled the ads because no one was watching the show, then it's a sensible business decision.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.11
As far as I can tell, ratings had nothing to do with it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.12
It was centered solely on the fact that the subject matter was Muslims and they were getting a lot of feedback with strong opinions on the subject matter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.13
Go figure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.14
As I said, it was a dumb move on their part as no one would have ever found out about the ads other than those that watch the show.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.15
They obviously do not care about the controversy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.16
Now many people are pissed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.17
Not sure if I care at all myself but I did want to see some opinions/discussions of the people here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.18
Many are calling it a racist move but I don't think that a company of that scope makes decisions on this scale with a racist intent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.19
They have far too much money on the line.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.20
It seems they did not think it through though.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.21
What part of this are you having trouble understanding?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.22
"Lowe's has received a significant amount of communication on this program, from every perspective possible.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.23
Individuals and groups have strong political and societal views on this topic, and this program became a lightning rod for many of those views.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0052.24
As a result we did pull our advertising on this program," the company said in a statement Saturday.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0053.19
None.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0053.20
Where have I stated anything that would lead you to believe I do not understand their statement?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0054.16
I don't have a Lowe's near me but Home Depot does suck.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0054.17
I went in to buy some half inch by six lag bolts and they had none, I mean none at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0054.18
Those lags are one of the staples of construction and are required by code and there were none.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0054.19
I went in yesterday and they were out of 15 amp circuit breakers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0054.20
I am hoping a Lowe's will be built nearby.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0055.1
It appears Kayak.com also pulled their ads, but they cited the poor quality of the show.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0056.4
Great point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889727_0056.5
Especially since being a Muslim is a nationality just like being German.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0019.1

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0019.12
the first president to ever do so is President Obama (D) and he did so with obamacare.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0019.13
makes me laugh at the meme "republicans hate the elderly".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0019.14
No.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0019.15
Obama did not cut Medicare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0019.16
The cuts dont come from the current Medicare budget, they put a leash on future growth and payment increases.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0020.1
The same way Bush payed for his tax cuts for the wealthy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.1
Congress always seems to be intent on "paying for a tax cut".....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.3
We're not hearing much about it.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.4
but it appears that one way to "pay for" the payroll tax cut will be to increase the cost of mortgages....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.5
more sneaky fees....

First, I think that the payroll tax cut is a bad idea.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.9
I understand the desire to get more money into the hands of people that will circulate it in the economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.10
However, a tax cut that means less money in the SS funds is hardly a wise move.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.11
In fact, what we need to do, is immediatly restore the tax structure we had under Clinton.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.12
Then add another 5% for those making over 1 million a year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.13
Cap the FICA taxes at $500,000, and make is on all income.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.14
Then start to rebuild our grid, to make it both a truly national grid, and to make it less vulneable to natural and manmade disasters.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.15
Pay for it the same way we have paid for the Interstate Highway System.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.16
Water systems in this nation are not only in major jeopardy for many our our metropolitan areas, but many of the existings systems lose nearly as much water as they deliver.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.17
Water is one of the key three things needed for survival, we are already seeing the some cities reusing sewage water.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.18
Time to go to work on that, also.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.19
Kill the F-35 weopons systems, only spend as much on defense as the next 7 nations combined, and the infrastructure improvement become doable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.20
we've had the payroll tax "holiday" for a year now and it has not helped the economy in any significant way....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.21
another leftie failure to fix....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.22
when is the left going to agree to a pro-growth tax structure to bring jobs back..?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.23
taxing the rich isn't going to cut it...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0021.24
agree with you about the water systems and our grids.....

disasters in the making....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0022.12

BO just stole from Peter to pay Paul.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0022.14
Paul is Obamacare....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8889769_0023.12
Actually Obamacare, pushed by the democrats and obama himself, cuts half a trillion from medicare over the next 9 years (the study will say ten years but a year has passed already

Agreed.

In fact, one of my disappointments is that he has not been liberal enough!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0021.3
Specifically, a larger stimulus was needed and a public option should not have been taken off the table.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0021.4
He had no choice and he didn't give a fuck.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0021.5
What makes me laugh is that you guys (and by 'you guys' I mean all those who haven't worked the truth out yet)....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0021.6
is that you keep falling for the bullshit.

heh heh cute.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0021.8
But please, run along.

I laugh at your stupidity quite often.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0022.8
And somehow I am not offended
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0022.9
Good.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0022.10
The truth should never offend.

There's a lot of bullshit that needs removing.

You don't go after banks corporations too much in a bad recession.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0024.2
I haven't seen any plausible ways suggested to get them to stop hoarding.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0024.3
Any public option would have lost us blue dogs and the whole ACA.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0024.4
COULDN'T get anymore.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0024.5
I believe he could have seized the major banks and nationalized them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0024.6
Then forced them to lend the money given them by Bush, and also force them to rewrite loans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0024.7
That certainly would have helped get the country going again and was being called for by some of the more far left liberals.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0024.8
I didn't mean to suggest a Public Option would have made it all the way through, but Obama dropped it quicker than he dropped smoking.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0024.9
That never made sense to me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0025.1
And to what extent?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0025.2
I think Obama has undeniably accomplished a lot in his first 3 years, but his over-reliance on diplomacy with Republicans has impeded critical progress.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0025.3
I'm sure the cons/repubs on here are undoubtedly going to answer this question too, but at least try and be mature about it...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0025.4
*plays flute to summon the small band of lefties out of the woodwork*
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0025.5
"diplomacy with the Republicans"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0025.6
you gotta be fucking on something..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0026.1
My biggest disappointment with Obama is that, in negotiations, he tends to give too much to the GOP in hopes that they'll be fair and willing partners in governance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0026.2
I realize that he's trying to appeal to the middle, but at some point he's got to say enough is enough (which he SEEMS to be doing now - we'll see).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0026.3
If he didn't already know it, he should know by now that the GOP is not the least bit interested in compromise.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0026.4
I agree.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0027.5
You got it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0027.6
That's the only issue I had.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0027.7
His willingness to compromise didn't fly because of their 'make him a one term president' agenda.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0027.8
He then should have came out guns blazing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0028.9
You are on something, another planet.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0029.9
how many Republicans should he have killed doyathink?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0030.10
Three.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0031.10
Are you as disappointed as I am with the violent rhetoric from the left?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0076.4
You mean like Obamacare?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0076.5
Give some examples of this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0076.6
It just shows how looney left you are.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0076.7
Obama is the most divisive bitterly partisan President in my lifetime, and that's up against some pretty stiff competition.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0076.8
Really?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0076.9
How old are you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0076.10
I'd have to say Nixon was the most divisive one I've ever lived through.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0076.11
Do you have some examples of how bitterly divisive Obama has been?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0077.2
Actually, the fact that you think Obama, who is quite conservative in his governance as Democrats go, is some kind of extreme left-wing ideologue, shows how looney right YOU are.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0078.12
Nice diversion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0078.13
Try answering the question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0080.12
I agree.

Either Kaz thinks George W. Bush is a centrist, or Kaz is a child.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0080.14
I wonder which it is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0081.1
I'm a socialist.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0081.2
He is a liar.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0082.1
By backing down on the Public Option.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0082.2
You talk like he could have passed a public option Bill.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0082.3
He didn't have the votes from his own party for that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0082.4
He had to bribe to get the Bill passed that he has.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0083.5
Obama should have invoked the 14th Amendment during the made-up debt crisis created by the Teapubs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0083.6
He should have kept the Public Option on the table too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0083.7
The Dems need to stop compromising when it's clear the other side has no intention of doing so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0083.8
He'd better not compromise and give in to the pipeline if the Repubs attach it to the payroll tax cuts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0083.9
I've been pretty pleased with Obama on the whole but if he caves on that one too, damn I'm gonna be pissed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0083.10
Yeah!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0083.11
it would be a fucking shame to put 20 thousand Americans to work and to find a source that isn't Arab..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0083.12
we got it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0083.13
we fucking got it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0083.14
asswipe.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0083.15
In this case, you mean Canada's got it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0083.16
Yeah, it would be a shame to spend all that time and money investing in a filthy, polluting energy source instead of spending time and money on cleaner, cheaper alternatives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0083.17
Funny how the House Repubs are fired up all of sudden about jobs when they haven't given a shit about jobs since they took the majority.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0084.14
Nice fairy tale, yours?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0085.10
I absolutely agree with you on the 14th Amendment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0085.11
Of course, the TPers claim Obama took total control of all medical care in the country, so I'm sure it doesn't take much imagination to know what they would claim if he had gone the 14th Amendment route.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0085.12
Still, would have been nice to see.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0085.13
I see him compromising on the pipeline just like he did with the tax cuts for the wealthy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0085.14
The GOP has proven they will destroy families in order to get what they want.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0085.15
Obama really has no choice.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0085.16
They sure have.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0085.17
Reid declared the bill DOA anyway so hopefully he won't give Obama a chance to cave.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0085.18
If the payroll tax goes back up 2% to it's original amount, it would suck but it wouldn't be the end of the world to me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0085.19
Let the GOP Obstructionists play their game.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0085.20
If it's going to hit them in their wallets, they'll eventually scramble and draw up a clean bill.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0086.17
So you support the continued fleecing and bankrupting of SS.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0086.18
The cut has been ineffective., But as long as you get some welfare its good right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0087.14
Ineffective?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0087.15
First off, I thought conservatives believed any and all tax cuts are good.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0087.16
They always create jobs, always.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0087.17
Second, we've had private sector job growth every month since the cut was in place.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0087.18
What world do you live in?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0088.13
There's a switch, huh?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0088.14
A conservative in favor of letting taxes increase....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0088.15
to fund SS no less.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0089.13
You thought?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0089.14
Damn, I missed it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0089.15
My bad.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0090.1
What you already said...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0090.3
is the biggest reason for me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0090.4
He and his admin.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0090.5
have also shown they're not much better than the Repubs when it comes to the big banks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0090.6
Yes, and what I find so bizarre about it is that Repubs are constantly trying to paint him as this liberal extremist.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0090.7
I mean that charge is just so patently false.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0090.11
trillions of the stimulus was given to banks overseas !!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0090.12
yeah lets give em trillions more !!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0090.13
libbs are idiots !!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0091.9
heh heh you think the stimulus was trillions?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0091.10
I think you have some reading to do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0092.9
I think he's got a few years of grammar school to make up first.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0098.10
What makes you think that a US President has the right to seize banks and nationalize them?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0098.11
The reason that the US has always attracted foreign investment is that we are a nation of laws in which the owners of private companies are protected from arbitrary "seizures" of their assets by the government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0098.12
Do you not grasp that this is what makes us different than so many other places in the world?

As for "forcing" banks to make loans?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0098.14
Have you so quickly forgotten that doing THAT was what got us into trouble with the housing bubble that just burst?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0098.15
It used to be that banks looked for 20% down on a house and one had to PROVE credit worthiness.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0098.16
That all changed when government intervened in the process and forced banks to make loans to people that didn't qualify under previous standards.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0098.17
"Forcing" banks into making bad loans was bad policy before and it remains so now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0098.18
That's the really frightening part!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0098.19
That they think that way.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0098.20

My biggest disappointment is that he seems to think he is above politics.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0099.2
He thinks he can stay out of the infighting and come in at the last minute and resolve everything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0099.3
He has an idealistic view that if he is reasonable, the other side will be reasonable too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0099.4
The result is that he is the only person in the room compromising
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0099.5
The result was an unfocused Stimulus bill trying to please everyone.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0099.6
He gave up the Government Option on healthcare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0099.7
He extended the Bush tax cuts and offered spending cuts without corresponding revenue increases
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890103_0099.8
On the bright side, it seems he has learned his lesson and realizes the other side is not playing by the same rules

He wasn't hiding it.

People noticed that he was SAYING more and more radical things.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890510_0030.8
Because he was muslim, everyone was too afraid to say anything for fear they would be identified as being somehow anti muslim.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890510_0030.9
We should never be afraid to be intimidated by religion to say that a muslim is a dangerous lunatic.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0077.13
Even the rules of what constitutes income are complicated.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0077.14
Our current tax code is the product of some social engineering, some legitimate means to fund the government, and a whole bunch of corruption in the process.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0079.14

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0091.4
Our system taxes dollars in that...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0091.5
it doesn't care who earns the money, but if anyone earns x dollars, they are paying a certain percentage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0091.6
If you earn more one year, and less the next year, the amount you pay will change because the rate is attached to the dollars, not the person.

If the rate was attached to the person, you could earn a million dollars this year, pay X percentage of taxes and next year lets say you lose your job, go broke and make nothing, you would still be paying the same amount because the rate is attached to you, not the dollars.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0091.8
That's not how our system is, thankfully.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0091.9
All you're saying is that an income tax is not a capitation tax.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0091.10
No duh?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0091.11
Thanks for providing no useful information to the discussion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0091.12
You still haven't explained why it's just for one person to pay a higher rate on his income than another.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0091.13
I could conceive of a tax that was graduated according to the amount of melanin in your skin.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0091.14
You might claim it discriminates against black people, but using your logic I would just say that it doesn't tax black people, but the melanin in your skin.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0091.15
Of course taxes come out of someones pocket, that's not at all what I was referring to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0091.16
Whether you agree with this or not, I hope this makes sense now, but I'm not holding my breath.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0091.17
It only makes sense to people who have had a lobotomy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0092.1
I grasp exactly what you meant, that's why I said it was idiotic.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0092.2
There are no taxes that people don't pay.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0092.3
They all come out of someone's pocket.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0092.4
You said our system "taxes dollars, not people."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0092.5
What part didn't I understand?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0092.16
Yet the left doesn't talk about taxing the dollar.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0092.17
They talk about taxing those evil, greedy, rich, 1% bastards who are stealing wealth from the average American paying their "fair share".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0092.18
You know, the 1% who pay 43% of federal taxes while 47% of the remaining 99% pay nothing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0092.19
Actually they do...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0092.20
the plans call for taxing incomes of over 1 million dollars, not specific people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0092.21
The legislation never says we want to tax, Bill Gates or Ruport Murdoch, etc, specifically.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0093.16
I'm glad you understand now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0093.17
I expected you to insult me once you finally understood what I mean, so thanks for that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0093.18
I tried to discuss with you before about why a flat tax would hurt the lowest earners but you ignored my question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0093.19
Did you not understand that one either?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0093.20
I really can't hold your hand through every post here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0093.21
At some point, you're going to have to figure these things out on your own.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0094.13
I agree on the clean up but I disagree on your reason.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0094.14
The tax code ought to be used to properly fund government operations as determined by the voters in this country, not to regulate income.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0095.22
You don't like being insulted, but you never fail to use that condescending tone whenever you disagree with someone.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0095.23
That's why I seldom treat leftists with respect: they are all such colossal hypocrites.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0095.24
WE were discussing how it's just for one person to pay a higher rate on his income than another, not whether a flat tax hurts low wage earners.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0095.25
However, one consideration you continually ignore is that every flat tax proposal exempts income up to a certain point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0095.26
Normally that point is well above the poverty line, so none of that actual flat tax proposals would hurt low wage earners.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0095.27
That would still not be paying any additional tax.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0096.5
Tax shelters are a thing of the past.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0096.6
Tax deductions for children help everyone · Write off of mortgage interest help the less wealthy afford homes....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0096.7
and are invariably offset by the real estate taxes they have to pay · Tax deferred investments are income that are ultimately taxed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0096.8
I am curious what loopholes exist that you are referring to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0096.9
The major one I was referring to is capital gains and the fact that its taxed at a lower rate than income.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0096.10
Only at the personal level, not the corporate level.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0096.11
Capital gains plus corporate income tax is actually quite high.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0097.18
That's not true.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0097.19
The rate is attached to the activity, not the dollar.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0097.20
Hence GE paid zero in corporate taxes but I paid taxes in years where I lost money.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0097.21
That's the problem with using the tax code to execute social engineering.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0097.22
It underfunds the government and does nothing to help those worst off.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0098.2
But that is not a loophole...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0098.3
it is a separate tax altogether and is really a tax on "unearned" income in theory..........
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0098.4
and it is available to anyone...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0098.5
whether they are incested in one share of IBM or a million shares of Microsoft.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0098.6
It's a loophole in that many of the wealthy derive their income in this manner, it's why Warren Buffet is able to have a lower overall tax rate than his secretary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0098.7
Buffett pays a lower rate than his secretary because he can afford to manipulate his income.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0098.8
If you removed the "loophole" as you call it he would just use some other means to accomplish the same end.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0098.9
Also, it's not necessarily bad that he pays a 17% rate on his personal income.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0098.10
If that rate doubled would he continue the same economic activity?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0098.11
Would the government receive more funding as a result?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0099.17
The Alternative Minimum Tax started out as a "millionaires tax."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0099.18
How has that worked out?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0100.18
Your buddy DiamondDave wouldn't have any exemption at all, even for people at or below poverty.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0100.19
It was he who I was talking to originally, when you decided to butt in.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0101.3
Yep I think people should be taxed based on their income level.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0101.4
Who ever says taxes need to conform with the ideals of equality?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0101.5
I think men should be paid more based on having a dick.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0101.6
See how that works?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0101.7
Well at least you're not claiming that everyone is equal in that department.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0101.9
So that means if you have a dick you pay more in taxes too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0102.14
asterism has explained it very well but I would add...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0102.15
People still seem to think this is about INCOME tax.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0102.16
Its not.

Never has been.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0102.18
Ultimate loophole of all time is that WEALTH is taxed at a much lower rate than income.

I think you may not get it.

Wealth is not taxed at all.

Wealth is the net after taxes

Income is taxed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0103.20
The ultra wealthy dont hide wealth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0103.21
They may hide income, and that is against the law......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0103.22
, but they do not gain anything if they hide wealth as one is not taxed on wealth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0120.1
And if I said I wanted to tax aerospace companies in Washington state that gross over $10 billion a year, that wouldn't be the same thing as creating a tax on Boeing Aerospace, would it?

Not if Boeing opts to make pencil erasers instead....

I believe THAT is the point RDD is making.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0120.5
The tax wouldnt be on Boeing...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0120.6
it would be on any company that fits the criteria.

Don't be stupid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0120.8
Of course it's a tax on Beoing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0120.9
A federal court ruled exactly that when the state of Washington tried to impose exactly such a tax.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0120.10
That's like saying I don't have to pay income tax if I want to starve in some cave.

You're the one who doesn't get it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0121.4
The fact that you use some criteria to identify people to tax other than identifying them by name doesn't mean you aren't discriminating against them by name.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0121.5
I already posted you an example that proves my point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0122.1
You're mad, aren't you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0122.2
So, the left wants to redistribute wealth with taxation and that isn't an attempt to legislate some equality in wealth, right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0122.3
Not mad at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0122.4

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.45
Where?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.46
Sure, things are tight right now.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.47
but you see an ever growing homeless situation happening?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.48
How many people do you hear about starving to death????
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.49
their families fed and pay their monthly utilities, then you see reports on how the rich keep hauling money in at a record pace...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.50
well, if you can't see the fucked up nature of that...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.51
all talking points..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.52
and it is making you sound foolish then you are too indoctrinated to even debate with.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.53
Finally...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.54
the left's excuse for "denying what they are"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.55
What...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.56
are you going to throw the "M" word out?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.57
I am not a fuckin' Marxist...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.58
that's more of your brainwashed propaganda against the vast majority of our population...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.59
you know...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.60
the people who do the wealthy's dirty work and get shit on at every turn?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.61
wow...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.62
an entire post of talking points.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0128.63
They got ya hooked.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0129.12
You are aware that "wealth" as opposed to income has already been taxed when it WAS income, correct?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0129.13
The US can not operate a nice welfare/warfare state state with that attitude!!!!!!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0130.1
I disagree.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0130.2
Taxes can be entirely fair by assessing the same user fee to everybody who uses a service or product or government program.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0130.3
If we go the income route, a tax can be entirely fair by assessing the same proportional percentage to ALL income regardless of socioeconomic standing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0130.4
The only way taxes will be 'fair' is when they are not used to control, discipline, or manipulate people and/or the economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0130.5
Taxes should be collected to run the NECESSARY functions of government and for nothing else.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.28
You even want MORE of the same...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.30
You applaud every time the jobs go overseas....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.32
You applaud the gross tax evasion that those same entities are allowed to commit because "they are just trying to keep what is theirs".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.38
I don't give a flying fuck how much other people have...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.39
but when a vast number of the people in this country can barely afford to keep a roof over their heads, their families fed and pay their monthly utilities, then you see reports on how the rich keep hauling money in at a record pace...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.41
then you are too indoctrinated to even debate with.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.50
Really?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.51
Care to back up your "vast number"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.52
From where I sit, the vast number of people aren't holed up in some shanty eating shoe leather.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.53
I'm in a city with over a million people in the greater metro area.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.54
The Occupy folks are camped out a block from my downtown office.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.55
The most I've ever seen at one time is about a dozen people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.56
You'd think that if the "vast number" are as poor off as you would have us believe, they'd be swelling the ranks of the folks championing them, but they aren't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.57
Why?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.58
They are at work putting a roof over their family's head and living life.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0134.59
Look, you want to talk about fucked up, propaganda and indoctrination, you need to can that class warfare bullshit like, "the people who do the wealthy's dirty work and get shit on at every turn" if YOU want to be taken seriously.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0135.6
Not some criteria....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0135.7
Income.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0135.8
Nothing more, nothing less.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0135.9
Does it really matter whether you name them by individual name or simply by demographic?

There just are not enough left handed guys named 'Doug' to cause much of a ruckus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0136.2
Tax them at 100%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0139.57
Bull fuckin' shit.

you know..

and guess what?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0139.63
Odds are you still aren't going to be able to raise a family on it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0139.64
and before you even start...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0139.65
there are a hell of a lot of people out there that will never be anything more than a menial labor kind of worker.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0139.66
Your problem is...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0139.67
you seem to think that they don't deserve a decent life in this country because they may not have the brains to get educated or the business savvy to run their own.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0139.68
You are an elitist who only cares about the elite.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0139.69
and the only reason you are so infatuated with such a SMALL number of employees(unionized) is that the idiots on the radio tell you to be.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0139.70
You have not a fucking clue...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0139.71
not one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0139.72
oh I know...

next you'll be telling me how you either worked with, or was a Union member at one time and they were all jackoffs...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0139.74
that's just message board fodder because no one can prove it...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0139.75
so I don't believe it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0140.7
It doesn't matter whether it's income or the color of their skin, it's still discrimination.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0140.8
What if the government placed a tax on people who couldn't speak English?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0140.9
All you leftist turds would be howling about that, wouldn't you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0140.10
Yet, to avoid it, all you have to do is learn English.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0140.11
How is that any different in nature than a graduated income tax?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0140.12
Because thats basing a tax on something arbitrary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0140.13
What I'm talking about is basing tax solely on dollars earned.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0140.14
Holy fuck you're an idiot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0140.15
Serious question, whats the highest level of education you completed?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0140.16
And what do you do for a living?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.1
I hear a lot these days about asking people and companies to pay their fair share in taxes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.2
While Im not sure what a fair share is (it seems that everyone believes they are paying a fair share or more of their own income already), I wonder if that should be the deciding factor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.3
Should tax policy be fair, or should it focus more on what is best for the country?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.4
We have a determinable tax base from which to draw these revenues, so lets assume that expected revenue, without difficult to support GDP changes based upon certain plans, remains the same.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.5
How would you divide the taxpaying pie between the various income levels?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.6
We could conclude that it was the most beneficial to reduce the levels paid by the lower income levels, in order to spur consumption.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.7
Lower income households would tend to immediately spend those additional dollars on things they either want or need.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.8
Of course, since many of the products that are purchased by this group are made in China, it may not spur our economy to the extent you would think, and it would most certainly reduce the countrys saving rate and dollars available for investment, but there is a case to be made that it would increase economic activity, at least in the short term.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.9
If instead you reduce the levels paid by the upper income levels, those additional dollars will likely not be immediately spent, but invested in (hopefully) some productive endeavor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.10
Again, some (probably fairly sizeable) percentage of those funds would also find their way to China as investments in plant or equipment, or in purchases of business assets.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.11
However, the savings rate of the country and the total pool of private capital would increase, theoretically spurring business investment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.12
Setting aside what is fair, which do you think provides the best chance for long-term growth and prosperity?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.13
Is there an optimum level where consumers have enough to spend and the pool of capital is adequate?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.14
Government has no business being anything other than Impartial.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.15
Either it establishes and serves Justice or it is at war with Justice.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0146.16
Can't have it both ways.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.1
LOL.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.2
Yeah you're tearing my argument to pieces.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.3
A fellow conservative even tried to explain this to you and asked why you can't grasp this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.4
Not every conservative has a firm grasp on every issue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.5
Conservatives in this forum post all kinds of stuff that is just plain wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.6
That's because they were all educated by communist indoctrinators.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.7
They mistakenly believe some of the swill they were spoon-fed in government schools.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.8
I ask about your schooling and job because I need to know if I'm actually dealing with someone who has the capability enough to use his brain to hold a job or achieve some sort of degree.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.9
I have serious doubts at this point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.10
No, you're simply a leftwing jackass who is losing the argument.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.11
You haven't really thought about the stuff you believe in, so it's easy for someone who has to tear you apart.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.12
You aren't fooling anyone by attacking my schooling or my mental capabilities.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.13
Anyone with a brain can see who is losing this exchange.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.14
I didn't attack your education or job.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.15
I just inquired about it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.16
Learn the difference...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.17
oh thats right, you can't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.18
I'm going to cut my losses and learn that talking to you is like explaining things to someone with severe autism and a severe delusions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.19
I'm sorry you're embarrassed by your lack of education and job.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0147.20
It does explain a lot about you though.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890653_0148.14
The Constitution seems to say it should.

BTW, your avatar just cracks me up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.2
Really nails Ron Paul.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.3
He tries to be the real thing but he's a fake.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.4
And, his darling little boy proves that the crumbs don't fall far from the fruitcake.

I'd give a lot for a real Libertarian to run but Paul and his nasty little plutocrat son ain't it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.6
I knew Dave Nolan back in the 70s.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.7
I had worked with Dick Lamm who was registered Dem but who was really a closet Libertarian.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.8
I'm afraid real Libertarians are long gone now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.9
Nah,you're wrong about Dr. Paul.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.10
You can insult me all you want.

But you don't know anything about Ron Paul.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.17
You and Wall Street.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.18
So why are you so angry with them?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.19
You really aren't any different.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.20

Anyone who would post THAT avatar doesn't think much of Ron Paul and I was insulting him and his posing as a Libertarian.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.23
Second, you don't have a friggin clue about "entitlements" v. Wall Street.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.24
Did you even think this through before you said those two are the same or even related?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.25
Entitlements are earned by real people who work for many years for real companies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.26
The Wall Street mess was caused by just the opposite.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.27
Why don't you know that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.28
do you have parents who get Social Security?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.29
Talk to them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.30
If you were a Libertarian, you would be very angry with Wall Street.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.31
Now I see that you're just a kid who thinks a president with a light saber would be cool or some such silliness.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.32
Well, good luck with that and be sure to vote for Paul.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.34

You both have an Entitlement attitude.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.41
I think you both need to stop demanding handouts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.42
We're broke for God's sake.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0030.43
Enough is enough.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0031.1
Why do some of you keep saying that Wall Street fat cats are the same as the working class who pay into their entitlements and then want to draw on them when they retire?

What makes you think Wall Street is "stealing" from fellow citizens?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0033.36
Jeez.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0033.37
You just make it up as you go along, don't you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0033.38
I'm not "IN" the OWS movement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0033.39
I've never demanded or gotten a handout.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0033.40
I've worked for everything I have, I'm comfortable and no, you can't have it to give to the 1%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0033.41
And, if you think "we're broke", you haven't been paying attention.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0033.42
Educate yourself and stop thinking that Ron Paul is going to save you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0034.2
Then why are they protesting?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0034.3
They can still do that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0034.4
That hasn't changed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0034.5
They just want their Taxpayer Freebies just like Wall Street does.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0034.6
It is 'Generation Gimme.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0034.7
' But we just can't afford them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.1
No it's just that people like you can't be honest.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.2
It is all about demanding those Taxpayer Freebies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.3
Doesn't matter to me you wont admit that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.4
But it is reality.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.5
Take a closer look at their signs and listen to what OWS is really saying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.6
It is all about the Entitlements.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.7
They have their hands out and so does Wall Street.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.8
And they're not even occupying the right places anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.9
They should be in Washington because that's where all the real problems are.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.10
OWS and Wall Street are just in competition with each other for their handouts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.11
They stand for the same basic Entitlement philosophy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.12
Question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.13
You truly believe that the people who have lost their entire LIFE in this economic meltdown by-way of foreclosure, as a direct result of the real sense of ENTITLEMENT and irresponsibility of investors, are in fact similarly motivated?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.14
I think there is a broader view of holding people accountable that your conveniently ignore with your argument.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.15
AIG gets bailed out, then gives multi-million dollar bonuses in the very same year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.16
That's entitlement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.17
Average American has his house foreclosed on by the very banks he is paying to bail out, and wants answers and recompense.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.18
Entitlement or accountability and justice?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.19
Common sense tells us that bankers that have to sell their third vacation home are the one's with entitlement issues.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.20
Not the people that want them to pay their share of the tax burden which they very much are responsible for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.21
Why did they lose their entire life?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.22
And why is that other Taxpayers' fault.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.23
You don't get to demand stealing from fellow Citizens just because your life didn't turn out the way you wanted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.24
That's the same exact mentality Wall Street has.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.25
If your problem is with the Banks,then sue the banks and try to get some money out of them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.26
I have no problem with that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.27
But your real problem is still with Washington.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.28
They gave Wall Street all that Taxpayer cash.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.29
You guys are occupying the wrong places.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.30
Get to Washington.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.31
But don't demand your fellow Citizens pay for your own mistakes or problems with Banks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.32
We're broke.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.33
The Entitlement Gravy Train is off the tracks and out of gravy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.34
So to clarify, bankers/investors/lobbyist take knowingly absurd risks and engage in frivolous and unwarranted spending with money people have entrusted them as their futures (home, retirement, college, etc).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.35
Then, the bubble bursts and we have to assign accountability.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.36
Ready, go...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.37
The lawmakers choice to bail out the banks is an entirely separate issue of accountability.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.38
That legislation was headed by Republicans under the Bush administration but was very partisan in nature, however measures of spending accountability were absolutely mishandled.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.39
But again totally different argument.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0048.40
Responsibility for the event lies with...?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0049.30
Well see,there's your own Entitlement attitude slipping out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0049.31
Just sounds like you're blaming everyone else for your own mistakes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0049.32
That's just way too common in the OWS Movement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0049.33
I'm not defending Big Banks that got Taxpayer Bailouts but Citizens have to be held accountable too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0049.34
They played a big part in the economic collapse.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0049.35
Bad decisions and greed is what got a whole lot of Citizens in trouble too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0049.36
But anyway,if you want to blame Wall Street for all your problems then go for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0049.37
Sue them and try to get some money out of them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0049.38
But don't demand fellow Citizens/Taxpayers pay for your mistakes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0049.39
The Gravy Train really is all out of gravy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0050.34
For some reason you remind me of Dennis Leary (Video has a few F-bombs if your at work)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0050.35
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAVoQfoU0dQ">STFU - Dennis Leary - YouTube</a>
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0051.27
Yea it does seem that most in the OWS Movement want to blame everyone but themselves for their own mistakes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0051.28
That's why i can no longer support them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0051.29
They had it right in the beginning when it was about being angry at Wall Street.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0051.30
I could get behind that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0051.31
But then it became all about the Entitlement attitude.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0051.32
'Generation Gimme' stepped in and hijacked the Movement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0051.33
Now i just see them as Entitlement Whiners.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0051.34
And i think most Americans are now seeing them that way too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0051.35
Anyway,thanks for the hilarious vid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0051.36
It is classic.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0052.1
It's all about the Taxpayer-funded Freebies in the end for both Wall Street and OWS.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0052.2
They want to steal from fellow Taxpayers to better themselves.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0052.3
They're demanding their handouts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0052.4
What do we do now with this Self-Entitlement Monster?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0052.5
The Well's run dry. We're broke.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0053.28
Thats why I liked them at first too...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0053.29
but when the cries for a "guaranteed middle class job out of college" and "I shouldn't have to pay off my loans" amongst others started being more prevelant than anything else I became disgusted by them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0053.30
If the tea party stopped being about fiscal conservatism and the debt and transformed into a conservative social issues movement I would feel the same sense of disgust toward it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0054.17
Yea i think good honest people were there at the start of the Movement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0054.18
But they were quickly booted and replaced with 'Generation Gimme' whiners.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0054.19
And i'm sure George Soros had a hand in hijacking the Movement too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0054.20
It is sad but that's where it stands currently.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890854_0054.21
I can no longer support them.

Half of Unemployment Rate Decline Due to People Giving Up Job Search, Labor Data Show · December 2, 2011  Half of the 0.4 percent decline in the nations unemployment rate is due to people giving up hope of finding a job and leaving the labor force altogether in November, government data and CNSNews.com calculations show.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0006.4
In the month of November, 315,000 people left the labor force altogether, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported on Friday.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0006.5
The unemployment rate, reported today, has declined by 0.4 percent  from 9.0 in October to 8.6 percent in November.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0006.6
However, had those 315,000 people not left the labor force, the unemployment rate would have been 8.8 percent  0.2 percent higher than the officially-reported 8.6 percent rate for November.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0006.7
The unemployment rate went down for two reasons: the economy created 120,000 jobs and 315,000 people left the labor force in November.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0006.8
If those who had left the labor force are added back into it and added to the ranks of the unemployed  because they do not have jobs  the small decline in the unemployment rate is cut in half  to 0.2 percent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0006.9
In October, the size of the labor force was 154 million people and 13.9 million were unemployed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0006.10
In November, the labor force was 153.9 million people and 13.3 million were unemployed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0006.11
Other BLS data show the true jobless nature of the current economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0006.12
Despite the 120,000 jobs added in November, the overall population grew by 172,000, meaning that there are not enough jobs being created to keep up with population growth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0006.13
Those 172,000 people went right into the ranks of those who are not in the labor force at all, a figure which rose to 86.6 million in November, up 487,000 during the month.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0006.14
Secondly, the number of those who want a job now, according to the BLS, rose 192,000 in November, going from 6.4 to 6.55 million people in November.

So we've heard 2 years worth of Obama whining like his OWS peasants, Him mostly whining about a "do nothing Congress" and the "GOP obstruction" stopping him from doing anything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.2
Now unemployment is down to 8.6%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.3
And libtards are dropping to their knees to PRAISE HIM!!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.4
Why?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.5
CEO's approved this hiring.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.6
Corporations funded it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.7
Barack Hussein Obama has been hampered by a "do nothing Congress" and "GOP obstructionists"......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.8
right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.9
So when shit goes bad, Obama is immune from blame, because a do-nothing Congress and the GOP are preventing Him from dong anything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.10
But when things go well, He gets immediate credit, despite the fact that all that new hiring is being done by the very CEO's and corporations He and his ilk spew verbal venom at every chance they get.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.11
Thanks to all the CEO's and corporations for taking the chance to go ahead and hire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.12
We know, with Obama in office the future is very unknown and shaky, but you guys hired anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.13
Keep up the good work.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.14
And Mr. President...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.15
try not to fuck it up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.16
Of course, you cant't do much with a do-nothing Congress, so not sure why you got credit for it anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.17
CEO's were hiring--
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.19
"I'm saying it bluntly, that this administration is the greatest wet blanket to business, progress and job creation in my lifetime.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.20
A lot of people don't want to say that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.21
They'll say, 'Oh God, don't be attacking Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.22
' Well, this is Obama's deal, and it's Obama that's responsible for this fear in America."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.23
"The guy [Obama] keeps making speeches about redistribution, and maybe 'we ought to do something to businesses that don't invest or hold too much money.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0007.24
' We haven't heard that kind of talk except from pure socialists."

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0014.2
A right-winger admitting unemployment is actually down.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0014.3
I guess Obama only gets credit when unemployment goes up
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0014.4
I think it is a safe and secure answer to the question; "Why are you a liberal?"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0014.5
Because I don't want to be associated with Bucs90.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0015.18
Start with the one that pays you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0015.19
Because, unless you are a government employee, a CEO is in charge of you being employed and paid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0015.20
That "CEO" might be Mom or Pop and their community grocery store.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0015.21
It might be the CEO of Boeing or WalMart.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0015.22
It might be the CEO who owns wealthy, but local, food chains, like Charleston's Sticky Fingers, or the South's Chic Fil A.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0015.23
But if you work, and you aren't a gov't employee, then somewhere out there is a person who enables your continued employment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0015.24
Not saying we must kiss anyones ass.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0015.25
Not saying we "owe" them anything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0015.26
They ask for a job to be done, we ask for payment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0015.27
So long as both keep doing their part, the deal is going.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0015.28
So, I thank the CEO who decided to keep my position funded, and the manager who hired me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0016.17
We are supposed to thank the President everyday....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0016.18
because he makes all this possible.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0017.1
There has got to be a way that we can all hook up to a service like "Go To Meeting" annonymously next November 6th.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0017.2
I would pay a fair sum to be able to see the looks on the faces of these crazy people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0018.20
Well it would be a change from the foul abuse he's had so far,but if Obama walked on water,a hypocrite like YOU would report "OBAMA CAN'T SWIM"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0018.21
You are a drone compared to President Obama.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0018.22
a true American
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.17
Actually, there's nothing to thank CEO's or Obama for in these numbers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.18
You drill down into them, they are pretty awful.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.19
First, the economy only produced 120,000 jobs in November.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.20
150,000 is considered baseline growth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.21
The reason the number dropped was that the "Household Survey" only counts those who are employed or looking for work, not those who have given up because unemployment benefits have run out or they find they can get buy without working.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.22
375,000 people dropped out of the workforce altogether.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.23
Also, most of these jobs that were created were low paying ones.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.24
Hospitality and retail jobs that were created for the holiday rush.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.25
A lot of these jobs will be eliminated when demand goes down after the holidays.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.26
Looming on the horizon, the Euro-Crash and state and local governments having to slash payrolls to meet budget shortfalls.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.27
Private sector payrolls were up 140,000.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.28
But as has been happening month after month,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.29
government payrolls were down.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.30
Down 20,000 last month.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.31
The size of government has been shrinking dramatically...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.33
just as conservatives claim they want and just as conservatives claim is good for jobs and the economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.34
So why aren't you happy?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0023.35
Instead of trying to blame Obama for tepid job growth...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0024.36
The tepid growth is because of policy dufus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0025.1
So how many threads do we need to show how really, really stupid we can be??
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0025.2
If anyone actually thinks the employment market is better, why don't you go see how many of your neighbors have recently found a job.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0025.3
Well other than part time, seasonal work which won't even qualify them for UE benefits.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0026.1
8.6% unemployment is an accomplishment ?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8890894_0027.2
It is!!

Despite the derisive references that continue even today, Al Gore did not claim he "invented" the Internet, nor did he say anything that could reasonably be interpreted that way.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891048_0025.25
The "Al Gore said he 'invented' the Internet" put-downs were misleading, out-of-context distortions of something he said during an

To claim that Gore was seriously trying to take credit for the "invention" of the Internet is, frankly, just silly political posturing that arose out of a close presidential campaign.

- The stimulus has created millions of jobs in the PRIVATE SECTOR.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.7
Even in light of this recent information, repubs still say it was a waste.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.8
Not true.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.9
- The unemployment rate dropped from 12% to 8%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.10
(Yes, it's now at 9%, but obviously we are better off than we could have been).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.11
- Obama has made good on most of his campaign promises (as reported by PolitiFact).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.12
- He has killed/captured 5X as many Al-Queda terrorists in his first 3 years than Bush did in all his 8 year presidency.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.13
(Don't believe me?

Look it up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.15
In fact, I first learned of this fact on Fox News of all sources).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.16
Much has changed in America since Barack Obama was sworn into office as the 44th president of the United States on January 20, 2009.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.17
In less than 1,000 days as chief executive of the U.S., President Obama's failed policies and initiatives have resulted in a dizzying array of dismal economic statistics.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.18
As it stands now, Obama appears headed toward an economic legacy that may very well surpass Jimmy Carter in its level of failure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.19
We have seen under this president an expanding number of citizens who are partially or wholly dependent on the government for their very livelihood, as the data show that the U.S. has become an ever-growing welfare state under Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.20
Government dependence, which is defined as the percentage of persons receiving one or more federal benefit payments, is at a staggering 47%, its highest level in American history, while 21 million households are reliant on food stamps.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.21
In fact, government spending on food stamps in 2010 ($68 billion) was double what it was in 2007, with the 2011 figure likely to be even higher.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.22
According to the August employment report from the Department of Labor, the nation's unemployment rate remained at 9.1% with a total of zero jobs added to the economy during the month.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.23
Among demographic groups, Latinos had an unemployment rate of 11.3%, while African-Americans posted a rate of 16.7%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.24
For blacks, that represents the highest unemployment rate for this group since 1984 and a rate more than double that of whites (8%).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.25
When Obama took office in January 2009, the nation's unemployment rate stood at 7.8%, a rate higher than the historic norm, yet far below the current rate, and above any rate during the Bush administration.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.26
Since June 2009, six months into Obama's term, the nation's unemployment rate has been at or above 9% during 25 of 27 consecutive months.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0007.27
Those are the official unemployment rates.

The real unemployment rate, as it is sometimes referred to, rose to a seasonally adjusted 16.2% in August.

But wait there's more

The increase in employment partially reflected the return to payrolls of about 45,000 Verizon telecoms workers who had been on strike in August.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0017.27
The number of unemployed people, at 14 million, remained essentially unchanged in September.

<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/oct/07/us-new-jobs-unemployment-rate">US adds 103,000 new jobs as unemployment rate unchanged | Business | guardian.co.uk</a>
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0017.29
So there weren't 103,000 jobs added to the economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0017.30
Someone is cooking the numbers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0017.31
I wonder who?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.16
Reach Much?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.17
We were promised Unemployment would never go above 8% if we passed the Stimulus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.18
If you think 250,000 Plus per "Job" Created was a good thing, then by all means it was a stunning success.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.19
Unemployment was never 12%, and was lower than it has been under Obama, under Bush.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.20
Made good on his Campaign Promises which ones?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.21
Closing Gitmo?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.22
Uniting the World?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.23
Not Letting Unemployment go above 8%?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.24
Being Transparent?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.25
Being Bipartisan?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.26
WTF are you talking about?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.27
Your Claim that he has killed 3 times as Many Al Qeada is completely False.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.28
We killed Thousands under Bush.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.29
Besides Obama is continuing Bush Polices that He (Ran Against) in order to kill those Terrorists.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.30
Osama would still be alive if not for Programs Bush Started that Obama called wrong, and Illegal, and then Continued.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.31
You are about as clueless as they come dude.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.32
Obama has been a Massive and Utter Failure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.33
Worst Leadership I have ever seen from any president ever.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.34
The Current Debt Crisis illustrates his Lack of Leadership For all to see.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.35
He thinks he can just come up with a Number and order Congress to figure out how to reach it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.36
He does not have the balls to put his own Numbers on the Table, and suggest how they pay for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.37
Because he isn't a leader, he is a perpetual Campaigner and chief.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.38
I am wrong about the unemployment rate, but every other point I made about Obama is true.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.39
You can claim it's false all you want, but facts are facts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.40
That is the denial that I referred to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.41
Thank you for demonstrating my point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.43
When I have more time (tomorrow), I will provide the sources for all of this information.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.44
But really, if you were actually informed on current events, I wouldn't have to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0018.45
You forgot to include how he's created the greatest divide between people in this country since the Civil War.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0021.45
Then you should have waited until you had done the research FIRST..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0021.46
Then posted your thread.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0021.47
Too late.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0021.48
You don't get a do over..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0021.49
BTW, when it comes to facts...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0021.50
YES you do...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0022.36
Lol, I don't get a "do over"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0022.37
What are you 12?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0029.2
The reason he's smiling is because you and many others still believe his lie.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0030.45
You're not talking about current events.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0030.46
You're talking about White House press releases.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0030.47
Reality steadfastly refuses to cooperate with leftist fantasy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.16
Your question is not a question at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.17
It's your opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.18
Unemployment....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.19
Your side uses the excuse for the high number as " it would have been far worse"....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.20
You nor anyone else does not know that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.21
There are no facts to support any of the numbers of "saved jobs"..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.22
The only number that matters is the official unemployment number which is 9%...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.23
A number which the Obama admin attempts to pass off as " the new normal"..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.24
Spin.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.25
This is such hypocrisy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.26
IN one instance your side states that businesses are not hiring.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.27
They are sitting on over a trillion dollars in cash.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.28
On the other hand your side states that MILLIONS of private sector jobs have been created...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.29
SO which is it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.30
Which is the LIE?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.31
Obama has killed?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.32
Ummm, not quite.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.33
For that matter, NO WAY.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.34
Obama is coat tailing the operations set up by the previous admin.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.35
The peopel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve ALL of the credit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.36
Obama gets NONE.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.37
So cut the bullshit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.38
No politician conservative or liberal gets the credit for military successes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.39
The fighting men and women get the credit because THEY did it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.40
You spew here what you claim to be facts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.41
In the absence of proof using links with facts, your post is opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.42
That's that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.43
Obama's policies are the most anti -business anti freedom and anti capitalist of ANY presidential admin in recent memory...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.44
Except those of Jimmy Carter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.45
Now get to work and provide those links.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.46
And be very careful from where you get your information.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.47
It will be scrutinized.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.48
We ask questions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.49
And question answers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.50
If you are an Obama sycophant, just be a stand up guy/gal and admit it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.51
This would save everyone a lot of time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0031.53
"You must spread some rep around etc."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0032.2
You're giving Obama credit for that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0038.16
Do you watch Fox News?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0039.4
I am.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0040.16
And yet there are fewer jobs now than there were when he took office.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0040.17
And yet to make this happen, the Feds have reduced the jobs available number by about 2.5 million and that is why the unemployment rate has dropped.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0040.18
Without that change in the formula, the UE Rate is still above 12%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0040.19
Close Gitmo, fix the worst economy since the Great Depression, Out of Iraq, out of Afghanistan, open and transparent government, end of crony capitalism, bi-partisan cooperation and honesty.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0040.20
0 for whatever in most of what he promised.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0040.21
I suppose this beats trying them in courts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0040.22
Eliminates the need to read rights if the suspects is lying around in several pieces.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0040.23
The legal and humane way to arrest suspects.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0041.1
Everyone but Foxbots realize he got a lot done before Pubs started blocking everything 2/2010- now assume the position...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0041.2
Care to list what he did that was beneficial?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0042.6
Sure you can but let's really give obama credit for helping Americas enemy in Libya.

Al qudea
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.16
Obama has done more than that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.17
And, he was an incredible state senator and US Senator.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.18
Republicans can't get passed the black.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.19
You get them calling Obama "man-child" at 50 years old (code for boy) and "magic negro" and so on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.20
The list is endless.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.21
They constantly try a lame attempt that Bush was made fun of so it's OK if they do it too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.22
When you point out that Bush, at one time, was the most popular president in history, they make up even more lame excuses that Democrats were "afraid" of not supporting him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.23
OK, then they did support him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.24
Which was it, they did or didn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.25
The Republican Party is 90% white, old and based in the Confederate South.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.26
They are acting the way conservatives have for over a hundred years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.27
It's who they are.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.28
They just hate Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.29
Many of the things they say are so fantastic, they would never say those things about anyone else.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.30
Anti Christ?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.31
Really?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.32
I guess it's just different...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.33
somehow...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.34
when leftists do it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0043.36
Dave are you shocked that two idiots agreeing about obama?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0044.6
Then he certainly deserves credit for what's happening now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0045.16
Where's your links for all of these "accomplishments?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0045.17
I believe that is the procedure here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0046.1
it doesnt matter how many times you say it, the stimulus failed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0046.2
the economy is worse than ever.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0046.3
obama accomplished nothing, nothing good anyway,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0046.4

Good grief, why?

Never.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0052.6
They don't want to hear about that or what's happening in Egypt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0052.7
Is this what obama supported in Egypt?

So you are claiming 3 Hugely Unpopular Pieces of Legislation as Victory?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0053.3
Ramming through Health Care, Stimulus, and Dodd/Frank against the will of the people is all you have to hold on to?

Sucks to be you.

Republicans were given the power to Block Obama's Agenda after only 2 years for a reason.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0053.6
People don't like Obama's Agenda.

The housing market is still being manipulated by a meddling and intrusive federal government.

We still have a federal government that goes around suing states for trying to do within the law what the White House will not regarding illegal immigration.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0060.17
We have a federal government acting in deference to unions and union activists, attempting to stop a major aircraft firm from doing business where it sees fit....

Obamabots believe Obama doesn't lie.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0076.2
Reality, of course, disagrees.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0076.3
I'm shocked he was even elected...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0076.4
I've been familiar with Obama since the 90's and the platform he ran on in 08 was nothing but lies...

The guy is a lying racist elitist communist...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0076.6
Apparently the majority of who voted for him didn't read "Dreams From My Father" or even bothered to check his voting history...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0076.7
I would certainly label him a narcissist or a psychopath.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0076.8
Everything he does is to keep his power base.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0076.9
He doesn't care about anyone but himself - As a matter of fact I believe hes obsessed with himself...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0076.10
This dickhead threw his own mother under the bus who raised him then praised his drunk communist father (which he only met a few times) to score brownie points with self loathing white progressives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0076.11
Now, now, the press asked him some pretty hard-hitting and no-nonsense questions like: "So, Senator Obama...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0076.12
just exactly how awesome ARE you, anyway?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0076.13
The people have a right to know!"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0076.14
Pretty much
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0076.16
It's worse in Chicago - you'd think the guy was the second coming...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0076.17
The Chicago Tribune worships the ground he walks on (or any progressive for that matter) while they degrade any republican they can..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0077.16
It's a shame, such a great state as IL saddled with that shithole of corruption.

The CBO...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0078.8
Now there's two entities that have zero interest in keeping Obama in the White House.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0078.9
Politifact is a liberal blog.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0078.10
ah the this cite is bias and the CBO doesnt jive with my opinion right now so i wont use it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0078.11
Here's the problem, you walking obscenity, it is NOT opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0078.12
It's fact.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0078.13
There is no possible way the CBO's or any of the various blogs cited numbers here can work.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0078.14
The federal government's own unemployment figures and the current condition of the housing and other consumer markets belie any published numbers handed out by the Left, the White House or CBO.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0078.15
So go ahead and process that for a while.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0078.16
I for one would be thrilled to see unemployment lowered, more people making money.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0078.17
That increases economic activity which stimulates business activity which translates to prosperity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0078.18
The current presidential administration will not let that happen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0079.14
I think my favorite question for President Obama was, "Who is you favorite White Sox player?"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0079.15
Not because of the question, but because of the answer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0079.16
"I, uh...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891325_0079.17

Obama ain't offered SHIT!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.3
He...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.4
has been missing in action through this whole thing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.5
As a matter of fact, the FIRST thing he did when he came back to town was to give companies ANOTHER tax loop hole...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.6
you know, like the ones he CLAIMS he wants to close...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.7
only this one is so magnanimous that he thinks we won't call it what it is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.8
See, it's a TAX BREAK to companies and corporations that hire vets.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.9
Take THAT occupy wall street!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.10
Ain't that wonderful of the man?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.11
Set up a system to fail so that it cuts the defense budget in half, puts thousands of soldiers in harm's way without the equipment they need and then give corporations tax breaks to hire them when they come back in wheel chairs and on crutches.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.12
Wonderful man ain't he?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.13
This is EXACTLY what Obummer and the democrats WANTED to happen with that stupid super committee crap in exchange for raising the debt ceiling in the first place.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.14
If you doubt it, just look at the ideologues they put on the thing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.15
The only mistake the republicans made was in voting to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for anything short of repealing Obamacare and passing the Ryan budget that actually would have cut 4 TRILLION out of the budget.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.16
This president and the democrat party has not only not passed, but has not even OFFERED A BUDGET since Obama took office...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.17
little on offered some grand deficit reduction scheme.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.18
Something that I might add has NEVER HAPPENED before in the history of this country and they damn well could have done since they controlled BOTH HOUSES of Congress for the first 2 years Obama has been in office.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.19
900+ days with out a budget and in contempt of the Constitution.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.20
By the way, the TRUTH of the super committee negotiations is that the democrats didn't off ONE SINGLE PLAN.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.21
The republicans offered several and the last one that the democrats rejected out of hand actually included closing the tax loop holds you mistakenly seem to think the democrats want.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.22
However, as I said, they rejected it out of hand.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.23
They really only want to SAY they want to close the loop holes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.24
They don't want to get caught actually doing it by their corporate masters and fat cat donors!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.25
What put the troops in "harm's way" was invading Iraq for oil..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.26

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0009.27

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0010.1
True.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.1
Wow, you Republicans are really into denial.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.2
Okay here it is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.3
Proof!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.4
Obama:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.5
"The Budget Control Act that I signed into law last month will cut annual Government spending by about $1 trillion over the next 10 years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.6
It also charges the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction with finding an additional $1.5 trillion in savings.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.7
As part of this jobs bill, I am asking the Congress to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of the American Jobs Act.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.8
In addition, I believe that the Congress should seize the opportunity that this new Committee presents and do much more so that we can put the country on a sustainable fiscal path, which is critical for our long-term economic growth and competitiveness.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.9
For this reason, I am sending to the Congress this detailed plan to pay for this jobs bill and realize more than $3 trillion in net deficit reduction over the next 10 years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.10
Combined with the approximately $1 trillion in savings from the first part of the Budget Control Act, this would generate more than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.11
This would bring the Nation to the point where current spending is no longer adding to our debt and where our debt is no longer increasing as a share of our economy--an important milestone on the way to restoring fiscal discipline and moving us toward balance."

There you go.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.14
Can't argue with facts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.15
However, it should be noted that many democrats didn't support the bill either.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.16
I never said democrats shouldn't be to blame for impeding Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.17
Contrary to what Fox News will tell you, Obama is on the center of the political spectrum.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.18
He has been criticized by Democrats for being too diplomatic.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.19
In other words, don't blame Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.20
Blame ALL of congress.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.21
parroting a bunch of comments on the the White House website is not 'proof' of anything other than it was 'promised'.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.22
Do you have the actual bill he proposed, showing the savings mentioned above?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.23
I did not "parrot" a bunch of comments together.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.24
That is an exact quote taken directly from whitehouse.gov.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.25
Come on, is it really that hard to believe?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.26
It's right there in front of you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.27
I did not say 'parrot a bunch of comments together', implying you'd mixed a bunch of stuff together...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.28
you read my comment incorrectly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.29
I said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.30
parroting something from the White House website doesn't count as proof that Obama ever actually submitted what the comments promised.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.31
I want a link to the bill, House or Senate, that Obama introduced, which 'would' be considered proof.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0014.32
Is that so hard for you to understand?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0015.13
What exactly would stop Obama from sending it to the Congress?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0015.14
He didn't say he was in the process of making the bill.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0015.15
The bill was already finalized.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0015.16
He sent the bill and it was rejected.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0015.17
I guess will look for the proof that he sent the bill to congress, but I don't understand why you need that level of proof.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0015.18
Where do I even look for something like that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0016.1
Okay, here is the next best thing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0016.2

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0027.3
Why?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0027.4
Because it included taxing the wealthy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0027.5
It's absolutely ridiculous.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0027.6
Fox News/Republicans are always touting that taxing the wealthy wouldn't make a big dent in the deficit, which is true.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0027.7
However, just because it's a small dent, it doesn't mean that it shouldn't be included in the proposal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0027.8
The tax hikes on the rich that Obama proposed would have reduced the deficit by 300 billion dollars.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0027.9
As small as that amount is toward reducing the deficit, isn't it a good compromise on the issue of taxes considering that the proposal totalled 4 trillion all together in cuts?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0027.10
Can the rich really not handle being slightly less rich than they could be for the sake of getting the country back on track?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0027.11
Now, all we have to show for it is 1.2 trillion in automatic cuts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0027.12
You are liar.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0027.13
BUT YOU THINK A CUT TEN YEARS OUT IS A CUT PROVING YOUR STUPIDITY.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0027.14
It's a cut over 10 years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0027.15
You obviously don't know how these things work....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0036.5
" The Budget Control Act that I signed into law last month will cut annual Government spending by about $1 trillion over the next 10 years.

As part of this jobs bill (LIE ONE.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0036.8
It was the "The Budget Control Act" but he tried to claim it was a jobs bill when in fact it was a deal to INCREASE THE DEBT CEILING.

(BULL SHIT call number 2. He and the demwhits negotiated a deal to INCREASE THE DEBT CEILING and before the ink on it had dried, reneged on the deal and attempted to tie it to his "Stimulus II" wish list which would add another 1.6 TRILLION dollars to the deficit NOW!) In addition...

First, let me address this "Budget Control Act" crap.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0036.17
The ONLY fact in that is that he signed the bill...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0036.18
UNDER PROTEST I might add.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0036.19
Just WHEN was that little bit of legislation signed into law?

Oh yeah, 2011!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0036.21
This law WAS the bill passed in exchange for raising the debt ceiling.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0036.22
Obama had to be dragged kicking and screaming to accept even this TINY little bit of fiscal reform in order to avoid the US defaulting on its debt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0036.23
So that is BULL SHIT!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0036.24
As to the rest of that lunatic ranting and political positioning on whitehouse.gov, There WAS NO BILL INTRODUCED EVER!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0036.25
Why...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0036.26
because democrats didn't want to get attached to a stand alone piece of legislation that raised taxes on ANYONE while adding 1.6 TRILLION dollars in deficit spending.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0036.27
They, just like anyone who actually understands this stuff and the mood of America KNOW that 70% of Americans do NOT favor tax hikes or increased deficits.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891556_0036.28

actions by some of the protestors?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891686_0001.3
What Fox News/Republicans don't seem to understand is that the bigger a movement gets, the more trouble-makers it is going to attract.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891686_0001.4
In other words, the trouble-makers at the OWS protests do not represent the movement itself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891686_0001.5
The OWS from the very beginning had a message of peaceful protesting.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891686_0001.6
That is what the founders of the movement intended.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891686_0001.7
Unfortunately, because the movement is leaderless and has become so wide-spread, some of them have gotten chaotic.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891686_0001.8
That is a human-driven consequence; it is not because of the ideology.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891686_0001.9
I think it is reasonable to criticize the OWS movement as lacking clear goals and leadership.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891686_0001.10
If it did have these qualities, I think more people would take their message more seriously.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891686_0001.11
However, by that same rationale, it is unfair to criticize the movement itself for a few of the trouble-makers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891686_0001.12
Let me put it this way: if the Tea Party had become as popular movement as the OWS has (not even close), would the movement have attracted the same kind of law-breakers we see at these OWS protests?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891686_0001.13
The answer is absolutely.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8891686_0002.3

Even when they create nothing, but just take massive fees for doing nothing, or, in the case of some CEO's get their 'rightful' hands on those multi-million dollar bonuses even if the stock tanks and the company makes a loss.

And yet, polls show that most Americans do not support Tea Party ideas.

As Unions usually do, they chose keeping their Benefits at the level they are, over keeping Cops on the Job, and the Lay offs happened.

I don't think anyone would say so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892003_0020.5
It seems greed is wanting money that legitimately doesn't belong to you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892003_0020.6
I can be as greedy as I want, but unless someone gives me money voluntarily then it doesn't do much.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892003_0020.7
If I deceive someone, then I am a criminal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892003_0020.8

Greed is Wall Street destroying the world economy with a $516 trillion dollar derivatives Ponzi scheme.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892003_0027.14
Greed is one of the Seven Deadly Sins of the Bible:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892003_0027.15
1909 painting The Worship of Mammon by Evelyn De Morgan.Greed (Latin, avaritia), also known as avarice or covetousness, is, like lust and gluttony, a sin of excess.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892003_0027.16
However, greed (as seen by the church) is applied to a very excessive or rapacious desire and pursuit of wealth, status, and power.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892003_0027.17
St. Thomas Aquinas wrote that greed was "a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things."

"Avarice" is more of a blanket term that can describe many other examples of greedy behavior.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892003_0027.20
These include disloyalty, deliberate betrayal, or treason,[citation needed] especially for personal gain, for example through bribery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892003_0027.21
Scavenging[citation needed] and hoarding of materials or objects, theft and robbery, especially by means of violence, trickery, or manipulation of authority are all actions that may be inspired by greed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892003_0027.22

Greed can mean an excessive desire for getting or having something, especially money, but greed is not always a bad thing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892003_0028.15
Greedy people can be, by virtue of their own ambitions, very benevolent and are often charitable people who also employ many others and sign their paychecks.

A Conservative will reply as they have been instructed with something · like "You poop on streets!"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.11
Notice how the issue is avoided and the need for Independent thought · is eliminated?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.12
Conservatives are simply not equipped to deal with the · ISSUES that OWS has brought up, so they parrot what they have been · taught.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.13
The ISSUES?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.14
* WE DON'T WANT TO END CAPTIALISM, WE want to end the Corporatacracy · and restore our Democratic Republic.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.15
For every hour a senator or · congressman spends with a citizen who has a legitimate concern, they · spend over 100 with a lobbyist, CEO or UNION LEADER (Oh Damn, that · eliminates the "Change the Subject Tactic that Conservatives use when · they can't address issues directly!).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.16
There is no voice of the people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.17
Anyone thinking our government is not run by money, is a fool.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.18
* No more bank bailouts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.19
This includes Fannie May and Freddie Mac, btw · (Oh Damn, that eliminates the "Change the Subject Tactic that · Conservatives use when they can't address issues directly!).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.20
* Stop giving money belonging to We the People, away to the corrupt · politicians of foreign governments.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.21
* No more subsidies or tax breaks to any company that doesn't hire · 100% American, attribute their income 100% in America and pay their · taxes 100% in America.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.22
* Reverse "Citizen's United" and put elections back in the hands of · The People.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.23
* Repeal Gramm-Leach-Bliley (Like Newt Says!).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.24
Those are just some of the ISSUES.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.25
How will Conservatives respond to · the issues?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.26
We all know.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.27
Dodge, change the subject, Project What they · Have been Instructed to Believe etc...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.28
Well · guess what Conservs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.29
The Tea Party didn't promote ending the intereference of · religion in politics.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.30
They're overwhelingly old and Conservative.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.31
OWS is · overwhelmingly Young and Liberal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.32
So duh.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.33
Gee.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.34
Go figure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.35
Just a tactic to dodge · the issues they bring up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.36
Replace them with your own.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.37
But Conserv won't address these issues.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.38

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.40
our reply is why aren't you bitching that the unions buy up all the demoncrat politicians.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0005.41
you lying asswarp of a cow.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0006.1

Who's got a better one?

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0006.5
Gramm-Leach-Blilely?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0006.6
Nope.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0006.7
Just as your ThoughtMasters told you to do!

Thanks!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0007.1
You and others like you have proven beyond all doubt that it is a waste of time to reply to liberal rants.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0007.2
The liberals are running (and ruining) this country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0007.3
Liberalism is a fucking mental disorder!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0008.10
Well played!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0008.11
How obedient the lemmings are!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0009.39
Yeah....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0009.40
right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0009.41
The left just wants the gov't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0009.42
to tell you what to do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0009.43
Funny how the left hates the truth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0010.10
I would like to thank you for being a complete moron and showing everyone what the left is really all about.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0011.4
If we could only learn from our mistakes!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0011.5
Let's review: · 2001 a federal budget surplus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0011.6
Then tax cuts for the rich, two wars fought on credit borrowed from the Chinese.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0011.7
Then deregulation of the banking system and Wall Street.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0011.8
gee.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0011.9
I wonder which policies really screwed the pooch?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0011.10
Maybe we should run right back to the Conservative policies that squandered the surplus, reduced revenues by cutting taxes for those who are most comfortable and borrow from our economic competition to pay for wars we should never have fought in the first place.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0011.11
Or we could poke sharp sticks in our eyes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0011.12
Either way makes as much sense as the other.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0012.10
My thoughtmasters are telling me to call you a fuckin' idiot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0012.11
Sorry, they made me do it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0013.13
More left wing bull crap.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0013.14
There was no surplus, Clinton played with the numbers and Newt balanced the budget.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0013.15
You wouldn't know the truth if it mattered to you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0014.42
Your grandchildren must be very proud of your filthy mouth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0020.39
I'm pissed off at your fucking White House giving 1.4 BILLION $$$$$ to a 1% bastard like Robert Kennedy Jr. to bail out his "green" company.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0020.40
Now if you want to start "Occupy the White House Elites who perform Financial Fellatio on a daily basis with Rich Donors", I could get behind that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0021.13
There was no surplus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0021.14
I assume you are referring to the imaginary surplus created by the voodoo economics of the Slick Willy administration.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0021.15
Try again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0021.17
The rest of your post is opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0021.19
I remember during the campaigns of 2000 they, the press, was calling the recession at that time the "Clinton recession".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.10
How many times are you going to post the same tripe pretending like it's factual?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.11
You purport to know what OWS is all about.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.12
Guess what, there is no concise belief system of OWS.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.13
There are so many divergent point of views, there is no way to actually begin to discuss the 'movement' in an intelligent, logical manner.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.14
You can re-post all the points of legitimate contention over and over.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.15
However, when the vast majority of the movement has been an uncivilized assault on the rest of society peppered with vapid chants, you're not going to convince anyone that it has any more substance than a teenager's temper tantrum.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.16
Crony capitalism has been on the fore front of political debate for at least a few years now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.17
And it got there without any of the vitriol of the OWS.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.18
At this point in time, the OWS has not only changed absolutely nothing or put forward any new objections or ideas, they have actually made a mockery of some very legitimate greivances.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.19
More often than not OWS protestors are targeting their peers on the street rather than anyone who has committed any actual wrong doing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.20
You call that an intelligent movement?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.21
Castigating working people for trying to make a living?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.22
That's not only misdirected, it's compelely stupid and counter productive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.23
And you wonder why no one takes anything about the so called movement seriously?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.24
By all means, wake up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.25
Now here's a decent post worth reading.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0022.26
While the OWSers are entitled to make their point about income inequality and greed, the manner in which they're doing it does not serve the cause very well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.25
Well unlike the ignorant azzhole with the Detroit Lions avatar, you at least make some points - even though you do exactly what the OP says - which is ignore all the points that the 2nd Phase of OWS is forwarding.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.26
So here is the difference between us: I can acknowledge your points.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.27
Yes, there are a lot of in OWS we would all rather not have there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.28
But as far as making grievances in the way that you feel it should be done?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.29
Well what's that gotten you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.30
Cronyism disappear from politics, did it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.31
Less influence of corporations, SIGs and unions on elections?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.32
How about that Citizen's United decision, eh!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.33
Oh yeah, THAT helped.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.34
Now I never lived in a tent but I'm glad these people did.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.35
They started a wake up call.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.36
It has evolved way beyond the tents now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.37
Oh, and I started another thread that simply let people know that what they were seeing on the MSM about OWS, was no more comprehensive that what was shown about the Tea Party at first.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.38
Offered some of the issues.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.39
What were the replies from Conservs?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.40
Not ONE said "Well let's discuss this issue about...."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.41
Just a bunch of parrots repeating what the MSM has fed them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.42
Like 1984...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.43
This thing has just grown thousands of times bigger and gotten a lot more attention.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.44
Growing pains of an movement that is still in it's embryonic phases.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0040.45
We are NOT going away.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0041.28
But they won't address the issues.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0041.29
The ThoughtMasters have told them · not to...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0041.30
And the MSM has been doing this for years and years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0041.31
The Right has ONE, count them ONE media outlet and the f'ing 10+ left wing media masters can't stand it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0041.32
You do realize this has been going on for years and years on your (cough, cough) news sites.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0041.33
They lost all journalistic integrity by filling everyone with lies and left wing BS and you have the nerve to b*tch about the ONE right leaning cable news network.

Their ThoughtMasters have forbidden it!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0045.11

You lack both independence and logic.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0050.43
And you wonder why people don't address the 'issues' you raise.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8892164_0050.44

The president and vice-president can't be from the same state.

49-44 does not indicate a strong challenge.

If an incumbent is polling behind the challenger then it's a strong challenge.

This issue came up in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_presidential_campaign">2000 presidential campaign</a> when Texas Governor George W. Bush chose fellow Texas resident Richard Cheney to be his running mate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724642_0020.6
Cheney, who had served in Congress as a Representative from Wyoming, quickly changed his legal residence back to Wyoming to avoid the possible conflict for electors from Texas.

It is unlikely that two people from the same state would ever be nominated by a major political party.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724642_0020.9
It is constitutionally possible however.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724642_0020.10
If it ever came to pass, the party that won the ticket's state would likely suggest to the electors that their votes for the President go to the presidential nominee and that the votes for the Vice President be given in honor of a party official.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724642_0020.11

Until you people look at the loopholes for Gate's and Buffet's estates, I certainly wouldn't be using them as stellar examples to prove your points.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0021.8
The relatives will be well taken care of through the Trusts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0021.9
Not much will be able to be taxed, because of the charities within the Trusts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0021.10
I have to laugh at some of you for even bringing these fine examples of capitalism to the forefront.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0021.11
actually your an idiot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0021.12
Most of Buffetts and Gates estates are actually being donated to charity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0021.13
Buffets business will be taken over by his children.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0021.14
but they will only be assuming leadership, since the majority of Buffetts wealth is in his shares of Berkshire Hathaway, it will be transfered to the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation over the next few years in the form of stock.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0021.15
Which will then be sold on the open market and the proceeds will benefit the charity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0021.16
Buffett wants his children to earn their own money like he did, not get it free.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0021.17
nice try with him simply giving his money to his heirs tax free.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0022.15
You have to look a little closer than that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0022.16
No, I'm not an idiot....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0022.17
the keyword is charities, and who are on the boards of those charities.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0022.18
But, keep trying....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0023.1
Yep all income should be taxed exactly the same no matter how you got it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0023.2
Even if it's already been taxed once?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0023.3
Tell me, do you pay taxes at the grocery store on the food you buy and then pay taxes again when you eat it?

How many bites of the apple does the gubmint get?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0023.5
The answer is....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0023.6
NO.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0023.7
You don't pay again for it when you eat it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0023.8
But I'm sure if they could figure out a way they would try to tax what we put in our mouths when we put it in our mouths and then again when it comes out of our asses.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0024.15
Not everyone is as rich or as selfish towards his kids as Bill Gates is.

It's funny all those on here that don't have a problem with the "estate tax" don't have a dog in the fight.

I'd wager most are on the govt.

As for me I have worked for many years for the wealth I've aquired and my children should reap all the benefits, after all they're the reason I worked my ass off all these years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0031.5
And for this they should be made to pay taxes on money that has already been taxed?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0031.6
It's time we get every single liberal puke out of Washington and make government, the government our forefathers invisioned, which is to insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and future generations.

You aren't going to be subject to an estate tax.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0031.8
And if you were, I'd question your values in the claim that your little angels need more than $5 million + 65% of the wealth in excess of that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0031.9
How are they ever going to learn the value of hard work just like you did?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0032.5
When you buy groceries with your paycheck, that money has been taxed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0032.6
When the grocery store profits from your purchase, they get taxed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0032.7
When the grocer buys new furniture with his taxed earnings, the furniture store gets taxed on their profits.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0032.8
So yes, money gets taxed, generally, every time it changes hands.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0032.9
I don't know why that's so difficult to grasp.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0032.10

What right does the government have to something it had already taxed and taken their (incorrect) 'fair share'?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0034.7
You're right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0034.8
It is NOT fair to double tax.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0035.10
I'm not?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0035.11
Can I get a written guarantee on that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0035.12
The values my children do or do not learn is of no concern to you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0035.13
Oh and you're not me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0036.10
No you're not right, you say every time money changes hands it gets taxed, but you fail to recognize that money earned and that has been taxed will be taxed a second time upon death per the estate tax.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0036.11
Your comparing money that has been earned, taxed, spent thus being earned by another party, taxed and spent again etc etc...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0036.12
not the same as the estate tax at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0036.13
You fail!

bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0038.9
And THAT is the debate being had.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0038.10
The 35% on amounts over $5M is the compromise, and frankly, it's a compromise that's slanted incredibly far to the right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0038.11
But it just ain't good enough is it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0038.12
No no, we need *NO* estate tax at all.

If what Barney Frank says is true, that what you inherit isn't worked for thus should be taxed at 55%, what does that say about what the government gets in taxes from us?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0050.2
The government didn't work for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0050.3
Why do they feel they have a right to all of that money?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0050.4
This assumes that what we didn't actually work for automatically belongs to the government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0050.5
This is why Barney Frank's argument is wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0050.6
You shouldn't be taxed higher just because, in his opinion, you didn't work for it.

this isnt a monarchy and never has been.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.4
heirs didnt work a day in their life to earn anything, so why should they be able to get everything for free?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.5

or did you forget about that little clause...

if you did its article 1, section 8 as well as the 16th amendment.

now if an heir to a business actually works at the business, then it can be passed on to them without much tax consequence.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.23
all you need to do is hire a lawyer and go through the proper channels and paperwork.

You're pulling my leg, right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.27
because thats not the way it works, its taxed as an asset and due in CASH within a year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.28
but many heirs did not actually do anything to deserve the $ other than being born.

no jobs at the hotel, no college education, nothing but being born a hilton.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.31
do they deserve have the family business?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.32
what about actors children?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.33
or politicans children?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.34
or musicians children?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.35
they obviously had no hand in creating the family wealth, yet the benefit for the simple reason of being born into that family.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.36
who cares?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.37
the money that is spun off the bus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.38
has already been taxed, so has the income that created a simple cash inheritance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.39
i dont have any dog in the fight.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.40
especially since any estates i stand to inherit will fall well below the estate tax threshold.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.41
plus my family has basically said they are gonna spend everything "they" earned before they die.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.42
which i said more power to them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.43
i didnt feel entitled to their money because im their child.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.44
its their money, i didnt do anything to help them earn it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.45
well if its 'their money' than why are you campaigning to mess with mine?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0056.46

Well you see, people who built their own wealth to take care of their family are really greedy bastards who don't deserve the fruits of their labor or the right to decide what to do with it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0057.31
The government has the right......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0057.32
nay, the obligation to recover a portion of that and hand it over to the common man who isn't as "lucky".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0058.31
But what if it were above the threshold and they want to give it to you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0058.32
Why would you feel the government is entitled to a portion of what your parents earned and paid taxes on?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0058.33
if it were above the threshold, i would be intelligent enough to retain a lawyer and explore the most economical ways to have the estate passed on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0058.34
there are many legal avenues to limit the estate tax.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0058.35
and since they are not taxing my parents, and this is new money to me, then it has the right to be taxed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0058.36
im not championing the idea that i like taxes, but with it being new income to my person, it should be subject to taxes.

No, seriously, were you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.12
My father-in-law gave my son his father's (f-i-l's dad and my sons great grandfather) shotgun.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.13
It was a family posession handed down from generation to generation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.14
Should my son have been taxed by the government for this family gift?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.15
It doesn't matter if it is a gun, a family picture album, a doily, your old man's fishnet stocking leg lamp or his monetary fortune.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.16
You posess it and it is yours to do what you choose with it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.17
Why the fuck should the government be entitled to take a portion of my hard earned wealth I want to pass to my son so they can give it to some crack whore mother so she can have things she didn't work for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.18
Hell, if she wants some of my money, she can come ask for a handout.

I'm a very charitable person.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.20
But I decide how and where my money goes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.21
I don't need the gubmint being the middle man.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.22
If you decided you need a piece of my financial pie and went about coming in my house to confiscate it for yourself, I'd be justified in a court of law for putting a nice grouping in your chest to stop you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.23
Why should the gubmint be able to do by force what citizens are not allowed to by gubmint law?

Get it thru your head.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.25
A person's possessions belongs to them and they can do with it what they will and can give it to whoever they choose.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.26
You are not entitled to it if they don't want you to have it and the gubmint shouldn't be able to take it by force and give it to you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.27
If they do.......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.28
what are you going to give in return?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.29
gifting and estate taxes are separate issues.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.30
and since the gun falls under the limit, its not taxed anyway.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.31
try again......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.32
also, if you wanted to legally pass on your estate and it was over the $5M threshold, go hire and lawyer and he will be able to limit the estate taxes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0059.33
stop making excuses.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0061.25
Making excuses?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0061.26
Wouldn't that be you thinking the government is entitled to part of a person's estate?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0061.27

Why is the government entitled to it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0061.29
You've never answered that.

This is income that was taxed when it was earned that has been passed to a family member......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0061.31
no different than some other possession.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0061.32
Why is the government entitled to it other than it is easy pickings and they can send people to your house with guns to get it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0061.33
all income is taxed multiple times.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0061.34
every time it changes hands it is taxed again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0061.35
your taxed on your income, then again on the sales, then again on property, then again and again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0061.36
its the same as you winning the lottery, its free money to the person who receives it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0061.37
an estate also doesnt necessarily have to be passed on to a family member.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0061.38
should your neighbor or friend get it tax free as well?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0061.39

bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0062.21
Not by the same entity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0062.22
Yes, I pay federal and state taxes on each pay check.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0062.23
When I go to the grocery store with the money I earned that the government actually allows me to keep, I pay a LOCAL sales tax.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0062.24
My property taxes are to the COUNTY.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0062.25
Now, if I were being taxed on my income by the feds and then paying a federal tax at the gorcery store, you might have an argument.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0062.26

So I take it you do not live in a state or community that has an income or payroll tax?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0067.24
Many communities have a payroll tax for the priveledge of working in their community whether you live in the community or not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0067.25
so the state taxes you on your income and then again with a sales tax when you spend it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0068.18
It is not that the tax exists, it is what is done with what is levied, it is about consent, it is about acting responsibly with a trust.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0077.18
But if you direct for your wealth to remain within your family, there is no logical reason for the government to demand a piece of it other than they can take it by force.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0078.15

Why should a husband and wife who busted their asses to accumulate an estate to pass on to their children see over half of it land in the hands of government bureaucrats who will then take that money and spend it on utter nonsense?

Don't forget that the Parliament that oppressed the colonists were members of a landed aristocracy, so this was a great concern to the likes of Jefferson.

I don't think that a flat 55% rate is fair or conducive to "the great object."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8724647_0086.12
A progressive rate like that that Jefferson speaks of would be far better.

Even LBJ was lying about it back in sixties.

Johnson maneuvered every step of the way getting this bill through Congress, and one of the things he did  and this is a little dicey in today's climate  was suppress the costs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8725430_0017.18
So this young kid gets elected from Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy, in 1962, and Johnson is explaining to him [over the phone] how you get a health bill through.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8725430_0017.19
And what he tells him is don't let them get the costs projected too far out because it will scare other people:

The bill also assumes savings by cutting Medicare.

Every time they have cut Medicare the Congress has voted to restore funding.

Why is this going to be different?

But the CBO scoring also is good for just the first decade, when as you say payments precede benefits.

It seems that women started turning on Palin when Palin started talking.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0021.26
Perhaps the main issue with Palin is that she poorly represents women and therefore is looked upon as setting back our efforts to gain respect and position in national politics.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0021.27
Hillary lost the primary not because women turned on her..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0021.28
quite the opposite.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0021.29
She lost the primary because she forgot to run an honorable campaign.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0021.30
She turned into the dirty mud slinging typical politician.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0021.31
For her it was more about winning that showing some integrity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0021.32
I believe if she hadn't sunk so low and made so many personal attacks she might've gotten the nod for VP.

And pissing and moaning that all these women are somehow at fault is ridiculous.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0022.5

Some polls are suggesting that after gaining an initial bump, McCain's campaign is being hobbled by Sarah Palin's vice-presidential candidacy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0023.2
The voters who are deserting her fastest, some of whom are even calling on her to withdraw, are mostly women.

Ah, women, the consistently, tragically underestimated constituency.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0023.4
What the Democrats learned during the primaries and the Republicans might now be finding out the hard way, I learned at my very academic, well-regarded all-girls high school: that is never to discount the ability of women to open a robust, committed, well-thought-out vat of hatred for another girl.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0023.5
Women are weapons-grade haters.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0023.6
Hillary Clinton knows it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0023.7
Palin knows it too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0023.8
When women get their hate on, they don't just dislike, or find disfavor with, or sort of not really appreciate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0023.9
They loathe  deeply, richly, sustainingly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8733073_0023.10

bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0042.30
way of doing that and then prioritize our spending ?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0043.1
We had lower Year over Year (YoY) spending under Clinton too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0043.2
It was the combination of lower spending and higher taxes that generated a surplus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0043.3
Obama isn't going to cut spending and McCain will only focus on a quarter of one percent represented by "bad" earmarks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0043.4
There is no shot at a balanced budget under either man.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0043.5
Obama is going to cut spending by $200 billion dollars a year.

Social security benefits have their limits and regardless how much money you make, you cant get more from social security then you put in over the time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0046.3
Yes
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0046.4
When talking about fairness, if you remove cap on payroll tax, woudn't be fair to remove cap on social security benefits and give to rich equivalent in social security based on how much money they put in.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0046.5
Not a bad idea.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0046.6
So if cap is (rounded) $100K, your SS check is (wild guess) $1500.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0046.7
If you remove cap on rich and tax them across the board, would be fair to still pay them social security just $1500 or maybe more, since they paid more taxes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0046.8
The CAP on SSI is too low.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0046.9
No, Obama wants to remove the cap on payrol and keep the cap on SS benefits.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0046.10
Fair enough?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0046.11
A complaint that this liberal thinks has merit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0046.12
While I do believe there should be some cap, I certainly think it's set artificially low, now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8735387_0046.13
Somebody who, under Obama's plan, contributes huge amounts of money to the system deserves to get back more of that money than they currently do.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8737186_0007.15
At the same time, does John McCain ever consider the people that he most likely killed or maimed?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8737186_0007.16
He believed in his cause, but that doesn't mean that he should completely disregard the innocent people that were killed by his bombs:

bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8737186_0008.2
He has a lot of experience where foregn policy is concerned, but I disagree with most of his positions on Middle East affairs that seem to have got us bogged down fighting a war on 2 fronts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181104-8737186_0008.3

bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.8
Yes it is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.9
There are procedures and medications the Government does not cover.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.10
In my specific case several medications I take I can not get at the military hospital because they are not on the list of approved medications so instead I have to use the Tricare system and pay my share rather then get them for free.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.11
And some of them require lots of paper work from the doctor to justify every time it is due for refill.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.12
I have bad legs, I need support stockings to keep from losing my legs, guess what?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.13
The stockings are expensive and the Government does not pay at all for them, no cost share or anything, NOT tricare and not Medicare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.14
I had to spend weeks in physical therapy with my legs wrapped to get the swelling down enough to get the stockings.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.15
All the material I had to buy for those treatments was also not covered.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.16
I can not currently get one of the meds I have taken for years because the Government refuses to pay for it anymore, no cost share nothing, I either have to not take it or pay for it out of pocket.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.17
Currently none of the procedures I have been recommended for are on the no go list, but it exists.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.18
Further in the VA hospital where I could get free treatment there is a laundry list of meds and procedures they simply do not authorize ever.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.19
It is the same for active duty, new procedures that were not pioneered by military doctors take years to get approved before they are authorized by the military.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.20
Wars can speed the process up but as soon as the war is over it goes back to the same old slow approval process.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.21
Dependents that are on the cheapest ( for them) system of Tricare must wait for space in the Military hospitals or ask for special permission to go out of system ( not always approved) And Military Hospitals are short staff and priority is given active Duty, as it should be.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.22
I chose the more expensive method for Tricare because currently Medicare pays my deductible or rather between the two I generally pay nothing for routine care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.23
I did that before I had medicare and paid the extra because if I had signed on for the other way I would have lost my doctors and had to only go through the military and their approved doctors.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.24

I did not have medicare and had to pay 25 percent of the allowed bill every stay if civilian.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.28
I was not able to work when I was in the hospital and was only getting about 1000 dollars in retirement pay, the wife worked at a low paying job as well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0018.29

It sounds as if your health care coverage rations in the exact same way that private health care does.

Which is proof of what I've been telling you people all along.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0019.4

bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0034.10
Are those of us who have not worked for the government "the backs of the successful hard working people", and the ones trying to live off of us 'retired government workers'?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0035.11
Every cent the goverment has comes from taxes----where do you think they get they money to pay the employees ?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0036.1
We can not afford socialized medicine.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0036.2
We already can not afford medicare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0036.3
Yet by adding MILLIONS more suddenly all will be fine?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0036.4
The primary reasons why Medicare runs in the red is the majority of those covered by medicare subsidized by payroll taxes aren't paying premiums.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0036.5
Only $2.9 billion of its income of nearly $231 billion comes from its client base --- which are statistically the sickest demographic (seniors and disabled) and with a larger healthier client base, that means more money in revenue vs expenditures.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0036.6
Cover everyone with Medicare, and the size and overall health of their client base goes up along with the revenue income from premiums.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0036.7
EVERYONE that works pays into medicare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0036.8
EVERYONE.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0036.9
There is no other way to put it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0036.10
Medicare is already subsidized by OUR TAXES from every person in this country that works.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0036.11
And it fails miserably.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0037.12
No it doesn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0038.12
I'm not sure that is true.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0038.13
those who make their income, their living, through investments do NOT PAY MEDICARE taxes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0038.14
And it does not fail miserably, if we had NO medicare at all, then look at it...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0038.15
you will KNOW what failure is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.1
in addition to this the private insurance industry is plagued by the same problem and is one reason why we pay higher rates for our own health insurance policies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.2
This is NOT a copyrighted article and is old, from 1998 talking about the problem....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.3
back then they said it was $100 billion a year in total and $12 billion of it was Medicare, so the private industry is filled with it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.4
Mostly private businesses are the ones committing the crimes against medicare and the insurance industry.

Insurance Fraud and Abuse: · A Very Serious Problem · Stephen Barrett, M.D.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.6
Fraud and abuse are widespread and very costly to America's health-care system.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.7
Fraud involves intentional deception or misrepresentation intended to result in an unauthorized benefit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.8
An example would be billing for services that are not rendered.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.9
Abuse involves charging for services that are not medically necessary, do not conform to professionally recognized standards, or are unfairly priced.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.10
An example would be performing a laboratory test on large numbers of patients when only a few should have it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.11
Abuse may be similar to fraud except that it is not possible to establish that the abusive acts were done with an intent to deceive the insurer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.12
Although no precise dollar amount can be determined, some authorities contend that insurance fraud constitutes a $100-billion-a-year problem.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.13
The United States Goverment Accountability Office (GAO) estimates that $1 out of every $7 spent on Medicare is lost to fraud and abuse and that in 1998 alone, Medicare lost nearly $12 billion to fraudulent or unnecessary claims [1].
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.14
Type of Fraud and Abuse
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.15
False claim schemes are the most common type of health insurance fraud.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.16
The goal in these schemes is to obtain undeserved payment for a claim or series of claims [2].
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.17
Such schemes include any of the following when done deliberately for financial gain:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.18
* Billing for services, procedures, and/or supplies that were not provided.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.19
* Misrepresentation of what was provided; when it was provided; the condition or diagnosis; the charges involved; and/or the identity of the provider recipient.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.20
* Providing unnecessary services or ordering unnecessary tests [3].
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.21
Many insurance policies cover a percentage of the physician's "usual" fee.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.22
Some physicians charge insured patients more than uninsured ones but represent to the insurance companies that the higher fee is the usual one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.23
This practice is illegal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.24
It is also illegal to routinely excuse patients from copayments and deductibles.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.25
(A copayment is a fixed dollar amount paid whenever an insured person receives specified health-care services.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.26
A deductible is the amount that must be paid before the insurance company starts paying.)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.27
It is legal to waive a fee for people with a genuine financial hardship, but it is not legal to provide completely free care or discounts to all patients or to collect only from those who have insurance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.28
Studies have shown that if patients are required to pay for even a small portion of their care they will be better consumers and select items or services because they are medically needed rather than because they are free.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.29
Routine waivers thus raise overall health costs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.30
They are considered fraudulent because averaging them with the doctor's full fees would make the "usual" fees lower than the amounts actually billed for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.31
Other illegal procedures include:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.32
* Charging for a service that was not performed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.33
* Unbundling of claims: Billing separately for procedures that normally are covered by a single fee.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.34
An example would be a podiatrist who operates on three toes and submits claims for three separate operations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.35
* Double billing: Charging more than once for the same service.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.36
* Upcoding: Charging for a more complex service than was performed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.37
This usually involves billing for longer or more complex office visits (for example, charging for a comprehensive visit when the patient was seen only briefly), but it also can involve charging for a more complex procedure than was performed or for more expensive equipment than was delivered.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.38
Medicare documentation guidelines describe what the various levels of service should involve [4].
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.39
* Miscoding: Using a code number that does not apply to the procedure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.40
* Kickbacks: Receiving payment or other benefit for making a referral.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.41
Indirect kickbacks can involve overpayment for something of value.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.42
For example, a supplier whose business depends on physician referrals may pay excessive rent to physicians who own the premises and refer patients.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.43
Another example would be a mobile testing service that performs diagnostic tests in a doctor's office.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.44
Kickbacks can distort medical decision-making, cause overutilization, increase costs, and result in unfair competition by freezing out competitors who are unwilling to pay kickbacks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.45
They can also adversely affect the quality of patient care by encouraging physicians to order services or recommend supplies based on profit rather than the patients' best medical interests.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.46
In 2000, the Office of the Inspector General issued a fraud alert warning against kickbacks disguised as rental payments [5].
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.47
Criminals sometimes obtain Medicare numbers for fraudulent billing by conducting a health survey, offering a free "health screening" test, paying beneficiaries for their number, obtaining beneficiary lists from nursing homes or boarding facilities, or offering "free" services, food, or supplies to beneficiaries.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.48
Excessive or Inappropriate Testing
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.49
Many standard tests can be useful in some situations but not in others.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.50
The key question in judging whether a diagnostic test is necessary is whether the results will influence the management of the patient.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.51
Billing for inappropriate tests—both standard and nonstandard—appears to be much more common among chiropractors and joint chiropractic/medical practices than among other health-care providers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850229_0054.52
The commonly abused tests include:

In the pending health care bills, low-income individuals and families who buy health insurance outside employment will get large government subsidies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0028.19
Those subsidies vary by locale.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0028.20
This represents a significant implicit policy decision with enormous distributional and political consequences.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0028.21

bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0028.25
The premium credit amount would be tied to the second lowest-cost silver plan in the area where the individual resides.

A health plan is not a commodity like a gallon of milk. A health plan in Las Vegas is quite different from one in Portland.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0028.29
While the overall cost-of-living in Portland is higher, health care spending is much higher in Las Vegas.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0028.30
This higher health spending is a function of different prices and different usage of medical care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0028.31
Atul Gawande wrote a much-discussed article on this topic in The New Yorker, The Cost Conundrum: What a Texas town can teach us about health care. There are wide geographic dispersions in medical care spending, and it cannot all be explained by different prices.

were passed it would take no longer than five years before many of the insurers were driven out of business.

As for your Postal Service example, it is a decent one, but there is one major difference between the Postal Service and the public option/health insurance idea.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0039.28
The government has not mandated that UPS provide its services at $0.44 per delivery whereas under the health care plans that have been debated, private insurers are required to provide identical policies at identical prices as the public option and no other policies will be allowed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0039.29
Nor will insurers be allowed to offer policies to new customers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0039.30

The question should be why would employers want to deal with this year after year?

How did healthcare get so tied up with employment?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0039.43
I would think the employers would welcome the opportunity to be able to get out of healthcare problems and run their companies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0039.44
It would be a boon to them and they could put more of their money into their business, rather than employee healthcare.

In fact, those who have now either chosen or been forced to drop their employee's coverage will be forced to either pick it up again or pay a fine aka tax, for not providing coverage.

I stated earlier that my employer cannot afford it, yet, he continues to insist that his company provides it to the employees.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0041.39
Many companies simply cannot afford it and have been forced out of the market to the detriment of the employees and every year more and more companies or being forced out.

And again, if no one has to worry about insurance, all kinds of creative stuff could happen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0042.6
IMO it would be a boon for anyone with a business plan that was afraid to make a move because they'd be without insurance (as it often happens now).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0043.1
many insurance companies will convert to the supplemental health insurance business and elective surgery health insurance....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0043.2
also, most of these insurance companies diversify their investments.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0044.14
Well, a government run plan would have to hire people, too, so it's not clear to me how many jobs net would be lost or gained.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0044.15
What we do know is that if private insurance were replaced by government run insurance similar to Canada's system, massive amounts of capital that insurance companies now invest in our private sector economy would be diverted to buy Treasuries, as Medicare and SS do with their reserve funds, and to pay for the federal government's deficits.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0044.16
I've got to think that withdrawing this much capital from private investment would have a negative effect on economic growth and job creation.

You get laid off your job, in the next thirty days you get a letter from your employer telling you that you have the option to continue your health insurance coverage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0089.7
Within the next 30 days or so, you have to pay last month's and next month's health insurance premiums and you must maintain your payments throughout your unemployment and most likely for the 90 days until your new employer picks up your coverage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0089.8

You're the one that is wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.4
COBRA does help the unemployed...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.5
they can choose to continue their health care insurance if they can afford it until they are employed once again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.6
No one forces anyone to take COBRA.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.7
And yes, it is expensive since the employee must pay the employer's previous share of insurance as well as their own.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.8
COBRA wouldn't be needed if we had a single payer system that was paid for by tax dollars.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.9
Your arguments get weaker, and weaker, and weaker.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.10
You never even responded to the fact that we as taxpayers are already paying for 46% of all American's medical coverage...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.11
and the most expensive groups to boot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.12
Where you are wrong, RAVI, is that the people who really need COBRA are not the ones who leave one employer and move to another right away, it is the people who are laid off and do not have a job and no prospects on the horizon.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.13
Those are the ones that COBRA was designed to protect.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.14
Even people who leave their jobs for another job and have to wait for 90 days before they are covered on their new employer's plan cannot usually afford the additional premiums.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.15
I thought you liberals cared about the needy...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.16
am I wrong?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.18
I don't know where you aren't understanding that before COBRA there was no option but trying to qualify for Medicaid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.19
So if you were layed off and got into an accident or diagnosed with cancer you were pretty well screwed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.20
If this is your objection to a public option I don't understand where you are coming from.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0102.21
A public option or a single payer system would affordably cover these people you are worrying about.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.10
If it was paid for by private dollars the incentive would be more towards what is affordable, rather than blank check spending.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.11
We want expenses to be transparent and accountable, not a black hole.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.12
If what was paid for by private dollars?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.13
Health care?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.14
You must be joking if you are going to claim that the free market keeps health insurance costs down.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.15
If that were true, we'd not be having this discussion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.16
Expenses under Medicare are way more transparent and accountable than they are under private health care providers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.17
The Free Market could keep Health Care down Ravi.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.18
Tort Reform, Liability coverage Reform, Cost of Schooling and loan repayment Reform, anything legitimate to bring cost of services down.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.19
Unjustified mandates multiply cost.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.20
Unnecessary testing increases cost.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.21
Clarify, simplify.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.22
We need less chaos, not more.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.23
What you advocate will overwhelm and multiply cost.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0103.24
It will bankrupt us.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0104.25
COBRA is NOT assistance...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0104.26
it is a law that was passed to prevent insurance cartels from canceling people's health insurance when they lose their jobs by allowing them to PAY for their coverage under group rates...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0104.27
WITHOUT Cobra, the premium would be at an individual rate that would make COBRA look like every day is Christmas...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0105.17
You aren't talking about the free market...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0105.18
you are talking about rewriting the rules so the insurance companies can do whatever they want without penalty.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0105.19
Which isn't really very far from what it is now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0105.20
The free market has NOT kept health care costs down.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0105.21
There are plenty of countries that have some form of public option or single payer health care and none of them are bankrupt or in danger of becoming so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0106.20
It has nothing to do with my objection to the Congressional plans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0106.21
If you go back and read the thread, you will see that Cold Fusion was complaining about COBRA and insinuating that it was private insurance's fault.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0106.22
COBRA has little to do with the current plans and would, in fact, be eliminated by the current plans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0106.23
My objection to the current plans come from the fact that we are exchanging private insurance which is in itself shitty for government moderated insurance and I believe that the government will fail as it has proven itself to do with everything it gets its hands on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0106.24
Once it has its hands in health insurance, the entire idea of coverage for medical expenses is doomed to end up a failure and in the laps of taxpayers down the line ie our great grandchildren.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0106.25
Why is it that Congress has no problem passing along massive deficits to our great grandchildren?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0107.14
I'm going to guess that it also takes care of the pre existing condition clause a bit too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0108.20
No I am not talking about rewriting the rules so the insurance companies can do whatever they want without penalty.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0108.21
I'm talking about making the laws understandable and functional.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0109.14
Yet, it fails!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0109.15
It fails because people who lose their jobs, cannot keep the coverage even though the cartel is prevented from cancelling their health insurance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0109.16
That is why it fails.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0109.17
So, technically, they can lay the blame at the feet of those who lose their jobs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0109.18
The insurance cartel: "Don't blame us!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0109.19
You could have continued your coverage under the COBRA laws but you chose not to."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0109.20
The unemployed worker: "But, I had to pay my mortgage and feed my children."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0109.21
The cartel: "Tough F'ing shit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0109.22
We need to pay our CEO."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0109.24
That is why COBRA sucks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0110.25
COBRA sucks because of the cartels and the CEO's...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0110.26
NOT because it exists...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0110.27
it exists FOR THE SAME REASON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.1
OMG!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.2
How is it possible that the only conservative in this discussion is speaking about helping the poor and the three liberals and possibly a fourth are saying F* the poor?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.3
Immie
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.4
I don't know what you're smoking, but I'd like some.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.5
COBRA isn't meant to help the poor...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.6
it's meant to help the temporarily unemployed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.7
And it does, even though it is expensive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.8
If you are concerned about the poor perhaps you should support a public option of single payer instead of what we've got now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.9
And WHO said fuck the poor?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.10
Not one of us.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.12
I would consider the temporary unemployed the poor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.13
Sorry, but I see no income, or unemployment insurance to mean the poor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.15
You probably posted this before you got to see my last most.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.16
I don't support the "Public Option" because I think it is wrong for everyone including the poor, but it is more than likely better than what we have now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.17
You three have basically been saying F* the poor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.18
My point through this entire discussion has been that it doesn't help those that need it the most and you guys keep acting like you don't give a damned...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.19
meaning F* the poor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.21
I had to take COBRA once when I was between jobs...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.22
and I didn't consider myself poor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.23
Many unemployed people don't consider themselves poor, especially if they expect to be come employed again soon.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.24
You're right...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.25
COBRA doesn't help the poor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.26
It was never meant to help the poor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.27
It's meant to allow people to keep their insurance temporarily before they find another job with insurance benefits.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.28
The poor DON'T HAVE INSURANCE AT ALL.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0131.29
And neither do many of the not actually poor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0132.1
Immanuel, I understand now that you were going for hyperbole.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0132.2
OK.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0132.3
But the conservatives have offered nothing constructive since before the election.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0132.4
Health insurance companies have screwed everyone they can, bribed every elected official and appointed regulator they can, and it is going to stop now!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0132.5
Period.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0132.6
Health insurance reform is happening this term.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0132.7
Conservatives have not done shit for eight years or more and you are right, reform is needed...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0132.8
NOW.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0132.9
I am not at all sure that it will come this term or even the next, but it is sorely needed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0132.10
Nor am I certain what form it should take!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0132.11
Given no reform or the Public Option, I'd have to say something is better than nothing, but I am very concerned that the public option is the first step to utter failure of the health insurance industry.

Affordability · As health care costs continue to grow faster than wages, health insurance will become more and more unaffordable for more and more American families every day.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0132.18
The financial burdens associated with health care and health insurance will only get worse over time without action.The cost of the average employer-sponsored health insurance plan (ESI) for a family will reach $24,000 in 2016.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0132.19
This represents an 84 percent increase over 2008 premium levels.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0132.20
Under this scenario, we estimate that at least half of American households will need to spend more than 45 percent of their income to buy health insurance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0133.21
Sorry guys, It's bad math that will compound the problem.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0133.22
Making Health Care more affordable is the solution, not a Hostile Take Over.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0160.1
That's not true, either.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0160.2
I saved up for it because I knew I was going to need it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0160.3
A rule of thumb is to keep three months set aside in case all goes wrong (maybe six would be better).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0160.4
Has nothing to do with wealth...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0160.5
just common sense and planning ahead.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0160.7
Six months is the minimum recommended by Financial Planners.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0160.8
Unfortunately, when you are raising a family that is not so easy to do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0160.9
In fact, it is about as possible as affording COBRA.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0160.10
So, you think taking the availability of plans (coverages/deductibles/costs/prescription plans etc.) and dropping it down to one is more options?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0160.11
the rich don't need cobra, they can buy their own individual policy at any price...

I was just saying it out loud so others realize a single payer plan is not hospitals and doctors working for the government and them being on the govts payroll, as many on the right KEEP SAYING.

All the cons do is blah blah blah blah blah because they cannot talk objectively about the issue.

The health insurance industry raped the American public.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0169.3
It is now being castrated.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0169.4
Where we differ is that probably see Government as an innocent Bystander,where I view Government as the Silent Partner, or Conspirator.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.1
I don't see how you think this bill is a jump in to socialism...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.2
it falls WAY SHORT of anything like such....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.3
there is no take over...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.4
everything is still ALL DONE with the private sector....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.5
with their profits, with their every whim being met....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.6
we the people have lost, insurance companies have won big time....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.7
a gvt take over and single payer plan would be welcomed by me, in a heartbeat, compared to the assholes at the insurance companies....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.8
I'd take a medicare type plan that i paid in to, any day of the week over these suckers...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.9

If you would just read, you would see that it is designed to destroy the private insurance companies.

In five years they will be extinct or no more than puppet plans sponsored by the government and the government will have full control of the industry.

You would take a medicare plan that was funded on IOU's just like Social Security because you do not think about what our great grand children will have to play with in the future.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.22
there is NOTHING DESIGNED in this bill with the public insurance option to destroy the insurance companies out...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.23
stop LYING please...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.24
that is your opinion but that is FAR FROM FACT....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.25
I realize that you do not think you are lying, but it is a LIE none the less immie....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.26
it is NOT designed to bring the insurance companies down, it IS DESIGNED in the manner to give them ALL A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD so that true competition exists.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.27
The Public Option CAN NOT BE PAID FOR WITH TAXES...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.28
it says so in the legislation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.29
STOP STOP STOP NOW WITH THAT LIE...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.30
please, I have had enough of this lie, why?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.31
BECAUSE IT IS A LIE....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.32
The public option has NO ADVANTAGE GIVEN THEM by the government over the private sector....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.33
if the private sector fails, it fails because of what the private sector does to themselves, and I can assure you, they will NOT GO BELLY UP, WITHOUT A FIGHT.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.34
and that fight will entail the private insurance companies becoming MORE EFFICIENT themselves....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.35
THAT is the whole idea of the public option.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.36
This entire bill is NOT what i have come to believe is the way to go with our health care...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.37
I believe we should just go in to a single payer plan for all of us, paid for through the money we now spend on private insurance, via new taxes...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.38
yep, I have no faith in the insurance companies to bring the cost of health insurance down to an affordable level, especially WITHOUT the public insurance plan to keep them honest.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.39
The Public Option is set up that IT CAN NOT BECOME a SINGLE PAYER PLAN....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.40
Because the Plan holders all pay their own premium, the government does NOT PAY IT through taxes on them....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.41
So again, even if unintentional, what you keep saying about this Public Insurance Option as being DESIGNED to bring the insurance companies down, it's a lie....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.42
it is specifically designed to be COMPETITION, with no favors.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.43
Will it lead people to be happy with it and make them think that a single payer plan might be ok, somewhere down the road, someday?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.44
THAT may be the case...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.45
BUT if the public ever chose to go the route of a single payer insurer, IT WILL NOT BE THIS PUBLIC INSURANCE OPTION, IT CAN'T BE, according to the LEGISLATION because it was NOT DESIGNED TO BE..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.47
I'm not even going to read all that BS care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.48
The first sentence of the third paragraph was enough.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.49
Of course, the language does not specifically state that the intention of the plan is to eliminate private insurance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.50
You used to analyze the market for selling shoes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.51
Why don't you put your little brain to work and think about what exactly the language in hr3200 would do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.52
Is Congress going to come out and say, "it is our express goal to eliminate completely one large segment of the American Economy and put hundreds of thousands of individuals out of work"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.53
Hell no they are not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0170.54
But if you even tried to read the language, you would see that is what will happen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0183.1
Look here is the thing........
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0183.2

At the last company where I worked, one of the guys went out of our company plan, in which he was paying over $1,000 a month for family coverage, for a cheaper plan he obtained through the internet.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0183.22
Everything was fine until he came down with multiple sclerosis--no previous history or family history, but they soon cancelled his coverage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0183.23
They had no intention of taking care of someone who had so many medical needs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0183.24

We do have pre-existing conditions in my family that is covered.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0183.30
That caused the price to be more expensive than it would otherwise.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0183.31
So, you are saying that because I bought insurance through the mechanism of the Internet, that Blue Cross and Blue Shield purchased through that mechanism is different than Blue Cross purchased another way?

But, I'm sure your take on it is far superior, right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0184.26
I'm not wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850361_0184.27
But I don't expect the son of an insurance broker to acknowledge that the insurance companies have been fleecing the citizens of the US for decades.

So your mother got you a good price?

<a href="http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm">The Case for Universal Health Care in the United States</a>
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.2
Why doesnt the United States have universal health care as a right of citizenship?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.3
The United States is the only industrialized nation that does not guarantee access to health care as a right of citizenship.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.4
28 industrialized nations have single payer universal health care systems, while 1 (Germany) has a multipayer universal health care system like President Clinton proposed for the United States.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.5
Myth One: The United States has the best health care system in the world.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.6
Fact One: The United States ranks 23rd in infant mortality, down from 12th in 1960 and 21st in 1990
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.7
Fact Two: The United States ranks 20th in life expectancy for women down from 1st in 1945 and 13th in 1960
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.8
Fact Three: The United States ranks 21st in life expectancy for men down from 1st in 1945 and 17th in 1960.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.9
Fact Four: The United States ranks between 50th and 100th in immunizations depending on the immunization.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.10
Overall US is 67th, right behind Botswana
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.11
Fact Five: Outcome studies on a variety of diseases, such as coronary artery disease, and renal failure show the United States to rank below Canada and a wide variety of industrialized nations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.12
Conclusion: The United States ranks poorly relative to other industrialized nations in health care despite having the best trained health care providers and the best medical infrastructure of any industrialized nation
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.13
Myth Two: Universal Health Care Would Be Too Expensive · Fact One: The United States spends at least 40% more per capita on health care than any other industrialized country with universal health care
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.14
Fact Two: Federal studies by the Congressional Budget Office and the General Accounting office show that single payer universal health care would save 100 to 200 Billion dollars per year despite covering all the uninsured and increasing health care benefits.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.15
Fact Three: State studies by Massachusetts and Connecticut have shown that single payer universal health care would save 1 to 2 Billion dollars per year from the total medical expenses in those states despite covering all the uninsured and increasing health care benefits
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.16
Fact Four: The costs of health care in Canada as a % of GNP, which were identical to the United States when Canada changed to a single payer, universal health care system in 1971, have increased at a rate much lower than the United States, despite the US economy being much stronger than Canadas.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.17
Conclusion: Single payer universal health care costs would be lower than the current US system due to lower administrative costs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.18
The United States spends 50 to 100% more on administration than single payer systems.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.19
By lowering these administrative costs the United States would have the ability to provide universal health care, without managed care, increase benefits and still save money.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.20

The acid test of this plan will be this:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.27
If the Senate and the Congress vote to adopt this, they must also vote to dissolve the current plans that they are using and use only this plan as their medical coverage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8850948_0005.28

Seriously, should they pass national health care without an American debate I would not want to be one of them.

Why do conservatives advocate bureaucrats being between you & a doctor?...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.2
It's the same as the government being between you and a doctor with universal healthcare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.3
The only difference is the government will put all the competition out of business and then Americans will have only one provider.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.4
At least with our current system there is some competition.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.5
Funny how the private companies spend about 31 cents out of ever dollar on administration.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.6
Medicare spends about 3 cents.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.7
That's why the private companies can't compete...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.8
they're bloated.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.9
Nice liberal spin.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.10
Here's the truth:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.12
But like many core beliefs of the left, the claim that government-run health care has lower administrative costs than private care is just plain false.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.13
New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, for example, likes to cite data showing that Medicare only spends 3% of its total outlays on administrative costs compared to 14-22% for private care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.14
The numbers themselves are correct, but measuring administrative efficiency by a percentage of total costs is completely useless.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.15
Heritage fellow Robert Book explains:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.16
Imagine, for a moment, that Fred and Jane each have a credit card from a different bank.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.17
Fred charges $5,000 a month, and Jane charges $1,000 a month.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.18
Suppose it costs each bank $5 to produce and send a plastic credit card when the account is opened.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.19
That $5 administrative cost is a much lower percentage of Freds monthly charges than it is of Janes, but that does not mean Freds bank is more efficient.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.20
It is purely a mathematical artifact of Freds charging pattern, and it would be silly to compare the efficiency of bank operations on that basis.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.21
Yet that is how many analysts compare Medicare with private insurance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.22
A much more accurate way of capturing each systems true administrative costs is by a per-patient basis.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.23
When this is done, government-run health cares administrative costs are routinely higher than private care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.24
In the years from 2000 to 2005, Medicares administrative costs per beneficiary were consistently higher than that for private insurance, ranging from 5 to 48 percent higher, depending on the year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181105-8851168_0018.25
This is despite the fact that private-sector administrative costs include state health insurance premium taxes of up to 4 percent (averaging around 2 percent, depending on the state)an expense from which Medicare is exemptas well as the cost of non-claim health care expenses, such as disease management and on-call nurse consultation services.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0021.2
The media didn't touch this story.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0021.3
This was a HUUUGE event.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0021.4
For no apparent reason a group of black teenagers systematically started chasing and hitting white people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0021.5
Nothing in the media.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0021.6
A group of blacks dressed in uniform and carrying clubs outside a voting precinct and the racist liberals excused it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0021.7
I would have LOVED to see what would have happened if a group of white racist dressed in Aryan militaristic garb carrying clubs outside a voting precinct would have resulted in the media....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0021.8
it would have been headline news for weeks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0021.9
Or imagine a group of white teens attacking blacks coming out of a church or other gathering....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0021.10
a nuclear bomb could go off and you wouldn't have known it for the wall to wall coverage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0021.11
Both the media and liberals act in overt racism on a regular basis and then we have people like MarcATL trying to point the finger the other direction.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0021.12
What a tool.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0021.13
All those stories were covered both in print and on television.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0022.14
Yes local television.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0023.1
It's the biggest, hottest news story in media.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0023.2
Are they not a media company interesting in keeping the populate updated on the latest and greatest and hottest news?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0023.3
Any of you wager to guess why such little coverage for the biggest, most powerful media organization on the world?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0023.4
Fox is covering it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0023.5
All day yesterday and today.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0024.4
Because they're not part of the State run media, they are not an extension of the Obama re-election campaign.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0024.5
Thus, they weren't given orders to run the same race bait story over and over to stir up racial divisions more.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0024.6
Thats exactly what the Hussein wants, he wants the chaos, he wants the outrage to be rampant throughout society, and the main stream media is happy to oblige.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0025.8
Killings that are INVESTIGATED are big news(.)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0026.1
not
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.1
True..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.2
FOX is state run media.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.3
But it's not part of anything Obama is doing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.4
The Saudis run FOX.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.5
So, owning a 7% share of a company means they 'run' Fox....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.6
is that your assertion?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.7
Seriously?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.9
Sometimes, swallow, you take stupid to an rdean level.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.10
How can you not be embarrassed by that?

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.12
Or did you pull that out of your ass?

Shareholders
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.14
In August 2005 the Murdoch family owned only about 29% of the company.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.15
However, nearly all of these shares were voting shares, and Rupert Murdoch retained effective control of the company.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.16
Nonetheless, John Malone of Liberty Media had built up a large stake, with about half of the shares being voting shares.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.17
Therefore, in November 2006, News Corporation announced its intention to transfer its 38.5 per cent managing interest in DirecTV Group to John Malone's Liberty Media; in return it bought back Liberty's 16.3% shares in News Corp., giving Murdoch tighter control of the latter firm.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.18
[33] Murdoch sold 17.5 million class A shares in December 2007.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.19
[34] · Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al-Saud of Saudi Arabia, through his Kingdom Holding Company, owns 7% of News Corp.'s shares, making Kingdom Holdings the second largest shareholder.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.20
[35][36][37] · Years after when Elektra Records was absorbed in 2004, News Corporation owned half of the re-issues from the record label company.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.21

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0035.22
For the record, it is a Saudi, not 'the Saudis'.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0036.19
I think the story is on every media outlet.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0037.1
Maybe they were all at a Klan rally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0037.2
No, it was a pretty light turnout.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0038.14
I wasn't talking about the story.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0038.15
I was simply responding to bullshit from idiots with a single fact.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0038.16
'The Saudis' do not 'own' or 'run' Fox News.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0038.17
One Saudi owns 7% of shares in the company.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0038.18
I am bored with left wing hacks lying about this crap.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0039.1
What's really sad is the left wing crazies around here, lead by Marcatl, who are using the tragic murder of that young kid in Florida to bash Fox News.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0039.2
And out and out lying about the coverage too, Sheppard Smith has been talking about it for the better part of 45 minutes, and they've covering it all day.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0039.3
You guys have absolutely no creditability at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0040.4
It Marc was white and starting thread after thread defending Zimmerman, he'd be called a racist.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0040.5
And for good reason, in my opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0040.6
Marc is a racist.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0040.7
Sad but true.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0041.1
Oh wowza...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0041.2
Sheppard Smith talked about it for a WHOPPING ten minutes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0041.3
Big whoop!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0041.5
I'd still need to see a link to believe that tripe.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0055.8
How do you know Marc is not White?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0055.9
(Oh, and for the record, I am not a roasted turkey with an eerie resemblance to Michael Richards)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0055.10
He's not, if I am to believe what he has told me in the past.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0055.11
In fact, I believe he is of Caribbean descent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0055.12
He can correct me, of course.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0055.13
All in all, Marc can be a dick at times and I certainly let him know when he is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0055.15
But, I do respect his passion for equal rights.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0055.16
He's OK by me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0055.17
I think a lot of folks need to reign in their emotions more and look objectively at situations, but then not everyone can be as wonderful as I am.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0055.18
*joke*
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0055.19
(And, thank goodness they aren't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0055.20
Life would be very boring for me.)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0056.6
As I said, asswipe, he covered it for quite some time, I'd say for 45 minutes at a minimum.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0056.7
And the other news anchors covered it earlier in the day and you'll see it later too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0056.8
The truth is you don't believe it cuz you don't wanna believe it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0056.9
And that's fine, your entitled to whatever you wanna think.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0056.10
But don't be pretending you want a serious conversation minus any bias, cuz you can't offer the same.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0056.11
Why don't you tune into Fox News dipshit, and see for yourself?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0056.12
Might I suggest the lead story at or near the top of every fucking hour until O'Reilly shows up?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0056.13
I'm going to watch all the FOXNEWS shows tonight like a hawk.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0056.14
From what I've seen thus far, they've been a day late and a dollar short.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0056.15
Tepid and very light coverage when they did cover it...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0056.16
spinning it more like it's an opportunity for the Left to grab their second amendment rights away from them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0056.17
Better you than me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0056.19
MarcATL: taking one for the team!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0057.6
Maybe they just report the facts and don't waste time creating faux outrage without some legally sound facts to back it up?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0057.7
Maybe they don't want to whip up hatred for the sake of ratings?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0057.8
Maybe they don't like race baiting?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0057.9
Wipe your chin, Marc, you're drooling again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0057.10
Ok, lay off the sauce.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0057.11
This is FOXNEWS we're talking about.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0057.12
They whip up Obama hatred on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0057.13
Even their website stokes fear and hatred of Obama:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0057.15
Earlier, it had a story about Obama's trip to Oklahoma this morning to announce the pipeline construction, and their headline was "Obama's Pipe Dream".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0057.16
They are just not honest actors.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0057.17

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0057.19
She stinks to high-heaven of it.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0059.16
Well I watched FOXNEWS daily for like 14 - 16 of those months straight...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0059.17
I mean every show.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0059.18
It finally got to be too much, the hatred, the race-baiting, the racism, the outright lies...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0059.19
I fled and haven't turned back since.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0059.20
Hannity's the worst, he's like the FOXNEWS version of CalifornaGurl...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0059.21
he just lies so stinkin much.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0060.16

Sorta cringeworthy, I say.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0061.2

A single person's 7% interest in an entity does not equate to it being state run.

Even a hyper-partisan dunce like yourself should realize that although normally 7 is a low number in percentage, in ownership of companies such as FOXNEWS it reflects a large percentage of influence.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0087.14

He got FOX to scrub any references to Saudi cash backing Al Qaeda.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0087.17
Heck..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0087.18
even Bush scrubbed the Saudis from the 9/11 commission report.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0087.19
Saudis are the puppet masters of American conservatives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0088.16
And, the influence that it shows happened is that the Saudi's request to change the description of a protest as a Muslim one to a civil one was only done after it was confirmed that it was not just Muslim.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0088.17

It reminds me of when I was a child and my little brother would complain that someone else's cookie was microscopically larger than his.

We usually traded with him to stop the incessant whining about such non-consequential minutia.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0093.18
No, only a bit too much influence with Bush II.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0093.19
The US has ignored Saudi human abuses for decades; OIL is the reason.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0094.13

Just watched Shepard Smith.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0139.5
He had on an older heavy set white guy who apparently was the author of the law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0139.6
The guy who wrote it said this law does not apply.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0139.7
Then Shepard went on about a young teen who bought Skittles from a 7-11 and while unarmed, was walking back to his father while he was followed by an armed man who police told to stop following the kid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0139.8
The young teen is now dead and the killer is still walking around armed.

2 - I thought that in the past, you have claimed not to be a conservative, but an independent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0142.6
Discussing his injuries, how the killing "went down" indicates the killer is now the VICTIM.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0149.3
Btw it's not a white on black crime; the shooter is Hispanic and has blacks in his immediate family.

Interesting, since you just used WIKI as a source, but just a few months ago said this about WIKI:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0152.17
Seriously, you're citing 'wiki' as the absolute authority?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0152.19
You do know that it's not a source for unbiased, strictly fact based information, right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0152.20
I love busting you with your own words.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0163.17
Not 'busting' at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0163.18
I don't rate wiki, for the reasons I cited previously...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0163.19
it is too easy to abuse the editing system.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0163.20
Yet you run to wiki when it's conveniet.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0163.21
As I already stated.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0163.22
However, they are right...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0163.23
it is a 7% share.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0163.24
How do you know this, if Wiki is unreliable, as you claim?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0163.25
And, I know that other people find wiki acceptable...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0163.26
so I go with it....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0163.27
"other people" find MediaMatters, DailyKos and Moveon.org acceptable - do you use those, also?

That is why you're pissed.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0163.39
I am entertained that you trawled the site in a desperate need to 'prove' something that I would happily have conceded - had you just asked.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0165.12
But you just claimed that you were a conservative.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0165.13
Not "I am fiscally conservative", or "I have some things in common with conservatives" - you said "I'm a conservative".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0165.14
That's also dishonest.

Synthia, here is an easy rule of thumb for anyone with respect to using Wiki as a source:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0166.27
Sure, go to wikipedia, that's fine.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0166.28
If you find the info there that you need, check to see if it's cited to a separate source.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0166.29
If it is, check the source.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0166.30
If that is good, use it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0166.31
Easy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0166.32

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0167.8

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0167.9

For one thing, this area is majority black.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0201.7
If Zimmerman was going to target blacks, he'd be doing it every day all day.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0201.8
If he was a racist, he wouldn't be living there in the first place.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0201.9

George Zimmerman is hispanic, but BUT for purposes of accusation he's white.

You and the other race-baiters are trying to prove that with Fox not covering Trayvon (they are though), its viewers must be racist.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0235.9
The problem is, Fox has been covering the story and even the LW mouthpiece MSNBC has been covering other stories.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0235.10

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0235.17

I just learned that today was the first day Obama said anything about the Trayvon Martin story.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0238.2
Today.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0238.3
Interesting.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0239.1
And Fox News is covering this story.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0239.2
They're just not in a Race-Baiting feeding frenzy like the Liberal Press is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0239.3
They're actually being responsible journalists.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0239.4
As more evidence comes out, they will cover the story a bit more.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0239.5
Then why did HANNITY say the shooting was an accident?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0239.6
Why did fox and friends say it was the victims fault because he wore a hoodie?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0239.7
Please explain this?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0240.8
I actually listened to Hannity's radio show today and he said nothing of the sort.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0240.9
In fact he is all for getting to the bottom of this as quickly as possible...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0240.10
your assertion that Hannity is soft on this is WAY OFF Bud...

a simple google search will confirm what I say.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0241.8
What you didn't have in those cases were a police force that did a piss poor job of investigating a fatal shooting and a Jeb Bush local law that gave creeps like Zimmerman (with a record of being a 911 nusiance to the police AND a criminal record) credence to do what he did.

So either YOU are poor liar or incredibly ignorant as to what's going on around you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0243.18
What you had in Florida with Zimmerman was a 911 tape like this <a href="http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/videos/in-911-call-does-george-zimmerman-call-trayvon-martin-a-fing-coon">In 911 call, does George Zimmerman call Trayvon Martin a 'f***ing coon'?</a>

Come to think of it, that would include you, which might explain why you don't see it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0264.5
The police report indicated that Zimmerman had a cut on his head, the girlfriend said she heard some type of struggle over the phone before the shots, and there is even a witness that claims he saw that fight.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0264.6
All of that proves that Zimmerman told the police the truth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0264.7
What the police have to find out now is if Zimmerman instigated the confrontation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0264.8
If he did, he should face charges.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0264.9
If he was just following him to make sure he didn't break into a house somewhere in the neighborhood, and Martin actually initiated, and escalated, the confrontation, he shouldn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0264.10
Until I know the facts I won't make a decision.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0264.11
The "fight" was a result of Zimmerman PURPOSEFULLY CONFRONTING MARTIN WITH HIS PREJUDICE IDEALS....

Candy Crowley on CNN, their chief political correspondent, this AM asked Gov Scott of Florida why it "took more than a month to react?"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0270.2
Today is Sunday the 25th of March and the shooting took place on Sunday February 26th.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0270.3
That's 28 days ago which is now exactly a month ago, and the Gov appointed a special prosecutor and a task force to investigate on the 22nd.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0270.4

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0270.6
The reason that it took so long is that the Sanford Police investigated the incident and determined that Zimmerman's story checked out and they released him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0270.7
That should have been it but the parents of the boy weren't satisfied and then ONLY because Treyvon is black and they thought Zimmerman was white, did it become a major story.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0270.8
Now that it is, Gov.Scott is placating the hysterical lynch mob by having someone look into it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0270.9
the fact that after all that, Zimmerman is still a free man today makes me suspect that Zimmerman's story still checks out.

Prove it!

Because to date he was NOT given a blood alcohol test, foresnics as to the ballistics from his gun, nor was the 911 tape brought into question as to WHY did he pursue and confront Martin when he told not to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0277.21
So beyond a quick Q&A, what the hell happened?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0277.22
Was his gun even confiscated?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0277.23
(and how the hell does a guy with a record get a CCWP?)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0277.27
Who said anything about the CSI program, genius.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0277.28
Standard ballistic test to determine powder residue on victims and perps hands has been around for a LONG time, and is available to even the most remote precinct/station.

If they don't have it on the premises, they can send it to a regional one that does.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0277.30
and remember, it's was OVER A MONTH before the "main stream media" picked this up, which is MORE than enough time for proper police work to have taken place.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0277.32
Why don't you start thinking beyond the talking points that make you feel good?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0278.1
Aw, Liberal cretins are just pissed because Zimmerman is actually Hispanic.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0278.2
It kinda throws a wrench in their 'Evil Whitey kills Black Kid' Race-Baiting hysteria.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0278.3
Liberal Media Outlets like CNN & NBC are absolutely befuddled as to how to proceed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0278.4
First they called him 'White' and indicted the entire White Race.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0278.5
But now they're backpedaling and have become distraught.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0278.6
The Liberal Media is a joke.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0278.7
Period, end of story.

I am babbling about the facts, something that is strange to you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.13
Sorry, but your history on these threads demonstrate time and again what a quantum neocon gasbag you are.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.14
let's see if you can do better here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.15
The tape did not record his ideals, he didn't enunciate them to the operator.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.16
I have listened to the tapes, and the only slur it is possible to get out of the tape is ambiguous.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.17
Even if he said it, and was actually referring to Martin, it doesn't say anything about Zimmerman's ideals, it might.

however, be indicative of state of mind.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.23
Zimmerman makes all types of assumptions that DON'T coincide with additional information.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.24
Given his history of calls on "suspicious" black males that DID NOT PAN OUT, his state of mind is pretty evident....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.25
and he DID NOT have to pursue Martin.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.26
What matters is who started the fight, not why it started.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.27
If Martin turned around and called Zimmerman a honky and Zimmerman attacked him Zimmerman over reacted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.28
If Martin attacked Zimmerman because he was being followed, he over reacted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.29
Simple statements of fact,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.30
You're simple if you think your supposition and conjecture will pass the muster.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.31
Zimmerman INITIATED THE CONFRONTATION, as the tape clearly tells that he PURSUED Martin when it was NOT necessary or prompted by the cops.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.32
Referring to Martin as an "asshole" and a "fucking (coon?)"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0279.33
along with his generalize assumptions gives a clear indication of his mindset, whether YOU like it or not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0280.16
Are you really this fucking dense or are you just being obstinate?

Due process means exactly that.....

You shoot someone in a public area when there is serious question as to motive and cause, you should be arrested and taken in for questioning, drug testing, foresnics, etc.

Deal with it.

Pauly is STILL babbling in his ignorance regarding the true origin and definition of the word "hispanic".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0283.9
Zimmerman's own history of calls to the cops and the following set his mindset regarding racial prejudice
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0283.12

Have the FOXNEWS covered the latest news in the case...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0317.3
the video which shows that the killer, George Zimmerman doesn't appear to have a scratch or at least not anything indicating being hurt directly after being arrested?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0317.4
Did any of their actual news anchors covered it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0317.5
How about their pundits?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0317.6

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0317.7

I'm sure Satan answers prayers as well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0317.12
They didn't cover it yesterday.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0317.13
So they were an entire day late in a BIG news story.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0317.14
That is equivalent to like a week in the news business.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0317.15
And they're supposed to be the number one news network.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0317.16
Why is that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0317.17
Could it be that they were waiting to get their talking points and marching orders sorted out?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0317.18
Hmmmmm.....?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0317.19
So what did they say anyway?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0317.20
I'm curious to know.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0321.1
They showed the video just like all the other news did yesterday and then said that the video was to grainy to make any judgment and people should wait until the medical reports about it come out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0322.2
Ahhh....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0322.3

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0322.5
"it's too grainy, so we should wait."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0322.6
Of course they want to wait, that video is damning.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0335.1
It was on fox news Sunday.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0335.2
However it's a non story other than for political opportunists.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0336.1
I think the "bigger" story is, how many "leaders" that are for "racial equality" are demanding a lynching.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0336.2
I guess its okay if you are on the 'right' side of the rope?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0337.4
Why is this the biggest news story?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.1
Of course Bill Kristol thinks that it's much to do about nothing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.2
So he bashes the coverage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.3
He doesn't get it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.4
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/01/bill-kristol-trayvon-martin-media-coverage_n_1394815.html">Bill Kristol: Trayvon Martin Media Coverage Is 'Demagoguery' (VIDEO)</a>
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.5
Although this guy does...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.6
Kristol is partially correct, although probably not in the way he thinks.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.7
The thing about this case that has turned it into such a big story is that it is something different to everyone.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.8
To some it about racial profiling.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.9
To some it is police sweeping it under the rug.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.10
To some it is about the SYG law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.11
To some it is about concealed carry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.12
And the list goes on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.13
Some see it merely as a crime.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.14
Those on the right who hold different views don't have just one view either.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.15
Take what Scarborough said just the other day.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.16
He claimed it was NOT about SYG. Kristol says the opposite.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.17
What first made this a national case was that the police were not adequately investigating and were openly defending Zimmerman.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.18
The injustice of that drew everyone in. Kristol gets that part right..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.19
Where he goes wrong is in his assessment of the continued coverage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.20
It is far more complex than what he tries to claim.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.21
Part of the continued attention is countering the kneejerk claims of people who defended Zimmerman.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.22
For example, the faIse photos of Martin became an entire subset of stories.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.23
The police station video became a big story because it countered all of the claims of Zimmerman being severeIy beaten.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.24
Another aspect of the continued coverage is due to the genuine puzzlement that Zimmerman still remains uncharged in a situation where most people would have been charged.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.25
The slow trickling of information is another aspect that keeps this going.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.26
It took weeks to get the 911 calls and even longer to get the police station video.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.27
Various other information, such as police reports, came out at other times.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.28
Much of the information was due to independent investigation (that the police should have done) and thus came out as soon as it was available.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.29
All of this plays into the 24 hour news cycle.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0338.30
So, what we have is an emotional case that means something different to everyone, and a situation (brought on mostly by the police) where information is discovered in a way that perpetuates the story.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0339.1
Wow I dont watch FoxNews all day, but I turned it there and they had the story on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0339.2
Look just because Fox NEws doesnt bend over for democrats and Obama doesnt mean they are anywhere as right as the main media is left.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0339.3
Stop with the talking points.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0339.4
Instead of bashing FoxNews, who doesnt edit 911 tape to change the story, light rockets under gas tanks to get trucks to explode, tout false documents as real, hire just democrats, fire john stossel just because he wasnt a liberal anymore.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0339.5
I could go on, but I think you get the point, those are some of the things off the top of my head that our "objective" media have done, funny how none of those "errors" favor the right, hmmmmmm
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0340.31
No it's you who does not get it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0355.1
Trayvon's father doesn't deserve any blame at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0355.2
Why didn't Trayvon call his father and say "get out here and take this yahoo off my ass" instead of calling his girlfriend.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0355.3
Who knows?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0355.4
thats a good question but the boy is dead now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0355.5
Which is a real shame that this family has had their son taken from them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0355.6
What I find troubling is that acting thug is a survival instinct in the "hood".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0355.7
Many kids who aren't at all thugs feel that they have to at least act like one to survive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0355.8
There is a chance that non-thug Trayvon went street rat on a man he assumed to be unarmed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0355.9
Maybe it worked in the past.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0355.10
In states that have these kinds of stand your ground laws, it is best to assume that everyone is armed and willing to use a weapon in the event of a threat.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0355.11
When "hello" becomes "declare your intent" we will be well on our way to sanity, just as it was in the very beginning when all men had swords and bows.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0355.12
Well acting like a "thug" is not just something you see in the hood anymore, thanks to the world wide spread of hip hop culture you see people acting like that everywhere, I have seen white kids in Iowa wearing doo rags and sagging their pants, believe it or not I have seen Arab teenagers acting like this in Kuwait and using the word "nigga" to each other, this is hardly specific for just Blacks anymore, keep in mind people won't act the way they were as teenagers for ever, when I was 17 I listened to hip hop, I had braids in my junior year of high school, I had a 15 year old girlfriend with a 1 year old baby, and I went by the nick name "Lil Al Capone", why do you ask?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0355.13
Al Capone was my hero as a teen and I looked up to him, now fast forward 13 years later, I did 7 years in the US Military, was deployed twice to the Middle East, and I now have a good job working the government as a Civilian, I have a clean arrest sheet, I was only arrested once for punching a guy in the face who tried to go behind the bar and attack the female bartender, once the police reviewed the rapes I was released with no charge.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0355.14
The life I am living now is completely different than the one I had at 17.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.1
Why was Trayvons body laying 12 hours in the Morgue?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.2
Why didn't his father report him missing before he did?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.3
Where was Trayvons Father when Trayvon needed him the most less than 1000 feet away.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.4
These are all questions that the Sanford PD will have to answer and account for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.5
There's no excuse why they bungled this up so horribly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.6
I know of only one reason how this could have happened.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.7
Marc why was Trayvon's body not claimed from the morgue until 12 hours after his death?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.8
Why didn't the father at least look out his window when all the shouting was taking place?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.9
Where was the father when the shot was fired not more than a 1000 feet away?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.10
The distance is my guesstamation but the fight wasn't far from where Trayvon's father lived.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.11
That is something news worthy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.12
Title of the news story · Where was Trayvon's Father when his son needed him the most?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.13
how is this relevant?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.14
Don't blame the father.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.15
Fuck you and fuck marc race baiting son of a bitch.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.16
Where the fuck was the father who sons less than 1000 feet away was dying?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.17
Why did it take the father so long to report his son was missing?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.18
After all his son had been suspended for 10 days from school.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.19
Marc seems to this there should be more news reporting about Trayvon don't bitch about it when someone ask these questions because the longer this goes with media attention the more Trayvon will not look like an angel but a child who did not have any parental guidance
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0356.20

They are clearly pushing an agenda.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0357.3
Why is the Zimmerman defense team grinding away at the deceased victim, Trayvon Martin, unleashing a smear campaign the likes that have never before been seen this century?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0358.5
W know, because for those who have followed the story, the father was out to dinner with his fiance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0358.6
When they arrived, they used the front entrance, and wouldn't have even seen any aftermath hours later (if there were any) in the common backyard.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0358.7
He very likely just assumed his child was in bed, sleeping.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0358.8
The very next morning was when he called in a missing persons report.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0358.9
The idiot bigfatrebel is still blowing copious amounts of shit out of his ass.

For those who need to see how the layout was, and where Trayvon's fiance's house was in relation to the shooting, here:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0363.20
Trayvon being in the morgue for 12 hours is not the fault of Sanford PD. Trayvon did not have an ID.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0363.21
So why didn't the father call the PD and report his son was missing?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0363.22
Did he allow Trayvon to stay out as long as Trayvon wanted too?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0364.4
More media attention, and more media, period.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-15949161_0364.5
More TV channels, internet, mobile phones, etc. etc.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0011.1
He apologized?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0011.2
Oh man..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0011.3
that must have been serious.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0011.4
If you want to call that an apology.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0011.5
I wouldn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0011.6
I agree.

I did not mean a personal attack on Ms. Fluke.

I think it is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times, we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of Congress.

I personally do not agree that American citizens should pay for these social activities.

Truth is, you (what a F'in high roller you are, too!) are just individually too cheap to pay for birth control for the women in your life.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0103.8
Gawd, Chris, you are an ENTITLED one...............
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0104.1
With everything going on in the world.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0104.2
The media has spent 2 weeks on this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0104.3
And it all started at the WH when this · administration tried to get the Catholic church · to pay for birth control...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0104.4
Like they had no idea the Church would respond as it did....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0104.5
Paleeeeze...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0104.6
Give me a break.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0104.7
This was designed by Axelrod and the rest running � the President's campaign.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0104.8
and the Republicans walked right into the trap, didn't they?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0104.9
And I said it was a trap two weeks ago, and no one on the right listened to me, did you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0104.11
I'm seriously considering making that my Avi, as it seems to be where the GOP is these days.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0105.17
Still stronger than the apologies from the dolts who saddled this nation with the pretender in the White House.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0106.5
And where's your supremely intelligent hero Sarah Palin these days?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0106.6
A REAL leader would be running for president.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0106.7
"Where's Sarah?"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0106.8
is the adult equivalent of "Where's Waldo?"

I am NOT making that up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.1
How can you Republicans think you have a chance this November?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.2
Because nit-twits like you think the voting public will digest liberal illogic/lies, hook, line, and sinker.

P.S. -Also, get back to us on gas prices come September.

Look at you righties and your treasonist thoughts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.6
I know we are in an election year but you treasonist bastards have admitted that your number one priority is to make Obama a one term president, and so it is very obvious to anyone with a brain that the GOP have been sabotaging the recovery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.7
That is why their approval numbers are at 8% and Obama's approval numbers are growing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.8
Now you admit the corporations that rule our nation are going to play politics with Iran and Oil Prices?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.9
And we are going to put Romney or Santorum in office because the rich own our government?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.10
Wasn't it Bush that put Alito and Roberts in the Supreme Court?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.11
We can't afford to go any more to the right buddy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.12
The right have thrown women onto the list of people they have offended?

This is going to be fun.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.14
Gas.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.15
Obama will handle that just like he handles everything else.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.16
With class.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.17
I am not kidding here you scum.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.18
I think you righties are fucking horrible people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.19
Hoping gas prices go up?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.20
And then you say corporations aren't corrupt?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.21
LOL.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0133.22
If we were in another civil war, I'd have no problem going to war with Americans like you.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0134.2
The man apologized.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0134.3
Case closed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0134.4
Move on weirdos.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0134.5
I never said Rush should apologize.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0134.6
He has a first amendment right to say whatever he wants.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0134.7
No matter how ugly or assinine.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0134.8
My complaint is that the GOP let itself get suckered into this trap.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0134.9
Which I guess is inevitable when you have a political strategy based on playing on people's religion to get them to vote against their own economic interests, sometimes you have to pretend you care about the silly religious shit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0134.10
He does not have the righ to slander a private citizen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0134.11
Does Rush do much BUT slander?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0135.23
With Americans like you, I'd first try to go through our failing political system, before I'd take up arms against you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0135.24
But that is because I know first hand that most of us Americans have more in common (freedom, liberty, justice), then less in common; when all is said and done outside of our claustrophobic two-party corporatist plutocracy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0135.25
War not good.........................
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0135.26

Seriously, Chris....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0136.5
you have a conversation with republicans about every issue you post on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0136.6
Do you realize just how foolish you sound?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0136.7
I really doubt any republican in their right mind would take you serious enough to carry a conversation with you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0137.4
Republican or Democrat, any girl not smart enough to get BC from Planned Parenthood DESERVES the consequences of her STUPIDITY.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0137.5
My God, this issue is NOT about access to birth control, you can get it almost ANYWHERE for FREE!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0137.6
This issue is about forcing unwilling people to PAY for it, one fucking way or another!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0150.7
Wait a minute.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0150.8
Clearly by your comment you were in favor of cutting funding to Planned Parenthood, and now you want to use it as a source women can use to get free birth control?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0150.9
Are you sure Planned Parenthood still exists after all the cuts/changes the GOP made during the Debt Ceiling fiasco?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0150.10
Now listen and listen good.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0150.11
Free market For Profit PRIVATE insurance companies did a cost analysis on birth control and decided it would save them money if they provide contraception as preventative medicine.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0150.12
Much cheeper than paying for a child birth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0150.13
So you aren't paying for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0150.14
Its saving you money.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0150.15
Stop paying for contraceptives and watch your healthcare costs rise.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0150.16
Facts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0150.17
So sort of goes against your GOP theory huh?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0150.18
Georgetown will NOT run a cost analysis I bet.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0151.1
Even back to the oldie days when they talked about Thomas Jefferson's mistress or slandered Andrew Jackson's wife.

*************************************** � Edith Wilson took a lot of heat also; she accepted it like a woman, and the JOB.

Edith Wilson kind of had it coming.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0151.4
What she did, essentially, keeping the Vice President and Congress in the dark about Wilson's incapacity, was reprehensible and had terrible consequences for the country.

******************************************* � What nation do you reside in?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0153.7
The keyword is 'force'.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0153.8
It is obvious that liberals like S-Bobo are control freaks whom want to impose their beliefs on all others through force, since they worship at the altar of Government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0153.9
But isn't this the purest expression of Liberalism?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0154.1
Looks like the Left is just pissy because they can't beat this dead horse anymore.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0154.2
The man apologized.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0154.3
And that's more than hateful Left nutters ever do.

It's over.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0154.5

Well, actually, he does.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.8
She stopped being a "private citizen" the minute she got up in front of Congress and testified and took a political stand.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.9
Then she became a "political activist", which is pretty much stepping up into the dunk-tank of public opinion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.10
Not saying this is "right" or even "good".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.11
In fact, I suspect a lot of people who would make good leaders stray away from politics because of EXACTLY this sort of thing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.12
But it's part and parcel of our system.

Actually, no she didn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.17
Public figure is a legal term applied in the context of defamation actions (libel and slander) as well as invasion of privacy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.18
A public figure (such as a politician, celebrity, or business leader) cannot base a lawsuit on incorrect harmful statements unless there is proof that the writer or publisher acted with actual malice (knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth[1] ).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181106-8868578_0155.19
The burden of proof in defamation actions is higher in the case of a public figure.
