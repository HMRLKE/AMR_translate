Lucio Stanca stated that the world must solve the problem of world hunger, disease and education but in order to do that the world must first help create good governance.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20020808_0105.18
The rationale behind creating good governance is that by making the public administration of developing countries more transparent and accountable developing countries would become more attractive potential recipients of traditional forms of aid such as loans and investments.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20020808_0105.19
In effect good governance would invalidate the reason used by countries that do not do enough that donating is not appropriate because it is impossible to know whether the aid would reach its true destination.

International Atomic Energy Agency director ElBaradei says the biggest danger facing the world is not new nuclear States but the risk of extremist groups obtaining atomic weapons.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080209_0664.5
Director General of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed ElBaradei told a conference of the world's top defense officials on 080209 that the biggest danger facing the world is not new nuclear States but the risk of extremist groups obtaining atomic weapons.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080209_0664.6
ElBaradei urged a reduction of the world's nuclear stockpile and better controls and said that an extremist group would use nuclear weapons upon procuring such weapons.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080209_0664.7
ElBaradei said that even countries which have nuclear weapons know that a country which uses nuclear weapons will be pulverized but that extremist groups will use nuclear weapons if possible.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080209_0664.8
ElBaradei said that countries need to be aware that extremist groups procuring nuclear weapons is the number one security threat the world is facing and added as a note of caution that given the state of the system of international controls it was hard to determine whether nuclear materials were ending up with extremist groups.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080209_0664.9
ElBaradei said much of the material that is reported stolen is never recovered and that a lot of the material recovered has never been reported stolen.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080209_0664.10
ElBaradei said in reference to Iran that the international community should quickly engage in talks with the Iranian government to secure guarantees that the Iranian nuclear program will not be used to develop weapons and that such confidence can only be built through direct negotiations.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080209_0664.11
U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman said that Iran remained the world's top arms control challenge and that it would be a profound mistake to focus on the recent U.S. national intelligence estimate that suggested Iran no longer had a nuclear weapons program.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080209_0664.12
Lieberman pointed out that in the Nie report which said that the Iranian government's covert work on bomb design may have been temporarily suspended in 03000 it was also and far more importantly stated that Iran's overt work on enrichment continues apace.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080209_0664.13
German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier similarly emphasized that the Nie report in no way grants Iran any kind of absolution.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080209_0664.14
Germany has been working with the 5 permanent U.N. Security Council members on the Iranian nuclear issue.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080209_0664.15
Steinmeier consequently believes it is right for the international community to keep up the pressure on Iran.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080209_0664.16
Steinmeier said that in the interests of global safety the international community's common goals must continue to be to prevent Iranian nuclear armament and to counteract the erosion of the Nonproliferation Treaty.

Reyes was killed on 080301 in a raid into Ecuador that has generated intense international criticism.

The poorly written communication addressed to Reyes was dated 080216 and was signed by Edgar Tovar.

Santos said Tovar commands a FARC front near Ecuador.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080306_0007.15
Tovar wrote that a man named Belisario in Bogota supplies Tovar with explosives and sent Tovar a catalog and specifications.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080306_0007.16
Tovar wrote that Belisario proposed to sell each kilo at US $2.5 million and deliver it and that Tovar and Reyes would then find a buyer.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080306_0007.17
Tovar wrote the deal would be with a Government and to sell them a sizable amount.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080306_0007.18
Tovar wrote Belisario had 50 kilos ready and could sell a lot more as Belisario had direct contact with uranium suppliers.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080306_0007.19
The uranium reference in Tovar's writing was quickly cited by Colombia's government while seeking to deflect criticism over the raid.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080306_0007.20
Gen. Oscar Naranjo said at an explosive news conference that the FARC mentioning negotiations for 50 kilos of uranium means that the FARC are taking big steps in the world of terrorism to become a global aggressor and were not just domestic guerrillas but transnational terrorists.

It wasn't clear what exactly the material Tovar was writing about might be.

Santos said the uranium mentioned in the communication sounded like processed uranium.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080306_0007.26
The price mentioned suggests that the uranium would be processed and hence dangerous.

PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.6
The Security Council resolution calls on all States to fully implement a Security Council resolution adopted in 040400 requiring all 192 United Nation Member States to adopt laws to prevent non-State actors from acquiring nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.7
The Security Council resolution notes that some unnamed countries have not filed a report on the member nations efforts to adopt these laws.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.8
The report was due to the United Nations in 041000.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.9
The 080425 Security Council resolution stresses the need to enhance the coordination of national, regional and international efforts to strengthen a global response to the serious challenge of keeping weapons from terrorists and the threat to international security.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.10
The 040400 Security Council resolution was adopted to close a loophole in global efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.11
International treaties targeted weapons proliferation by Governments until Resolution 1540 was adopted in 040000 there was no legal instrument to prevent terrorists, criminal scientists, black marketeers and other non-State actors from obtaining weapons of mass destruction.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.12
Resolution 1540 was introduced as the International Atomic Energy Agency was investigating a vast black market in nuclear equipment and technology.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.13
The black market investigation was encouraged by Pakistan's admission in 040200 that Pakistan's leading nuclear scientist had passed technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.14
Pakistan's leading nuclear scientist, was Abdul Qadeer Khan.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.15
Resolution 1540 requires all countries to adopt laws to prevent non-State actors from manufacturing, acquiring or trafficking in nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, the materials to make them, and the missiles and other systems to deliver them.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.16
Resolution 1540 requires all countries to take measures to account for and secure these weapons, missiles and other weapons material.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.17
Resolution 1540 also demands that countries develop border controls and step up law enforcement efforts to detect, deter, prevent and combat the illicit trafficking and brokering of weapons of mass destruction.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.18
All countries were required to submit a report within 6 months to a Security Council committee monitoring implementation of esolution 1540.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.19
The resolution adopted on 080425 extends the Resolution 1540 Committee's mandate until 110425 and again calls upon all States that have not yet presented a first report on steps the States have taken or intend to take to implement Resolution 1540 to submit such a report to the 1540 Committee without delay.

PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.22
The Security Council stated that not all States have presented to the Resolution 1540 Committee the state's national reports on implementation of Resolution 1540 and that the full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States is a long-term task that will require continuous efforts at national, regional and international levels.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080425_1111.23

A leading arms expert stated that China's improved nuclear arsenal raises questions about the Chinese government's future arms control efforts.

PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.6
A leading arms expert stated on 8 May 2008 that Chinese government is making dramatic improvements to China's nuclear arsenal which raises questions for future arms control efforts.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.7
Director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Bates Gill spoke at a panel for journalists while on a visit to Beijing to promote an annual report on the global arms industry.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.8
Gill stated --
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.9
Recent upgrades have increased the accuracy and mobility of China's arsenal while a switch from liquid to solid fuel has shortened reaction times.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.10
China stands out due to the effort to modernize, expand and improve nuclear weapons capability.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.11
Among the 5 nuclear Powers China is making the most dramatic improvements in nuclear force which raises arms control questions.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.12
The Chinese Government stated China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict and China's arsenal, estimated at just over 100 nuclear-armed missiles, is the smallest of the 5 main nuclear weapon Powers.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.13
Chinese officials signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1992 and gill stated the recent steps are aimed mainly at reducing the vulnerability of China's deterrent force.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.14
Gill stated that improvements in China's conventional military are even more dramatic after more than 10 years of double-digit percentage increases in annual defense spending.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.15
Gill stated the large increase in the military capability of China is targeted mostly at Taiwan but has the possibility going forward with force projection elsewhere.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.16
Taiwan is a self-governing island that China claims is part of China's territory and has threatened to invade.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.17
Gill stated that the increase in military capability complicates the issue of China as a player in the arms control agenda and that the Chinese government would need to be engaged in future efforts to cap or reduce numbers of nuclear weapons.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.18
Gill praised Beijing officials for decreasing sales of weapons and military technology abroad which Gill believes was largely done out of a desire to be viewed as a more responsible player in international society.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.19
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute China has only a 2 percent share of the global arms export trade.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.20
Gill stated that the shift in the way the Chinese government views the problem of nonproliferation is very positive.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.21
Gill stated that authorities need to strengthen regulation to prevent weapons from entering conflict zones, particularly in Africa where Chinese arms are used by both government and rebel forces in Sudan's Darfur region.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.22
Retired People's Liberation Army Colonel Teng jianqun spoke alongside Gill on the panel and stated that China has substantial restrictions on weapons sales abroad.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.23
Teng conceded that some dealers violated the rules and were beyond the Government's direct control.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.24
Teng stated that further steps were being taken to boost awareness of the rules, partly through courses for government and defense industry leaders run by the foreign ministry-sponsored China Arms Control and Disarmament Association of which Teng is Deputy Secretary-General.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080508_0562.25

Japan's lower house APPROVES BILL allowing use of space programs in national defense.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080513_0501.5
The legislation is the most recent effort by Japan to ascribe more freedom to its tightly controlled military and would overturn a ban on the military use of space.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080513_0501.6
On 13 May 2008 Japan's powerful lower house of parliament voted to allow Japan's space programs to be utilized for national defense.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080513_0501.7
The legislation is the most recent effort by Japan to ascribe more freedom to the tightly controlled military technically known as a self-defense force.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080513_0501.8
The legislation is expected to be approved by the upper house.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080513_0501.9
The legislation is primarily aimed at permitting military use of Japan's civilian-controlled spy satellite network for defense as defined by the pacifist constitution.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080513_0501.10
The bill states that space development has become increasingly important.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080513_0501.11
The bill states that space programs must contribute to ensure peace and safety of international society as well as the national security of Japan.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080513_0501.12
The bill does not specify how the programs will be utilized but the satellite network and other assets could potentially be used for surveillance, planning and for a missile defense shield Japan is constructing with the United States.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080513_0501.13
The bill would overturn a ban on the military use of space imposed on Japan's nascent space program in 1969.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080513_0501.14
The U.S.-drafted 1947 Constitution prohibits Japan from offensive warfare.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080513_0501.15
The legislation stipulates that all members of the cabinet and not just education, science and technology ministers will be responsible for Japan's future space projects.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080513_0501.16
Inclusion of the defense minister in decisions on space programs introduces the possibility for the military to possess and develop spy satellites.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080513_0501.17
The legislation would establish a special space task force led by the Prime Minister and create the new post of space development minister.

Topol-M missiles are capable of hitting targets more than 10000 kilometers or 6000 miles away.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080515_0931.21
The missiles are deployed in both silo-based and truck-mounted versions.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080515_0931.22
Strategic missiles forces chief General Nikolai Solovtsov stated that the Topol-M is a new step in missile design.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080515_0931.23
Vladimir Putin and other officials have boasted about the Topol-M's ability to penetrate any prospective missile defense.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080515_0931.24
Yuri solomonov designed the missile and stated that the missile drops engines at a significantly lower altitude than earlier designs which makes it hard for an enemy's early warning system to detect the launch.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080515_0931.25
Yuri solomonov stated that the missiles' warhead and decoys closely resemble one another in flight, making it very difficult for a foe to select the real target from a multitude of false ones.

Expert states that Iranian missile launch photo was doctored to show failed 4th missile launching.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080710_1336.5
20080710 director of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies's non-proliferation program and former US State Department official Mark Fitzpatrick stated that an Iranian photograph showing a cluster of missile launches from a desert range was altered to add a 4th missile.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080710_1336.6
The image was posted 20080709 on the Sepah news site, which is run by Iran's Revolutionary Guards.

20080710 the image was replaced with an image of the same 3 missiles in the previous photo but in place of the 4th missile is a grounded missile and what appears to be a vehicle nearby.

20080710 the image with 4 launches was absent from Sepah's main page but both images were in the archive.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080710_1336.9
Fitzpatrick stated that the photo was probably manipulated to obscure the failure of the 4th missile in order to maintain the impact of Iran's demonstration of power.

Iranian officials did not immediately comment on the photos.

Iranian officials stated that the enhanced Shahab-3 missile has a range of 1250 miles and thus could reach Israel and the majority of the Middle East.

Prosecutors in southern Russia's Astrakhan region across the Caspian Sea from Iran have sent the case against ANAR Godzhayev to court.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080717_0594.9
The metal in question is tantalum.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080717_0594.10
Tantalum can be used in the production of chemical processing equipment, nuclear reactors and missile parts and is subject to export restrictions under Russian law.

Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world's opium.

Opium production in Afghanistan has increased since the U.S.-led invasion removed the Taliban regime in 2001.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080728_0937.9
Officials in the American-backed government and Taliban militants are believed to profit from the illicit trade.

PROXY_APW_ENG_20080728_0937.11
Afghanistan's representative for the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime Christina Oguz stated the conversion of opium resin into heroin is increasingly being done inside Afghanistan mostly at laboratories in the border regions in the insurgency-plagued South and the East.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080728_0937.12
Oguz stated to reporters in Kabul that evidence of higher quality Afghan heroin indicates that the people running the labs are getting assistance from chemists who have come from outside the country as foreign consultants.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080728_0937.13
Oguz stated the chemists originated from countries near the border but did not detail specific countries.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080728_0937.14
Oguz stated the chemicals needed to make the heroin were being smuggled from China, South Korea, European countries, including Russia, and other parts of the world.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080728_0937.15
Oguz stated the so-called precursor chemicals such as acetic anhydride also have legal uses including in the paint and pharmaceutical industries.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080728_0937.16
Oguz stated the chemicals often are legally exported but later diverted to Afghanistan for illicit goals and Afghanistan has no major legal industries that would require such chemicals.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080728_0937.17
Oguz stated --
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080728_0937.18
Blaming Afghanistan alone for the heroin problem in the world is not correct.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080728_0937.19
Afghanistan does produce the opium which is the raw material for heroin but it is not possible to make heroin without certain chemicals that are not produced inside Afghanistan and are smuggled into Afghanistan.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080728_0937.20
More than 200 tons of the chemicals have been seized by Afghan authorities since 2006 but some 13000 tons were needed based on 2007's opium production figures.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080728_0937.21
The figures suggest the confiscated amount represented a small fraction of the total smuggled in.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080728_0937.22
Most seizures of the chemicals occur along the eastern border with Pakistan but a good deal comes via the western border with Iran.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080728_0937.23
Oguz stated the international community should share more information on known smugglers of the chemicals who were long-established and based in Afghanistan's neighboring countries.

The European Union's highest court on September 3, 2008 overturned a 2001 decision by European Union governments to freeze the assets of a Saudi businessman and a Sweden-based charity suspected of funding Al-Qaida terror groups.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080903_0510.6
The ruling conflicts with a United Nations anti-terror order obliging United Nations Member States to freeze assets of people and entities suspected of funding terror groups.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080903_0510.7
The European Union's highest court also stated that the United Nations order failed to offer individuals on a terror blacklist or individuals on the defense any legal rights to a judicial review under European law.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080903_0510.8
The European Union's highest court acknowledged that the reasons for freezing the assets of Yasin Al-Qadi and the Al-Barakaat International Foundation may be justified.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080903_0510.9
It is not known whether European Union nations which have set up a joint terror blacklist will unfreeze the assets.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080903_0510.10
None of the groups have so far been officially removed from the blacklist because European Union Governments argue the court rulings do not oblige the European Union nations to remove the names from the list but only force the European Union to inform the individuals and groups on the list that the assets have been frozen.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080903_0510.11
Head of the Saudi-based Muwafaq Foundation Yasin Al-Qadi appealed against the European Union's decision to freeze proprietary assets.

PROXY_APW_ENG_20080903_0510.16
Thomas Olsson also stated that the lawyers for Al-Barakaat International have to examine the judicial consequences of the verdict as the sanctions remain on a United Nations level.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080903_0510.17
The European Union's highest court stated on September 3, 2008 that the 27-nation European Union is required to inform any person whose assets are being frozen why as swiftly as possible after the decision is taken in order to allow the person with frozen assets the right to legal recourse.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080903_0510.18
Swedish lawyer Thomas Olsson who represented Al-Barakaat in the case approved of the ruling.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080903_0510.19
This ruling may hinder international efforts to stop the financing of terror groups including al-Qaida.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080903_0510.20
The ruling overturns an earlier 2005 European Union court decision that rejected the appeals of Al-Qadi and the Al-Barakaat international foundation.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20080903_0510.21
The ruling stated that the lower European Union's court judgment erred in law by stating that European Union courts had no jurisdiction to review the legality of the contested order to freeze assets of individuals and groups deemed to be funding terror groups by the United Nations.

Greece, Turkey and Belarus should have destroyed a total of nearly 7.5 million land mines by 080300.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20081121_1082.9
The 1155-page annual report by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines said Greece mentioned legal problems with contracting a company to carry out the destruction and the difficulty of finding environmentally safe destruction sites as reasons for the delay.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20081121_1082.10
Turkey's government claimed preparations for getting rid of Turkish stockpiles took longer than planned.

The report said only 500000 mines were destroyed worldwide over the past year but said Afghanistan, Burundi and Sudan got rid of all of stockpiles respectively.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20081121_1082.16
The report said the number of destroyed stockpiled mines since the treaty to ban land mines came into force in 990000 has been brought to more than 42 million but that 44 countries still have 176 million mines.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20081121_1082.17
All of the 156 countries that have joined the Treaty are given 4 years to destroy their stockpiles.

Major users of land mines such as the U.S., Russia and China have not signed the Treaty.
PROXY_APW_ENG_20081121_1082.19
The report said more than 1400 people were killed and 3900 wounded by land mine explosions worldwide in 070000 and added the number may be much higher because reporting is poor in many countries.

Taiwanese Vice President Annette Lu warned that European transfer of European technology to the People's Republic of China could encourage the PRC government to invade Taiwan.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040212_0013.5
Taiwanese Vice President Annette Lu warned on 040212 that the transfer of European technology to the People's Republic of China could encourage the PRC government to invade Taiwan.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040212_0013.6
Lu noted that the European Union adopted a resolution to ban arms sales to mainland China after the Tiananmen massacre of 890000 and said it is worrisome that the leaders of France and Germany are reportedly seeking to lift the ban following years of commercial interest enticements by the PRC government.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040212_0013.7
Lu expressed concern that European advanced technology will be transferred to the mainland and added that such transfers would be helpful for the PRC government's military buildup and will therefore encourage an invasion of Taiwan by the mainland.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040212_0013.8
Lu said that the government of mainland China has tried to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and has been increasing its military buildup against Taiwan.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040212_0013.9
Lu said the PRC government has deployed around 500 missiles targeting Taiwan and the number of missiles deployed is expected to increase to 650 next year.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040212_0013.10
Lu described the PRC government as a real international terrorist because of the threat of missiles aimed at Taiwan and the PRC's preparations to invade Taiwan.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040212_0013.11
Lu added that this is why Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian called for a peace referendum for 040320 alongside the Taiwanese presidential election.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040212_0013.12
Lu said European nations should not join the PRC government in opposing Taiwan's planned referendum.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040212_0013.13
Lu said that Taiwan is not a part of the People's Republic of China and has maintained substantive relations with almost all countries around the world even though most of them do not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040212_0013.14

A delegation of Taiwanese legislators completed an 11-day fact-finding trip to the United States.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.6
The Taiwan Executive Yuan submitted a NT $610.8 billion (US $18.23 billion) special budget to buy 388 Patriot PAC-III missiles, 8 conventional submarines and 12 P-3 C anti-submarine aircraft from the United States earlier this month.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.7
The budget is now pending approval by the Legislative Yuan.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.8
Ker Chien-ming, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) whip at the Taiwan legislature said on 040628 that discussions are turning negative in regard to whether the China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) should take part in the construction of submarines which the United States has promised to sell to Taiwan.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.9
Navy Commander-in-Chief Miao Yung-Ching called on the Legislative Yuan to communicate on the review of the arms procurement budget of which the submarine deal is a part.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.10
Miao said it is not feasible for CSBC to take part in the construction of the submarines and that the Navy will negotiate with the United States on obtaining repair capacity and technology transfers.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.11
Miao said that no countries want to buy conventional submarines.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.12
This would make it futile to give the CSBC the capacity to build them.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.13

PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.14
Lee Wen-chung is another DPP legislator who has been involved.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.15
Lee said on 040628 that the delegation asked the United States to shorten the delivery period of the submarines from 15 years to 10 years.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.16
This indicates that Taiwan has already given up the policy of building the submarines itself.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.17
Lee said that if the submarines are not built by Taiwan then the cost of the eight subs will be NT $100 billion less than the original plan of NT $400 billion.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.18
Lee's figures were based on the price tags of submarines sold from Germany and Spain along with the cost of obtaining repair capacity.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.19
Lee was asked if the long delivery period of 10 years might affect Taiwan's military strength and tip the military cross-Taiwan Strait balance toward mainland China after 050000.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.20
Lee answered that any possible naval military balance tilting toward the PRC after 050000 would not mean an eruption of war at that time.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.21
Lee claimed that Taiwan still enjoys the edge in the air.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.22
Lee added that an order of Kidd-class destroyers due to arrive at Taiwan by the end of next year would allow Taiwan to still maintain its edge.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20040628_0015.23
Lee also said that the United States will deliver the first 5 of 12 P-3 C aircraft in 080000, with another 3 in 090000, 4 in 100000 and the final 4 in 110000.

China's military budget has grown in recent years leading some to believe that China is attempting to achieve global dominance.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20070304_0025.5
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman and Taiwan's top China policy planner Joseph Wu stated on March 4, 2007 that China's substantial military budget increase of 17.8 percent reveals an attempt at achieving global dominance.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20070304_0025.6
Joseph Wu made his statement after China made public the Chinese draft budget bill for 2007.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20070304_0025.7
Joseph Wu stated that China is attempting to achieve global dominance because the significant budget increase, the lack of transparency in military buildup, the rapid expansion of air and naval forces, and progress in space defense technology suggests an attempt at global dominance.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20070304_0025.8
Joseph Wu stated that China's annual military spending has experienced double-digit growth since 1993.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20070304_0025.9
Joseph Wu also stated that growth in China's military expenditure is not expected to slow down in the foreseeable future but will instead accelerate and become a long-term trend.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20070304_0025.10
Joseph Wu stated that China's continued military budget growth deserves global attention and concern because there is no apparent threat and no potential future threat to China's security in sight.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20070304_0025.11
Joseph Wu stated that China's threat to Taiwan and other neighboring Asia-Pacific countries is rising.

Joseph Wu and Western military experts stated that China's actual military budget is about 3 times the officially declared figure.

The the Ministry of Economic Affairs (moea) approved lingsen precision industries, King yuan electronics, IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries for Chinese investment.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20080408_0041.5
On 8 April 2008 the Ministry of Economic Affairs (moea) announced approval for 4 Chinese investment proposals from Chinese manufacturers.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20080408_0041.6
Lingsen precision industries, King yuan electronics, IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries were approved for investment and will invest in integrated circuit packaging (ICP) and testing.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20080408_0041.7
The companies will invest 10 million US dollars, 20 million US dollars, 6.7 million US dollars, and 50 million US dollars respectively.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20080408_0041.8
The proposals have a total investment amount of 86.7 million US dollars (2.64 billion NT dollars).
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20080408_0041.9
The moea determined in a meeting on 8 April 2008 that the investment proposals met the clauses in the China Investment procedure issued by the ministry's Investment Commission.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20080408_0041.10
The Investment Commission's Executive Secretary Fan Liang-Tung stated the investment procedure aims to ensure Taiwan's investments in China will not harm Taiwan's industries and economy such as by leaking key technologies to the mainland.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20080408_0041.11
Under the procedure investment plans require approval from the moea if the plans involve a single investment that exceeds 100 million US dollars, the company's total investment in China reaches 200 million US dollars, or the investment could transfer core local industries' technologies to China.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20080408_0041.12
Fan stated core industries mainly involve the manufacturing of 8-inch wafers and 4-inch TFT panels as well as IC packaging.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20080408_0041.13
After the meeting on 8 April 2008 the Commission requires written documents to further assess the plans which contain each company's commitment on the terms of investment including the financial plan, information on any technology transfers and the company's domestic investment as well as employment information.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20080408_0041.14
Fan stated the Commission is primarily concerned with the term of future investment in Taiwan.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20080408_0041.15
Fan stated lingsen precision industries, King yuan electronics, IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries have made commitments to return capital to Taiwan in the amounts of 2 billion NT dollars, 19.2 billion NT dollars, 3 billion NT dollars and 23 billion NT dollars respectively by 2011.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20080408_0041.16
Fan stated the Commission will ensure the commitments are upheld once the investments are under way.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20080408_0041.17
Fan stated the procedure would push Chinese investment from Taiwan to focus on down scale manufacturers rather than technology-concentrated makers in a bid to keep high-end technologies in Taiwan.
PROXY_CNA_ENG_20080408_0041.18
Fan stated the Commission will hold a 2nd round of meetings to decide if the proposals will take effect and that the final decision will be made by 30 April 2008.

There are huge obstacles to achieving peace and cooperation among combatants in the former Yugoslavia.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.8
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in opening remarks at the one-day meeting that there can be no peace in the former Yugoslavia if some parties to the conflict remain heavily armed and others try to catch up.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.9
The Croation delegation threatened to pull out of arms-reduction negotiations if certain demands were not met in the nearest future.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.10
Delegates from other countries called on Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia to set aside their grievances and learn to compromise.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.11
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic complained that a part of Croatian territory is under occupation and time is running out.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.12
Granic said in reference to disputed lands on the Croatian-Serbian border that the peaceful re-integration of Eastern Slavonia is the key to the lasting stability in the region and that everyone faces the danger of another round of hostilities and the destabilization of the whole region and highly unpredictable consequences for Bosnia-Herzegovina without it.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.13
Conference participants said Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic from Serbia scolded his Croatian counterpart for grandstanding.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.14
Then Milutinovic made a threat to pull out of arms-control negotiations.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.15
Milutinovic noted the Serbian Government has been suspended since 920000 from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and said that unless full membership were restored Yugoslavia will be prevented from cooperating despite its readiness to do so.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.16
The OSCE is to oversee the next round of Balkan arms-reduction talks.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.17
Michael Williams is a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and formerly the United Nations' senior spokesman for Croatia and called the early threats from Croatia and Serbia a worrying development and an ominous development.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.18
Williams said it was really not clear that the parties are willing to engage in any arms control in a meaningful way.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.19
This corresponds to a fear expressed by some delegates to the 951218 Bonn meeting that the yugolav parties do not want to negotiate away the ability to use violence or a threat of violence to seize territory.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.20
Greek Foreign Minister karelos Papoulias observed of the Balkan belligerents that during talk in the plenary session one realizes that this is still the way they are thinking.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.21
Papoulias said the Greek government is not as optimistic as other European partners and that just because there is a Conference doesn't mean there is friendship between the people of the former Yugoslavia.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.22
The 951218 talks were organized to fulfill the combatants' pledge made in Dayton, Ohio, to begin talks to enhance mutual confidence and reduce the risk of conflict within 7 days of the Peace Accord's formal signing.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.23
The agenda on 951218 was limited to set the formal process for coming weeks.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.24
The German Foreign Ministry said in a statement that this was so as to clear the way for speedy negotiation of the substantive questions.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.25
Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia are the nations that signed the Dayton accord and are supposed to report how many tanks and armored vehicles, heavy artillery pieces, combat aircraft and attack helicopters they possess in the next phase.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.26
This data will be used to establish baselines from which weapons ceilings can be agreed on.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.27
Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia have promised to accept a set of automatic limits if agreement on such ceilings cannot be reached in 180 days.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_19951218_0100.28
Kinkel said that on 951218 delegates had been unable to fix a date for the next round of talks but said the next talks would be 960104 or 960107 in Vienna.

Indian officials seize missile assembly line from the North Korean vessel the kuwolsan on 30 June 1999.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.5
The discovery heightens suspicions of North Korean weapons proliferation.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.6
On 30 June 1999 Indian customs agents in the northwestern port city of Kandla boarded the North Korean freighter kuwolsan.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.7
Following a melee with the crew of the kuwolsan, customs agents discovered an assembly line for ballistic missiles.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.8
U.S. intelligence officials stated Libyan government was the intended recipient of the cargo.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.9
The kuwolsan departed North Korea's Nampo harbor on 10 April 1999.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.10
Records show that on 20 April 1999 the kuwolsan made detours to 2 Thai ports to pick up 14000 tons of sugar for resale along the way to the kuwolsan's destination.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.11
The kuwolsan switched course in order to sell the sugar to an Indian company after a deal to sell the sugar to Algerians failed.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.12
An Indian investigator stated that the crew of the kuwolsan should not have picked up extra cargo at several ports when carrying 200 tons of sensitive equipment and that such activity was crazy.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.13
Indian customs officials were tipped off to possible contraband on the kuwolsan while the kuwolsan was en route to Kandla.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.14
The kuwolsan was rumored to be carrying arms or ammunition possibly intended for Pakistan.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.15
Indian port officials were waiting when the kuwolsan arrived in Kandla on 25 June 1999.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.16
Irregularities in the kuwolsan's papers were apparent within the first few hours of investigation.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.17
Indian officials learned that the company in Malta listed as the intended recipient of the cargo was fictitious.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.18
Indian officials questioned why anyone in Malta would choose to buy water refining equipment from North Korea when Malta is a short flight from Europe.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.19
Indian customs agents questioned the captain of the kuwolsan Tae Min Hun.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.20
Tae blocked every request and threatened international reprisals if Indian officials did not allow Tae to leave Kandla.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.21
On 30 June 1999 customs officials demanded to search the kuwolsan's cargo boxes and Tae stated that the kuwolsan had received a telex from North Korean officials.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.22
Tae received instructions from officials in Pyongyang to allow no one to open the cargo boxes at all costs.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.23
The official Indian after-action report stated Tae would not open any more boxes as per the telex.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.24
The report stated the crew members shouted at and abused the customs officers.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.25
According to witness accounts and video footage of the encounter, tae and the crew of the kuwolsan barricaded the doors of the kuwolsan with the crews' bodies.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.26
An Indian official who was present on the kuwolsan and who spoke on the condition of anonymity stated the situation became physical and there were fisticuffs.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.27
The official stated the crew began closing the hatches to the cargo hold with the customs inspectors still inside.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.28
On 1 July 1999 armed troops and a group of government weapons experts aided customs officials and gained forcible entry onto the kuwolsan.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.29
A few crates among the kuwolsan's cargo contained equipment that could be used in a water treatment plant.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.30
Inspectors found pumps, nozzles and a few valves.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.31
The cargo boxes were labeled as water refinement equipment.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.32
Documents from the investigation contain a partial list of the contents of most of the cargo crates which included --
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.33
Components for missile subassembly.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.34
Machine Tools for setting up a fabrication facility.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.35

PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.37
Rocket nose cones, stacks of metal pipe and heavy-duty presses used for milling high-grade steel.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.38
A Plate-bending machine capable of rolling thick metal sheets, toroidal air bottles used to guide warheads after separation from a missile, and Theodolites that measure missile trajectories.

PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.40
Personal items presumably intended for North Korean workers, including cookbooks in Korean, Korean spices, pickles and acupuncture sets.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.41
An Indian government official familiar with the kuwolsan discovery stated that in the past officials had seen missiles or engine parts, but here was an entire assembly line for missiles offered for sale.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.42
The official stated that this was a complete technology transfer.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.43
A technical committee of Indian missile experts stated that the equipment was unimpeachable and irrefutable evidence of a plan to transfer not just missiles but missile-making capability.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.44
The technical panel wrote in a report that the cargo points to only one end-use, namely the assembling of missiles and manufacture of the parts and subassemblies of surface to surface missiles.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.45
Investigators searched the blueprints that were kept inside numbered plastic jackets and wrapped in brown paper.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.46
Some of the packets were labeled in English as Scud B or Scud C. Nearly all of the drawings showed rockets or sections of rockets with notes and mathematical formulas handwritten in Korean.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.47
Native Korean speakers assisted in translation but the documents contained technical code invented by North Korean scientists to replace scientific terms in Russian or Chinese.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.48
The investigation ultimately yielded information about North Korea's weapons program which Indian authorities shared with ally Governments.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.49
The Scud B and Scud C designs found on the kuwolsan were from older North Korean missile programs which were derived from Soviet missile designs of the 1950s.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.50
One Indian government official who studied the blueprints stated the science was old and dated but still functional.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.51
Retired director of the State Department's Office on strategic, proliferation and military issues in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research Greg Thielmann stated the CIA utilized the blueprints to make full mock-ups of missiles complete with decals.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.52
The blueprints included information pertaining to the inner workings of North Korea's missile industry which has been the focus of contention between the United States and North Korea since the 1980s.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.53
The cargo on the kuwolsan did not include everything needed for missile production which raises the possibility that there may have been earlier and possible later shipments.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.54
Missile expert and senior analyst at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies Timothy V. McCarthy examined some of the blueprints and other evidence and stated this was a slice in time of a technology transfer from North Korea to Libya.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.55
McCarthy stated the intelligence find helps U.S. officials learn how North Korean missile scientists learn.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.56
McCarthy stated the information gives U.S. officials an idea of how capable North Korean scientists are of progressing to more advanced missiles and gives U.S. officials insight into the aspect of proliferation when one country's officials attempt to transfer technology to another country's officials.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.57
McCarthy stated no one can stop Libyan scientists once the scientists are capable of making missiles.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.58
The kuwolsan and the crew were unaccounted for after Indian officials released the kuwolsan in 2000.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.59
Shipping experts at Lloyd's maritime division in London stated the kuwolsan's name was changed in the summer of 2000 to Sun grisan 9.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.60
As of the week of 3 August 2003 the sun grisan 9 was still in service and was last reported headed to the Somalian capital of Mogadishu.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.61
The nature of the Sun grisan 9's cargo was unknown.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.62
As of 14 August 2003 the evidence from the kuwolsan is secured in a military warehouse in New Delhi.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.63
As stated in court documents and interviews with officials in the United States and India the kuwolsan incident has reinforced a view of North Korea as the world's most dangerous source of weapons proliferation.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.64
In 1999 North Korean leader Kim Jong Il expelled U.N. inspectors, abandoned the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and declared plans to build an atomic weapon.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.65
U.S. intelligence officials stated that North Korean officials are continuing global trade in technology for weapons of mass destruction including instructions for making advanced missiles.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.66
Successive U.S. administrations have condemned North Korea's missile sales to such countries as Iran and Syria.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.67
On 31 August 1998 North Korean officials launched a 3-stage missile which heightened fears of advanced North Korean designs capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.68
The first stage splashed down in the Sea of Japan, the second stage crossed the main island of Japan and the third broke up and traveled 3450 miles downrange and fell into the Pacific Ocean.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.69
The missile test fueled work on a U.S. missile defense shield.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.70
North Korean officials have defended the right to sell weapons and have stated that North Korean officials are not bound by international treaties restricting such trade.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.71
North Korean officials have sold missiles and parts to Yemen which received 15 Scud missiles after the missiles were briefly intercepted by U.S. and Spanish naval crews off the Yemeni coast in December 1998.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.72
Libya appears to be the latest beneficiary of North Korean weapons.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.73
Other nations including Iran, Pakistan and Syria are known to have received similar help.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.74
The kuwolsan cargo attests to the existence of a gray zone composed of a combination of weak States, open borders, lack of controls and a market of buyers and sellers of weapons of mass destruction.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.75
Small packages are sometimes delivered in the luggage of individual airline passengers such as a Taiwanese businessman arrested at Zurich's airport in 2000 with North Korean missile parts in a rucksack.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.76
Larger items are moved in freighters such as the kuwolsan while technical information and designs are accessible via the Internet.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20030814_0653.77
Korea specialist with the Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California Daniel pinkston stated that intercepting weapons and equipment is difficult but not impossible but that human exchanges of plans, data, and intellectual property are difficult to intercept.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said the United States and other Governments have now been informed about the secret test through diplomatic channels.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070124_0098.9
Liu Jianchao stated that the use of anti-satellite technology does not mean China has abandoned its long-standing opposition to the military use of space.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070124_0098.10
Liu Jianchao said at a ministry briefing that the test was not targeted against any country and does not pose a threat to any country.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070124_0098.11
Liu Jianchao said that no plans for another such test by the secretive Chinese military.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070124_0098.12
The Chinese test shot destroyed an overage weather satellite 537 miles above Earth and was detected by U.S. monitors January 11, 2007.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070124_0098.13
The Chinese government refused to discuss it.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070124_0098.14
The test raised concern in the United States.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070124_0098.15
Officials and analysts interpreted it as a signal that U.S. military satellites could be vulnerable to attack by China.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070124_0098.16
China's ability to shoot down satellites could pose an added threat in the event of hostilities over Taiwan because the U.S. military relies on satellites for reconnaissance, navigation, weapons guidance systems and anti-missile defenses.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070124_0098.17
China's newly demonstrated ability could threaten Taiwanese satellites monitoring Chinese short- and medium-range missile deployments along the Taiwan Strait.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070124_0098.18
U.S. officials were dismayed by the Chinese test because the United States and Russia have abstained from such tests after testing anti-satellite technology in the 1980s.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070124_0098.19
This decision was partly because destroying satellites creates debris that could damage satellites in nearby orbits.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070124_0098.20
Liu declined to address questions on this danger.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070124_0098.21
Experts estimate that several hundred thousand debris fragments were created by the destruction of the satellite.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070124_0098.22

Arms-control experts David Albright and Jacqueline Shire of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security wrote in a criticism published the week of 19 August 2007 that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement does not specify that Iranian officials would provide the IAEA access to key people, facilities, and documents that are needed to verify Iranian answers to the IAEA's questions.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070831_0072.18
Independent experts stated Iran's latest agreement with the IAEA which gives inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information falls short of the West's demand to halt the production of concentrated uranium that could potentially be used for a bomb.

U.S. State Department spokesman for the Bush administration Tom Casey stated that while the report may offer some new details or insight into the development of Iran's program Iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070831_0072.20
Casey stated the fact that the nuclear program continues to move forward shows that the Iranian regime is continuing on a path of defiance of the international community.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070831_0072.21
Most Western Nonproliferation Experts stated the Agreement on 21 August 2007 contained little that could dissuade policymakers in Washington, London, Paris and Berlin from moving forward with another round of Security Council sanctions.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070831_0072.22
Experts stated many of the transparency issues reportedly resolved in the Agreement on 21 August 2007 should have been resolved previously.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070831_0072.23
Executive Director of nonpartisan Washington think tank the Arms Control Association Daryl G. Kimball stated the agreement does not address the problem that the Iranian government is pursuing an enrichment technology and capability that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material.

Documents outlining the Israeli proposal to allow the international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules were distributed to the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070930_0021.5
The proposal may complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for India to engage in nuclear trade.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070930_0021.6
Israeli officials convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070930_0021.7
Countries including India, Israel and Pakistan that have not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade which includes purchasing reactors, uranium fuel or yellowcake.

The Israeli presentation was made in a nonpaper that allows for official deniability.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070930_0021.10
According to a letter from the Chairman of the NSG on 17 March 2007 the Israeli presentation was offered in the context of the NSG's debate over Indian officials' bid for an exemption.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070930_0021.11
Among the nations that have not signed the Treaty only India and Israel would qualify for admission to the NSG under the Israeli proposal.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070930_0021.12
The Israeli plan offered 12 criteria for allowing nuclear trade with non-treaty states.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070930_0021.13
1 criterion indicated Israel's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and said a State should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if the State applies stringent physical protection, control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons, nuclear facilities, source material and special nuclear material in the State's territory.

PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070930_0021.28
Seigel stated --
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070930_0021.29
The Israeli government has never asked the NSG for any exemption to nuclear supply guidelines or made any Israeli-specific request of the NSG.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070930_0021.30
Israel is recognized as a full-fledged adherent to the NSG Guidelines.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20070930_0021.31
The Israeli government has urged the NSG to consider adopting a generic, multi-tiered, criteria-based approach towards nuclear technology transfers.

20080726 Iranian President Mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of mashbad that Iran had expanded its arsenal of centrifuges producing enriched uranium to over 5000.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20080727_0030.7
The statement was ahmadinejad's first asserting an expansion since the 20080400 announcement that Iran was approaching the implementation of 6000 centrifuges.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20080727_0030.8
Iran articulated the goal of 50000 centrifuges operating at the enrichment plant near the town of Natanz.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20080727_0030.9
The international community has demanded that Iran halt the production of nuclear material.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20080727_0030.10
Media reports differed on the number of centrifuges ahmadinejad cited.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20080727_0030.11
An Iranian news agency reported that ahmadinejad stated Iran had 6000 working centrifuges but the agency subsequently removed the statement from the Internet.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20080727_0030.12
Another Iranian news agency stated that ahmadinejad referred to 100000s of centrifuges.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20080727_0030.13
Experts discounted the significance of ahmadinejad's claim in the absence of information on the centrifuges' functionality.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20080727_0030.14
A Western diplomat in Tehran speaking under condition of anonymity stated that the quantity of centrifuges is less important than whether the machines are operational and efficient but that ahmadinejad's assertion will hinder a resolution of the diplomatic standoff between Iran and the West.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20080727_0030.15
Arms control expert Jeffrey G. Lewis of the new America Foundation think tank stated that the Foundation was aware of Iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but the operational status of the machines is unknown.

PROXY_LTW_ENG_20080727_0030.23
A 6-week pre-negotiation' freeze for freeze' period during which Iran would add no centrifuges and the West would refrain from promoting a 4th round of economic sanctions against Iran at the UN Security Council.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20080727_0030.24

20080726 ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that Iran might potentially halt expansion at a higher number of centrifuges that previously expected and for over 6 weeks.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20080727_0030.30
Ahmadinejad stated that the West had consented to the existing 5000-6000 centrifuges in operation provided that the number did not increase.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20080727_0030.31
5000 centrifuges can produce sufficient nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb if the material is highly enriched.
PROXY_LTW_ENG_20080727_0030.32
6000 centrifuges running continuously can produce sufficient weapons-grade uranium for 1 bomb in 6 months.

In most cases of military installations having their electricity cut off the electricity has been quickly restored.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20020406_0118.40
Often investigations show that the tug of war with the utility forces the military to spend budgeted funds for electrical power instead of diverting money for other uses.

Some of the budgeted funds cut at times have included the building country residences for generals.

US concerned over liability in the event of misidentification of a civilian plane.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.6
Brazil announced that the air force will begin shooting down aircraft used in trafficking illegal drugs in Brazilian airspace.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.7
The plan requires 8 precautionary steps before the order to shoot down a plane may be issued.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.8
Prior to the policy taking effect late 20041000 a publicity campaign will notify ranchers and others of the need to file flight plans.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.9
The Law to permit such an action was originally approved in 1998 but 1995-2003 President Fernando Henrique Cardoso never put the policy into effect.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.10
The United States dissuaded Cardoso from signing the decree out of concern that the accidental downing of civilian aircraft could expose the US government and companies to lawsuits.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.11
20010400 the United States reduced previous support for operations targeting drug-running aircraft when a Peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed an American missionary and her child.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.12
Relatives of the victims sued the US government and won a settlement due to the Government's provision of intelligence and technical support to the operation.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.13
A US State Department official stated --
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.14
US law may forbid assistance to countries that implement shoot-down laws under certain conditions.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.15
The US agrees with the Brazilian assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is both very serious and increasing.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.16
The US government has consulted the Brazilian Government about the provisions of US law.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.17
Brazilian Defense Minister Jose Viegas stated that Brazil has encountered difficulties in securing US support for the plan but recent bilateral talks led to certainty that the decree would be accepted by the US government without exposing Brazil to commercial sanctions.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.18
Brazilian officials have expressed hope that the policy will be endorsed by the US before going into effect.

The US is scheduled to provide 10.2 million dollars in drug and law enforcement aid to Brazil in 2004.

Former air force chief and current Director of the Air Institute at estacio de sa University in Rio de Janeiro General Mauro Jose Miranda gandra stated that the measure was a courageous step by the Government but the impact may be more political than practical because of self-imposed restrictions by the Brazilian government.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.21
Brazilian officials stated that the policy would be inapplicable against aircraft with children on board.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.22
Viegas stated that the limitation was necessary.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.23
Gandra stated that the provision undermines the decree's essential purpose by granting immunity to drug-smuggling aircraft carrying children and thus introducing the possibility of kidnapped children being used as human shields.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.24
Viegas stated in an interview in Brasilia that the government will use the law to more powerfully dissuade drug traffickers who have previously entered Brazilian airspace feeling unthreatened by the air force.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.25
The Government was prompted to act due to the deteriorating public security situation with increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in Sao Paolo and particularly Rio de Janeiro.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.26
Rio de Janeiro drug gangs have more firepower than the police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.27
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stated in a 2003 interview with foreign correspondents --
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.28
The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.29
Some pilots of drug-running aircraft felt so confidently immune from retribution as to make obscene gestures at pursuing Brazilian air force pilots.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.30
The constitutionality of the law has been questioned under Brazil's prohibition of the death penalty as punishment for criminal acts.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.31
Some legal experts and other commentators stated that contrary to government claims, the Statute amounts to a de facto execution of drug traffickers.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.32
The daily newspaper O Estado de Sao Paolo stated in an editorial the week of 20040718-20040824 -- the extreme measure raises ethical and juridical problems exceeding any potential benefits.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20040724_0084.33
The penalty will be applied extrajudicially by administrative decision of the Commander of the Air Force.

Some of these flights were innocent violations by ranchers in the Amazon flying between plantations.

Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez's weapons deals with Russia, curbs on military cooperation with the United States, and plans to train as many as 2 million Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible invasion by imperialist superpowers have the United States and Chavez's domestic critics worried about what the leftist former military officer is planning.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20050716_0171.6
Chavez insists that the moves are purely defensive and born of an overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect Venezuela from nations that might want to take control of Venezuela.

Venezuela is South America's largest petroleum-producing state.

PROXY_NYT_ENG_20050716_0171.11

PROXY_NYT_ENG_20050716_0171.28
The deal works out to $186.22 per rifle.

The implication was that corrupt or sympathetic members of the Venezuelan military may be aiding guerrillas.

Perhaps more distressing to Chavez's domestic opponents is the ideological training that critics say Chavez has in mind for the military and for new civilian reservists.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20050716_0171.44
Chavez called earlier in 050000 for so-called Revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist a superpower aggressor and said the first step would be to train from 100000 to 2 million volunteers in the coming years to back up active-duty armed forces.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20050716_0171.45
Military analysts estimate Venezuela's active-duty armed forces number 83,000.

PROXY_NYT_ENG_20050716_0171.59

PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081008_0040.19
Shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 September 2008 the Kenyan government claimed that the weapons on board were being shipped for Kenya's military.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081008_0040.20
The ship was en route to Kenya's main port of Mombasa.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081008_0040.21

PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081008_0040.22
Evidence has subsequently emerged that the weapons were part of a clandestine arms deal between Kenya and the separatist region of southern Sudan.

Head of the U.N. drug office Antonio Maria Costa said that Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency.

Head of the U.N. drug office Antonio Maria Costa said that Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.6
Costa said this to reporters last week as the U.N. Drug Office Office prepared to release its latest survey of Afghanistan's opium crop.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.7
The survey showed that poppy cultivation had retreated in much of Afghanistan and was overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong, most of those in the south.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.8
The survey was issued November 27, 2008.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.9
The United Nations found that the result was a 19 percent reduction in the amount of land devoted to opium in Afghanistan even though the total tonnage of opium produced dropped by just 6 percent.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.10
The study stated that the high output per acre was attributed to a good growing season in the south.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.11
The southern region is a heavily irrigated area where the Taliban maintained a strong presence in 5 provinces and have systematically encouraged opium cultivation as a way to finance their insurgency for several years.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.12
The U.N. estimates the insurgents made as much as 300 million dollars from the opium trade last year.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.13
Costa said a lot of war effort can be funded with 2 to 300 million dollars.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.14
The Taliban have producing an amount of opium that far exceeds world demand due to 3 successive years of bumper crops.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.15
Costa said the result was a glut that was depressing the price, which dropped by approximately 20 percent.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.16
Costa said that the fact that prices had not collapsed already was evidence that the Taliban, drug lords and even some farmers have stockpiled the opium.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.17
An increasing amount is also being processed in Afghanistan.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.18
Costa added that insurgents have been holding significant amounts of opium.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.19
Costa said the surplus is as much as 11000 tons, or more than twice world demand in the last 3 years and threatened to devalue their stockpiles.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.20
The United Nations found that Afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.21
World demand was estimated at about 4400 tons per year.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.22
The Taliban this year are taking a passive stance toward cultivation and putting less pressure on Afghan farmers to plant opium poppy.
PROXY_NYT_ENG_20081128_0005.23
This then supports the current price.

The Israeli newspapers that were published yesterday devoted supplements to the one year anniversary of the July war , which covered the different aspects of this war and its repercussions on Israel .
sdl_0003.38
According to Alof Ben in Haaretz , the biggest loser in this war is Ehud Olmert and the Kadima party , and the theory of unilateral Israeli withdrawals .
sdl_0003.39
On the other hand , the war has strengthened the position of the right and its leader , Benjamin Netanyahu , and it helped to bring Ehud Barak back to the government .
sdl_0003.40
But the most critical review is the one by Ben Kasbit in Maariv . He wrote : " Did we win the war that broke out exactly a year ago , or were we defeated ?
sdl_0003.41
Not exactly .
sdl_0003.42
But since Israel must win the confrontation with its enemy , the draw equals a defeat .

Is our position today better than what it was a year ago on the eve of the war ?
sdl_0003.44
Is the position of Hezbollah better today than it was a year ago ?

No , the party has been dealt quite a major military blow , but from another point of view , it achieved an important moral victory .

It is true that it was pushed back off the border fence , but it is entrenching and fortifying itself to the north of the Litani .

It was not possible to confirm the credibility of this statement from an independent source .
sdl_0003.65
The statement added , " The overall result of the raid was the annihilation of no less than 25 apostates , between the dead and injured . "
sdl_0003.66
The source added that the remainder of the armed Islamic group members managed to flee . Two people were wounded within the army ranks .
sdl_0003.67
Al - Qaeda said that the Mujahideen returned safely without any significant injuries in their ranks .

EBay Announces Today It will Acquire Ticket Website StubHub for 310 Million US Dollars

wb.c2e_0008.3
According to the international reports on January 11 , eBay announced that it will acquire online ticket website StubHub for 310 million US dollars in cash to further expand its influence on electronic commerce .
wb.c2e_0008.4
The acquisition is expected to be completed before April .
wb.c2e_0008.5
More than six years ago , Jeff Fluhr and Stanford School of Business graduate Eric Baker founded StubHub with Fluhr as its chief executive officer .
wb.c2e_0008.6
Fluhr said in a statement : " StubHub 's business model is an excellent fit with eBay , and we have admired eBay for a long time . "
wb.c2e_0008.7
Over the past two years , as investors were concerned about the slowdown in eBay 's online auction business , its poor management , slow business expansion , and other factors , its market value has been dwindling .
wb.c2e_0008.8
In succession eBay acquired Internet phone service Skype and online price - comparison company Shopping.com .
wb.c2e_0008.9
StubHub mainly operates ticket brokerage to major events .
wb.c2e_0008.10
In 2006 its ticket sales was 400 million US dollars with annual profits reaching 100 million US dollars .
wb.c2e_0008.11
Ticket sellers selling tickets on this website must pay a 15 percent fee , while buyers also have to pay a 10 percent commission to StubHub .
wb.c2e_0008.12
As of now , five million tickets have been sold on the StubHub website .

I remember my first year studying at Qinghua , I went to my first elective course called " Inspirations in the History of Physics . "
wb.c2e_0044.4
There were only ten or so of us who had chosen it that semester .
wb.c2e_0044.5
The teacher was very erudite , his lectures were very lively ; he summarized all of the recent and contemporary history of physics , and each time I was enthralled .
wb.c2e_0044.6
In all my five years at the university , I never had another course that interesting .
wb.c2e_0044.7
If I were to summarize this course , it would be : the greatest discoveries in physics all had their own necessity and theoretical basis ( for example , the development of mathematics ) .
wb.c2e_0044.8
This theory can also be applied to cooking .

One day I wanted to make green beans and bean curd sheets ( dried tofu in the Northeast ) .
wb.c2e_0044.10
Here the dried tofu sold in the stores is all compressed , very tough .

So I normally steep it in hot water , then take it out and stir - fry it .
wb.c2e_0044.12
Because that day I needed to go out in the middle of it and buy some things , I set the timer and told my wife to turn off the heat when it was done .
wb.c2e_0044.13
My wife is very lazy , and when the timer sounded , she turned off the heat and left the pot sitting on the stove .
wb.c2e_0044.14
When I came back and looked , the dried tofu was white and soft , just like freshly made .

Guo Kai 's Economic Notes : Your uncle is just your uncle .
wb.c2e_0050.2
Guo Kai 's Economic Notes
wb.c2e_0050.3
This morning I went to the supermarket with Dad , and when it came time to check out I discovered something that everybody probably knows : not everybody buys the same things .
wb.c2e_0050.4
Of course this is a no - brainer , but this is actually a major problem faced by me and many other people whenever we discuss economic issues or economic phenomena .
wb.c2e_0050.5
Most of the time , economic policy and economic theory are not aimed at individuals .
wb.c2e_0050.6
In terms of probability , if you explain the behavior of a specific individual , for example your uncle , using any economic theory , the probability that it will be accurate is virtually 0 .
wb.c2e_0050.7
In fact , in the great majority of cases the economic theory is aimed at an entire group , or a subgroup .
wb.c2e_0050.8
In terms of averages , accuracy is the goal of many economic theories ( here I 'm being inaccurate ; I hope the experts will not take it too literally , especially those with IO expertise ) .
wb.c2e_0050.9
But with regard to an ordinary person , he may never see the whole group , he sees only his co-workers , his relatives and his friends , the group of people familiar to him ; add up all the people in this group and they may number 200 , and that is already a lot of people .
wb.c2e_0050.10
Below I am going to refer to these 200 people collectively as " his uncle . "
wb.c2e_0050.11
So whenever you discuss an economic theory with someone , the response of a perfectly ordinary person would be : My uncle is n't like that , so this theory is baloney .
wb.c2e_0050.12
In other words , everybody tends to mistake the part for the whole .
wb.c2e_0050.13
Here , mistaking the part for the whole is not derogatory ; it is a limitation of the human race itself ; you have it and I have it .
wb.c2e_0050.14
If Americans had learned not to mistake the part for the whole , they might not have made such a mess of the world .
wb.c2e_0050.15
I believe that they made such a complete mess of the Middle East to a very large extent because they applied their own common sense to understanding the Middle East , which is a completely different place from the United States .
wb.c2e_0050.16
On this issue , China does not have much basis for being self - congratulatory ; China 's rapid rise has even caused some people to have a sort of misconception - that whatever China does is right - and this is in fact a manifestation of narrow - mindedness .
wb.c2e_0050.17
Therefore I believe it is extremely important to recognize that one 's own knowledge has limitations .
wb.c2e_0050.18
We need to maintain a sufficiently open attitude toward things that do n't correspond to our common sense .
wb.c2e_0050.19
So just because every time your uncle goes to the supermarket he buys hog head meat does n't mean that we should immediately assume that any theory that does not predict people going to the supermarket will buy hog head meat is wrong .
wb.c2e_0050.20
When you feel other people are talking baloney , and what other people say does not correspond to your " common sense , " you should at the same time recognize that your uncle is only your uncle , he is not the whole world .

Demagogues are calling for self - destructive taxes on oil company profits , oblivious to the reality that , in a capitalist society , profits are a critical signal that guide the flow of capital .
wb.eng_0002.10
( 1 ) If you confiscate Exxon Mobil 's profits , you reduce the capital available to the world 's largest oil company to invest in more exploratory drilling , new oil wells , new pipelines , new refineries , etc.
wb.eng_0002.11
( 2 ) If you tax oil industry profits , you also reduce the incentive for owners of outside capital to invest in new capacity .

Here in Virginia , a semblance of sanity still reigns .

Gov. Timothy M. Kaine has not yet proposed anything as breath - takingly stupid as the proposals emanating from Washington , D.C. .
wb.eng_0002.15
The Governor has said he will investigate reports of `` price gouging , '' which , given the fact that the the concept of `` price gouging '' is meaningless and impossible to define , means he will , for all practical purposes , do nothing ....
wb.eng_0002.16
Which is exactly what he should do .
wb.eng_0002.17
Nothing .
wb.eng_0002.18
Virginians and Americans will adapt to higher gas prices if government does not interfere .
wb.eng_0002.19
( The Governor also is considering applying for a waiver of federal regulations requiring cleaner gasoline be sold in Virginia 's major metro areas , but has not yet made a determination .

Unfortunately , he 's sticking to his guns on trying to raise $ 1 billion for transportation projects without raising gasoline taxes -- a topic for another post .
wb.eng_0002.22
As I have been hammering away relentlessly on this blog ( See `` A World with One Billion Cars '' ) , the world economy is moving from a 20 - year era of cheap petroleum to a plateau of more expensive petroleum .
wb.eng_0002.23
This shift is driven by the combination of ( a ) escalating world consumption of petroleum , especially in rapidly developing economies like China and India , and ( b ) the peaking of global oil production capacity , the increasing expense of exploiting the remote and isolated oil reserves that remain , and terrorist / political instability in oil - producing countries .
wb.eng_0002.24
This is not the oil companies ' fault .
wb.eng_0002.25
This is not Dick Cheney 's fault .
wb.eng_0002.26
This is not the auto industries ' fault .
wb.eng_0002.27
It is not the environmentalists ' fault .
wb.eng_0002.28
It 's the reality of geology and geopolitics .
wb.eng_0002.29
The American public can adapt to the new global realities by changing their energy - intensive lifestyles ,
wb.eng_0002.30
and politicians can help them by speaking honestly and forthrightly about why the price of gasoline is increasing , instead of demagoguing the issue for short - term political gain .
wb.eng_0002.31
Here in Virginia , the General Assembly has been examining what Virginia can do to increase energy production .
wb.eng_0002.32
That is OK , as far as it goes .
wb.eng_0002.33
But there is nothing that Virginia can do to increase the global supply of oil , and probably little it can do to increase the petroleum refining capacity needed to convert oil to gasoline .
wb.eng_0002.34
What the political and business leadership of Virginia has so far failed utterly to do is admit that Virginia is acutely vulnerable to oil price shocks .
wb.eng_0002.35
Virginians consume more gasoline per capita than the national average , in part because our transportation policy is geared toward matching every increase in automobile travel with an increase in transportation capacity with no thought of modulating travel demand .
wb.eng_0002.36
But reality is a stubborn thing .
wb.eng_0002.37
With each increase in the price of gasoline , the bankruptcy of the old order becomes increasingly evident .
wb.eng_0002.38
Let us hope that Gov. Kaine , who prides himself on straight talk , begins leveling with the people of Virginia .
wb.eng_0002.39
Jim - You are right on the money about how capitalism works ,

Why not do everything we can to assure that future arises from Virginia ?

Rather than drilling for oil and gas off the Atlantic Coast , we should be offering enormous incentives for comapnies and individuals who want to work on alternative fuel solutions to locate their business here .

wb.eng_0002.59
Andrea : How about a couple of hundred dollars ?
wb.eng_0002.60
If the GA repealed the unnecessary sales tax from last year , then the average citizen would pick up some cash .

Yup , a couple of hundred dollars is going to save the day !
wb.eng_0002.72
Jane Jacobs knew the difference between a community and a construction plan .
wb.eng_0002.73
Was n't one of her main arguments that you can not plan everything , and you should allow communities to be what they are and what they become ?
wb.eng_0002.74
Did n't she fight Robert Moses because he thought he had too much control over other peoples ' lives ?
wb.eng_0002.75
Somehow I doubt she would have gotten on board with fundamental change if it involved massive central and regional planning .
wb.eng_0002.76
Andrea , One option may be telecommuting a couple of days a week .
wb.eng_0002.77
Other than that , here 's the hard truth :
wb.eng_0002.78
There 's not much that average , hard - working families can do in the short run to cope with higher gas prices except hope that their paychecks keep pace with inflation .
wb.eng_0002.79
What you should NOT do is support demagogic political ploys that make problems worse , not better .
wb.eng_0002.80
In the longer run , you can support more pedestrian friendly , transit - friendly development patterns that give you and your family more transportation options .
wb.eng_0002.81
You should support development patterns that allow compatible uses ( houses , small office buildings , small retail shops ) to be located close to each rather than scattered all over .

but I do n't like the idea of subsidizing specific business enterprises .

wb.eng_0002.93
Others disagree .
wb.eng_0002.94
Does zone pricing constitute a finger on the scale ?
wb.eng_0002.95
If so , should the GA outlaw zone pricing ?
wb.eng_0002.96
Toomanytaxes : Zone pricing is the mechanism the oil companies use to make sure that we pay the same price as people in states with higher gas taxes .
wb.eng_0002.97
Only , we pay the extra few cents per gallon to them rather than into our state transportation accounts .

Considering the wide variety in local and state fuel taxes the near uniformity of the pump price across state lines is ... curious .
wb.eng_0002.99
I was recently on the webpage for the Energy Information Agency
wb.eng_0002.100
and their cost of fuel adjusted for inflation chart demonstates that we have been at $ 3 per gallon measured in 2005 dollars before .
wb.eng_0002.101
It is about the historic peak in real prices ,
wb.eng_0002.102
but it is hardly unprecedented , and not worth quite the hype or hysteria it is generating .
wb.eng_0002.103
It is hard to imagine a company or a family that can not improve its efficiency and reduce consumption ,
wb.eng_0002.104
and that is not a bad outcome at all .
wb.eng_0002.105
Like you , Jim , I see the bright silver lining .
wb.eng_0002.106
I seem to be getting more questions whenever I pull up in my hybrid .
wb.eng_0002.107
One data point .
wb.eng_0002.108
2:53 Why are gas prices often significantly different for the same brand between Prince William and Fairfax Counties and even at different locations within the same county ?
wb.eng_0002.109
Zone pricing is trying to do much more than reflect different tax rates .
wb.eng_0002.110
Take a look at the following link : http://www.gasbuddy.com/gb_gastemperaturemap.aspx
wb.eng_0002.111
Assuming the general accuracy of the data underlying the map ,
wb.eng_0002.112
differences in do not explain zone pricing .
wb.eng_0002.113
Look at Arizona , for example .
wb.eng_0002.114
There are much higher transportation costs in and around the Grand Canyon and much more competition in the Phoenix market .
wb.eng_0002.115
Yet , Phoenix prices tend to be signficantly higher .
wb.eng_0002.116
Ditto for taxes .
wb.eng_0002.117
From what I quickly found on the Internet , total fuel taxes for the following four states are VA ( 37.7 cents ) ; Utah ( 42.5 cents ) ; NC ( 45.6 cents ) and Montana ( 46.2 cents ) .
wb.eng_0002.118
However , both Montana and Utah have average prices that are significantly lower than either VA or NC .
wb.eng_0002.119
There 's probably less relationship to costs and zone pricing than the oil companies want the public to believe .
wb.eng_0002.120
I had a conversation with a friend the other day who owns an SUV
wb.eng_0002.121
and he is n't worried about the price of gas because he travels less than 10 miles a day ..
wb.eng_0002.122
yes ..
wb.eng_0002.123
it 'll cost more ...
wb.eng_0002.124
so he 'll have to cut back on his gourmet coffee ... two cups rather than three . :-)
wb.eng_0002.125
seriously - it 's about how far folks choose to drive and how folks define phrases like `` I must and have no choice '' .
wb.eng_0002.126
It takes a hard knock for folks to take a hard look at things they always assumed could not change .
wb.eng_0002.127
I predict ... lots of folks will be taking harder looks at whether or not choices are choices or no choice '' is truly no choice .
wb.eng_0002.128
I know it happened during the gas crisis ...
wb.eng_0002.129
and as bad as it is now - this is not as bad as then - though if $ 3 a gallon is in the rear view mirror and $ 4 a gallon on the horizon and coming fast ... we might think so ...
wb.eng_0002.130
.. but I would bet that folks would choose ( there 's that word again ) $ 4 or even $ 5 a gallon rather than waiting in line for 3 hours only to find out the guy in front of you got the last tankful .
wb.eng_0002.131
America 's love affair with the automobile is about to be revisted though I doubt seriously a divorce is anywhere near ... :-)
wb.eng_0002.132
sorry .. my attitude is grin and bear it ...
wb.eng_0002.133
it 's sort of like coffee doubling in price ...
wb.eng_0002.134
my property accessment going up 300 % ( which it did ) ...
wb.eng_0002.135
... and today .. I paid $ 68 bucks to fill up my 89 Ford Van .
wb.eng_0002.136
I got ta talk to Ray Hyde about that Hybrid .... he 's got ..
wb.eng_0002.137
he said if he had to choose .. he 'd keep his truck ... :-)
wb.eng_0002.138
Did I really say that ?
wb.eng_0002.139
That would be a tough `` choice '' .
wb.eng_0002.140
With the truck I 'd have some chance of making money ,
wb.eng_0002.141
but I 'd hate to have to drive it if it was n't working .
wb.eng_0002.142
If you have to drive , the hybrid is a joy .
wb.eng_0002.143
Dead silent , dirt cheap , reliable , little bit of capital cost detriment , sufficient power .
wb.eng_0002.144
48 mpg if you drive at 75+ like a maniac .
wb.eng_0002.145
I remember people sniffing at it , saying they would n't do it because the payback on capital was n't there .
wb.eng_0002.146
I drone on about costs and benefits , but a ) that 's not everything , and b ) sometimes circumstances change .
wb.eng_0002.147
I 'm going to have to send a letter to the guv'nor .
wb.eng_0002.148
I have a bunch of vehicles and only use the appropriate one for the task at hand .
wb.eng_0002.149
I need a portable license plate and insurance , otherwise the current `` tax '' plan is going to kill me .
wb.eng_0002.150
I sure hope that those of you who think saving open space and farms will chip in and help out on this :
wb.eng_0002.151
send a letter .
wb.eng_0002.152
I do n't mind paying what it costs to drive or paying what I owe ,
wb.eng_0002.153
but this is going to be whacked .
wb.eng_0002.154
I suspect that overhead costs might have something to do with fuel prices .
wb.eng_0002.155
That gas station in Fairfax is sitting on expensive land and paying high taxes .
wb.eng_0002.156
Businesses are `` tax positive '' do n't cha know .
wb.eng_0002.157
If people really do start making different choices , it 's going to be fun to watch real estate prices .
wb.eng_0002.158
BTW 13 % more new home sales last year , in spite of higher rates ,
wb.eng_0002.159
but prices were down 5k .
wb.eng_0002.160
Time to demand another reassessment .
wb.eng_0002.161
Ray Hyde : Taxes are indeed business overhead that affect retail prices .
wb.eng_0002.162
But I still suggest that zone pricing has more to do with computer software and data - mining than actual costs .

If you 're Arlington County , you create a new vision for the boxy buildings and subterranean passageways in Crystal City that will be emptied by the federal Base Realignment and Closure Commission .
wb.eng_0007.2
In place of the sterile monoculture that now characterizes the office complex near the Pentagon , members of an advisory task force see a more lively street - level scene with a greater mix of shops , restaurants and offices .
wb.eng_0007.3
Writes WaPo reporter Annie Gowen :
wb.eng_0007.4
[ Board of Supervisors Chairman Chris ] Zimmerman and others speaking yesterday said that the vounty sees the empty space as an opportunity to `` reimagine '' and `` brand '' Crystal City as an attractive destination .
wb.eng_0007.5
Though close to Reagan National Airport and dense with hotels , the area has long been seen as a gloomy 1960s era enclave of offices connected by underground passages .
wb.eng_0007.6
But parts of Crystal City have lately seen a rebirth , thanks to an influx of trendy cafes and a new streetscape ....
wb.eng_0007.7
Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty , which owns 7.4 million of the 11 million square feet of office space in the neighborhood , has spent $ 40 million on improvements to enliven the streets and attract new businesses .
wb.eng_0007.8
It turned Crystal Drive into a two - way main street and has recruited new shops and chic restaurants such as Jaleo and McCormick & Schmick 's .
wb.eng_0007.9
Reading between the lines of Gowen 's story , however , there seems to be one big missing piece :
wb.eng_0007.10
Housing .
wb.eng_0007.11
Creating a livelier commercial district is a worthy goal .
wb.eng_0007.12
But creating a balanced community with a mix of housing , offices , shopping and other amenities -- allowing people to live close to where they work and play -- is an even more worthy goal .
wb.eng_0007.13
As Ed Risse has pointed out , the relocation of 17,000 jobs creates a rare opportunity to create a genuine balanced communities in Northern Virginia .
wb.eng_0007.14
The problem , I surmise -- it 's not discussed in the story -- is that Arlington is concerned about protecting its tax base , which means replacing the vacated offices with new offices , not housing .
wb.eng_0007.15
It 's hard to fault Arlington for pursuing its short - term self interest .
wb.eng_0007.16
But everyone needs to recognize that Arlington 's decision not to pursue a balanced community means that housing will end up somewhere else , presumably in outlying counties .
wb.eng_0007.17
And employees working in the buffed up Crystal City will wind up commuting long distances and clogging Northern Virginia thoroughfares .
wb.eng_0009.1
So I work in that same beauty salon ,
wb.eng_0009.2
I 'm chained to the old masquerade
wb.eng_0009.3
The lipstick , the shadow , the silicone :
wb.eng_0009.4
I follow my father 's trade -
wb.eng_0009.5
Leonard Cohen
wb.eng_0009.6
Michael Jackson may be another example of a celebrity distraction which , upon examination , reveals more about our society 's mortal condition than a tabloid could imagine .
wb.eng_0009.7
Almost certainly more than it would dare to describe .
wb.eng_0009.8
Yesterday , Jackson was ordered to close Neverland for having failed to pay the ranch 's 47 employees their salary or insurance since the end of 2005 .
wb.eng_0009.9
Unfortunate for the unpaid staff and the abandoned llamas but no surprise .
wb.eng_0009.10
He 's moved on since his aquittal , like Gary Glitter did after his 1999 conviction , having departed last June for a Bahrain `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
wb.eng_0009.11
( '' For the people working at Bahrain 's malls , the person covered head to toe in a black veil , gloves and glasses appeared to be a rich , doting Saudi mother ....
wb.eng_0009.12
But why would a woman wear a man 's shoes ?
wb.eng_0009.13
Why the bodyguards ?
wb.eng_0009.14
And why did the person 's fluid movements seem so familiar ? '' )
wb.eng_0009.15
Last week 's real Jackson story ran in the New York Daily News , under the snappy banner `` Creepy dad was root of all clan 's woe , singer sez . ''
wb.eng_0009.16
The singer was brother Jermaine , and the claims based on the projected outline for his abandoned `` tell - all '' family story .
wb.eng_0009.17
Reading that Joseph was a nightmare of a father and sexually abusive towards his daughters is not exactly a `` stop the presses '' moment .
wb.eng_0009.18
What 's new is this :
wb.eng_0009.19
Jermaine even suggested his father may have set up Michael to be somehow victimized by older men .
wb.eng_0009.20
He tells how his father would have Michael join in at late - night hotel room meetings with `` important business people , '' and wondered whether `` something happened '' to Michael at those sessions .
wb.eng_0009.21
He said he sensed something was wrong because Michael would be sick for days after .
wb.eng_0009.22
`` What was Joseph doing ? '' Jermaine wrote .
wb.eng_0009.23
This lifts the Jackson family horror show to a whole new order of dysfunction , one that sees parents network with power and trade their children for privilege .
wb.eng_0009.24
This should be a motif familiar to anyone acquainted with the literature of mind control and ritual abuse survivors : the father and first controller , passing his child - victim up the social ladder of abuse in return for status , protection and reward .
wb.eng_0009.26
Or maybe not : `` LaToya also described being awakened in the night by Joseph wearing a ' monster mask . ' ''
wb.eng_0009.27
Perhaps we can take more from this than the suspicion that the Jackson clan had gotten with the program .
wb.eng_0009.28
Perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre-existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect .
wb.eng_0009.29
( This is how I tend to think of Ponchatoula 's Hosanna Church . )
wb.eng_0009.30
Yet we should n't discount the suspicion , either , particularly given some of Michael 's paranormal interests and peculiar associations .
wb.eng_0009.31
His close friendship with SPECTRA contactee and channeller of the Nine , Uri Geller , for one instance .
wb.eng_0009.32
( Jackson was Geller 's best man in 2001 when he and his wife renewed his vows , the same year Geller is said to have been reactivated as a psychic spy . )
wb.eng_0009.33
His entourage including a `` personal magician '' for another .
wb.eng_0009.34
Even if you wanted to , you wo n't be reading Jermaine 's account now .
wb.eng_0009.35
Like every Jackson sibling who 's tried to break from Joe , he 's climbed down , returned to the fold and scrapped the book , apparently on the strength of Michael 's threats to sue .
wb.eng_0009.36
Previously , Michael 's given cause for family observers to attribute his grotesque body dysmorphia to a dread of resembling his father .
wb.eng_0009.37
Yet there they were at Jackson 's trial last year , hand in hand .
wb.eng_0009.39
But his little picture may be more newsworthy than the news suggests .
wb.eng_0009.40
good stuff .
wb.eng_0009.41
having departed last June for a Bahrain `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
wb.eng_0009.42
Actually , there have been reports for the past two days of Jackson back in California .

Disinformation Distraction Dis and Dat ..

Bait and switch sets the agenda .
wb.eng_0009.48
There is no such thing as an accident .
wb.eng_0009.49
It 's Saturday morning , and the papers say a moon of Saturn is spewing life - giving water .... then I see the new R.I. post is about the perrenial child Michael Jackson .
wb.eng_0009.50
This day is named for Saturn ...
wb.eng_0009.51
" ... it was foretold that one day a mighty son of Saturn would in turn overthrow him ,
wb.eng_0009.52
and Saturn devoured all of his children when they were born to prevent this ... ''
wb.eng_0009.53
Apparently Saturn is also intimately connected with Satan , Masonics , and Revelation 13 - you know , the `` number of the beast '' ...
wb.eng_0009.54
Nevermind -
wb.eng_0009.55
I need a cup of coffee ...
wb.eng_0009.56
I looked in vain for the Cheney `` A hunting we will go '' to post this out and paste but ...
wb.eng_0009.57
And on the subject of cowardice , consider this . In a recent hunting escapade , Dick Cheney accidentally shot one of his hunting comrades .
wb.eng_0009.58
There may have been negligence involved , but that is up to the local district attorney to decide .
wb.eng_0009.59
But more importantly , I think , is the nature of the hunt .
wb.eng_0009.60
These were not wild birds .
wb.eng_0009.61
The birds were bred in captivity .
wb.eng_0009.62
They had spent their lives in pens , and then on hunting day , were released for the sole purpose of being killed by Dick Cheney and cohorts for pure sport as they flew into the open sky for their only moments of brief freedom .
wb.eng_0009.64
The link `` personal majician '' is intrigueing .
wb.eng_0009.65
From Madsen via Boucher :
wb.eng_0009.66
Jackson 's stay at the Cedars was arranged through David Kuo , George W. Bush 's White House director of the Office of Faith - based Initiatives .
wb.eng_0009.68
Kuo also previously worked for the Christian Coalition and Senator John Ashcroft .
wb.eng_0009.69
There 's also some curious Neverland / Disneyland connections to the `` Mickey Mouse Club '' children who are now stars , including Justin Timberlake ( remember the star on Janet Jackson 's breast ? ) and Brittany Spears , Christina Aguilera ...
wb.eng_0009.70
The piper walks into the mountain , still followed by the children , and the cave closes again ...
wb.eng_0009.71
Here is Boucher 's follow up to the `` majician '' link of Jeff 's .
wb.eng_0009.73
but i thought you might cover chile 's inauguration of its first woman president today instead ...
wb.eng_0009.74
maybe later as the story develops ?
wb.eng_0009.75
Jeff Boucher 's piece mentions how victims of sexual abuse often have childlike voices , almost as if their development was ' frozen ' around the time of their abuse .
wb.eng_0009.76
Jackson seems to be of this type .
wb.eng_0009.77
Or more perversely , fakes that he is :
wb.eng_0009.78
`` I was always saying [ to Jackson ] people would n't think I was so crazy if they saw who the hell you really are , that you sit around , and you drink and you curse and you 're [ expletive ] funny and you have a bad mouth , and you do n't have that high voice all the time '' -
wb.eng_0009.79
Lisa Marie Presley , in an interview quoted in a WaPo article written by Tina Brown :
wb.eng_0009.80
Michael Jackson 's False Front ?
wb.eng_0009.81
`` David Geffen , be gone !
wb.eng_0009.82
Steven Spielberg , be gone ! ''
wb.eng_0009.83
The witch doctor cursing Michael Jackson 's enemies and blessing the tarnished King of Pop himself in a voodoo ritual in Switzerland in the summer of 2000 had promised that the 25 people on Jackson 's enemies list ( would soon be dead ) ...
wb.eng_0009.84
Jackson had ordered his then business adviser , Myung - Ho Lee , a U.S. - educated Korean lawyer based in Seoul , to wire $ 150,000 to a bank in Mali for a voodoo chief named Baba , who then had 42 cows ritually sacrificed for the ceremony .
wb.eng_0009.85
Jackson had already undergone a blood bath ...
wb.eng_0009.86
The pop star , who is said to be $ 240 million in debt , had paid six figures for a ritual cleansing using sheep blood to another voodoo doctor and a mysterious Egyptian woman named Samia , who came to him with a letter of greeting from a high - ranking Saudi prince , purportedly Nawaf Bin Abdulaziz Al - Saud , now the chief of intelligence of Saudi Arabia ...
wb.eng_0009.87
http://www.vanityfair.com/commentary/content/articles/050411roco03c hmm .
wb.eng_0009.88
According to that Vanity Fair article , Jacko and Uri Geller met through `` that other fellow devotee of children 's charities Mohamed Fayed , the chairman of Harrods in London , who believes that the C.I.A. and Prince Philip had Princess Diana and his son , Dodi , killed . ''
wb.eng_0009.89
Anonymous quoted , `` Jackson 's stay at the Cedars was arranged through David Kuo ... ''
wb.eng_0009.90
Hold on --
wb.eng_0009.91
the Cedars is the headquarters of the Fellowship Foundation , the creepy Christianoid cult with deep political connections .
wb.eng_0009.92
Here 's a bit of the original Madsen article that the Michael Jackson quote comes from :
wb.eng_0009.93
In 1976 , the Fellowship began looking for a permanent headquarters in Arlington .
wb.eng_0009.94
It set its sights on the estate of George Mason IV , The Cedars , located at 2301 North Uhle Street .
wb.eng_0009.95
Mason was one of the drafters of the Bill of Rights .
wb.eng_0009.96
The Fellowship , also known as the International Foundation , bought the property from Charles Piluso .
wb.eng_0009.97
Although not much is known about Piluso , the Los Angeles Times reported that Howard Hughes , the man with whom Fellowship Senator Ralph Owen Brewster once sparred , also lived there .
wb.eng_0009.98
According to a senior Pentagon official , the Cedars had been used as a CIA safe house prior to the Fellowship 's purchase of the estate .
wb.eng_0009.99
The Fellowship paid $ 1.5 million for the Cedars , the money coming from Tom Phillips , the CEO of Raytheon , and Ken Olsen , the CEO of Digital Equipment Corporation .
wb.eng_0009.100
Sanford McDonnell of McDonnell Douglas Corporation was another deep - pocketed supporter of the Fellowship through Full Gospel Business Men 's Fellowship International , an activity linked to Fellowship core member Pat Robertson .
wb.eng_0009.101
Suffer the little children , eh ?
wb.eng_0009.102
If this is what power & wealth does to you , I 'm damn glad I have neither .
wb.eng_0009.103
You said , `` Perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre-existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect . ''
wb.eng_0009.104
Could n't agree more .
wb.eng_0009.105
I think that pedophilia 's relative commonality is what really makes it frightening .
wb.eng_0009.106
My experience happened when I was 15 .
wb.eng_0009.107
A friend of mine met this guy who was twice our age & who was more than willing to buy us all the whiskey we could drink .
wb.eng_0009.108
We were both enamored with Kerouac & Jim Morrison & meeting strange characters & this guy definitely fit the bill .
wb.eng_0009.109
He was muscle for a Pittsburgh madam named Tex Gill .
wb.eng_0009.110
She dressed like a man & ran most of the massage parlors in Pgh .
wb.eng_0009.111
He was into black magick & Crowley & booze & drugs & on & on .
wb.eng_0009.113
& my buddy passes out .
wb.eng_0009.114
I continue drinking .
wb.eng_0009.115
At one point , I glance at this older guy ,
wb.eng_0009.116
& he is staring at my buddy as a line of drool runs down the cigarette in his mouth & drips on to the floor .
wb.eng_0009.120
He notices that I 'm kind of staring at him .
wb.eng_0009.121
He stands up , walks into the bedroom , & comes back with a porno mag .
wb.eng_0009.122
He drops it on the couch next to me .
wb.eng_0009.123
As he 's sitting down , he says , `` See anything you like ? ''
wb.eng_0009.124
& then he shoves his hand hard into my groin .....
wb.eng_0009.125
.... & I broke his nose with my elbow .
wb.eng_0009.143
I apologize for continuing my ramble but ... ,

MICHAEL JACKSON
wb.eng_0013.2
MANCHILD IN A PROMISED LAND
wb.eng_0013.3
by ROBERT J. LEWIS
wb.eng_0013.4
He 's such an easy target , Michael Jackson .
wb.eng_0013.5
He makes even the weirdest of the weird feel normal .
wb.eng_0013.6
But unlike them , Jackson does n't try to hide the fact that he is easily one of the most screwed up beings on the planet .
wb.eng_0013.7
Every time he checks in for yet another surgery , he is announcing to the world that he does n't know who he is , where he is going , and that he thoroughly loathes himself - at least the adult version .
wb.eng_0013.8
And for his remarkable honesty , his most unprivate confessions , he is subjected to one public humiliation after another .
wb.eng_0013.9
Who among us rock throwers would have the courage to reveal about ourselves what Michael has revealed about himself ?
wb.eng_0013.10
Next to the towering monument that the unedited Michael Jackson is we are telephone booths ;
wb.eng_0013.11
next to his singular guilelessness and candor , we are the multitude of the prevaricating and pusillanimous .
wb.eng_0013.12
Everything Michael has done and said during the past 20 years has been against his own apparent self - interest , beginning with unrelenting surgical assaults on his erstwhile good looks , to hanging his child ( and crotch for that matter ) out to dry , to entering details of his bedroom antics into the public domain .
wb.eng_0013.13
Like a typical Dostoievksy character , we can not account for the behavior if it were n't for an apparently overriding need to confess and proclaim -- over and against what the outside world wants to believe -- the truth of who we are .
wb.eng_0013.14
The on - going spectacle of Michael 's increasingly bizarre conduct is his confession to the world that he is one spectacularly psychologically - challenged dude .
wb.eng_0013.15
Like children who are incapable of dissimulating their basic wants and needs , Michael 's manner of being in the world is uncensored and spontaneous ,
wb.eng_0013.16
and to such an unsuspected extent I propose he deserves to be considered one of the most authentic beings of this or any other century , and quite properly belongs to that exceptional society of authenticity - questers that would include Saint Augustine , Pascal and Heidegger .
wb.eng_0013.17
The facts of Michael 's life have been well documented .
wb.eng_0013.18
We know that by the age of 25 he was on top of the world .
wb.eng_0013.19
Thriller had sold an unprecedented 50 million copies and Billie Jean had become the musical drug of choice in every corner of the world .
wb.eng_0013.20
Not only was the song 's momentum and tension brilliantly crafted and fused , Michael 's riveting , counterpoint choreography - which remains unsurpassed -- revolutionized the way we simultaneously look at and listen to music .
wb.eng_0013.21
Before disbelieving eyes , his torso , head and limbs supplied never - before - seen anatomical rejoinders to the notes -- like a guitarist filling in between the lyrics .
wb.eng_0013.22
But from here on in , it would be downhill for the genre 's quintessential messenger , for Michael could no longer sustain the ' great lie ' he was living .
wb.eng_0013.23
The child 's ' tin drum ' was beating ever louder in his head
wb.eng_0013.24
and he intuitively understood that he was developmentally under - equipped to handle the adult pressures of stardom .
wb.eng_0013.25
Far more compelling than the promise of even greater fame and fortune was the example of Oskar , from Gunther Grass ' The Tin Drum ( 1959 ) , which tells the story of a boy who refuses to grow up , who , through his drumming , rejects the adult world and the horrors taking place in Nazi Germany .
wb.eng_0013.26
Like Oskar , Michael had witnessed firsthand the abominations of adult behaviour and refused to sign up .

From his earliest years , Michael Jackson was subjected to both extreme psychological and physical abuse at the hands of his status - obsessed father , who designated Michael as the vessel into which he would mercilessly pour the acid of his unrealized ambitions .
wb.eng_0013.28
To this single end , Joe Jackson was ruthlessly single - minded .
wb.eng_0013.29
Michael was terrified of him , whose mere presence could induce nausea .
wb.eng_0013.30
At the age of 5 , the father yanked the son from his pail and sandbox existence and made him run Hollywood 's grimmest gauntlets .
wb.eng_0013.31
The little mouse that Michael was suddenly found himself in the rat race and quickly learned to hate it ,
wb.eng_0013.32
and like Oskar , who found respite in the beating of his tin drum , Michael found solace on stage , performing his music .
wb.eng_0013.33
But the stage could not provide Michael with immunity against the constant encroachment of the adult world .
wb.eng_0013.34
Listen to his rapid breathing in especially Off the Wall and Thriller : the staccato - like panting of a stalked animal , the desperate breath of human panic , and his small boy 's voice hiding behind the mesmerizing slash and blur of arms and legs fending off an invisible attack .
wb.eng_0013.35
From one track to the next , the lyrics are n't so much sung as frantically whispered , the vowels cut short to the quick .
wb.eng_0013.36
Michael was announcing that he could no longer follow the course Father and Hollywood had staked out for him , that the disparity between his real self and the role he was thrust into had reached unsustainable incommensurability .
wb.eng_0013.37
Only the child within could save the defenceless adult from the depredations of the adult world ,
wb.eng_0013.38
and from this point on , Michael would reduce the project of his life to letting the world know the truth of who he was : a confused , fragile , lost soul in search of care and love .
wb.eng_0013.39
By the time Michael had attained mythic status , he was so far removed and alienated from himself , he would have to shed , over a period of 20 years and still counting , one skin after another before his true self could begin to emerge .
wb.eng_0013.40
As we might expect from someone so radically self - estranged , the result has been nothing less than a metamorphosis .
wb.eng_0013.41
Michael 's journey of self - discovery is a work in progress like no other because it increasingly depends on the accommodation of two irreconcilables : the child and adult as one .
wb.eng_0013.42
More revealing of itself than its favorite target , public opinion has not seen fit to grant Michael the inalienable right to his confused mental state and ' off the wall ' comportment .
wb.eng_0013.43
If most people subscribe to the notion that black and white are not only skin colors but states of mind , why are we baffled or offended when Michael , who was introduced to the white ways of Hollywood at the age of 5 , tells us that he is n't sure what his true color is ?
wb.eng_0013.44
Robbed of his childhood , abused by a psychotic father and then prematurely subjected to the adult pressures of the entertainment world , why are we surprised to learn that Michael does n't want to grow up , that he prefers the company and community of children , that he wants to be protected and looked after ?
wb.eng_0013.45
Every time the androgynous Jackson goes under the knife he is crying out that he does n't know if he is man or woman , child or adult , black or white .
wb.eng_0013.46
As if we would have done otherwise in his situation ?
wb.eng_0013.47
And to the never - ending suspicion that Michael is a child abuser , what crime has been committed when two experimenting 11 - year - olds fool around sexually ?
wb.eng_0013.48
If you believe that Michael has the mentality of an 11 - year - old , ( and there has n't been much evidence to the contrary during the past 20 years ) he should not have had to defend himself against accusations of child molestation .
wb.eng_0013.49
Was it in defense of perversity or his incorrigible innocence that convinced him that it was OK to reveal that he shared his bed with children ?
wb.eng_0013.50
More questionable , even criminal , than Michael 's alleged fooling around with other kids , were the parents who allowed , even encouraged their children to sleep over and perhaps share the same bed with someone whose sexual predilections have been suspect since 1991 .
wb.eng_0013.51
On June 13 , 2005 , the courts found Michael not guilty of the charges brought against him .
wb.eng_0013.52
However , those whose minds were decided on his guilt before the trial began will not be changed by the verdict , just as Michael 's essential nature will not have changed .
wb.eng_0013.53
Mahatma Gandhi writes that ' There is a higher court than courts of justice and that is the court of conscience . '
wb.eng_0013.54
Only Michael knows if he is sexually attracted to children , and beyond that , if he has ever acted on those feelings .
wb.eng_0013.55
And if we grant him the mental age of an 11 - year - old , who has nonetheless conventionally fathered two children , Michael is then a child trapped in an adult body .
wb.eng_0013.56
Which means the crowning act in his quest for authenticity awaits one final operation .
wb.eng_0013.57
What does a man do when he feels , acts and responds like a woman trapped in a man 's body ?
wb.eng_0013.58
He undergoes sexual reassignment surgery and hormone therapy in order to become who ' she ' is .
wb.eng_0013.59
There remains one final procedure that will totally liberate the child that Michael is .
wb.eng_0013.60
When Michael finds the courage to act on what his duty toward other children demands -- submit to voluntary neutering -- which will be tantamount to his final confession , the saving grace and glory that is his Neverland will become his forever land .
wb.eng_0013.61
Tennessee Williams has said for all time , `` there 's not enough kindness in the world . ''
wb.eng_0013.62
And I say this to you , Michael Jackson , may your tribe increase .

`` Thank God I 'm an atheist : ''
wb.eng_0014.2
The surrealistic cinema of Luis Bunuel --
wb.eng_0014.3
by Bryan M. Papciak
wb.eng_0014.4
`` The thought of death has been familiar to me for a long time , '' says Director Luis Bunuel .
wb.eng_0014.5
`` From the time that skeletons were carried through the streets of Calanda during the Holy Week procession , death has been an integral part of my life .
wb.eng_0014.6
I 've never wished to forget or deny it ,
wb.eng_0014.7
but there 's not much to say about it when you 're an atheist '' ( 255 ) .
wb.eng_0014.8
So reads an accurate testimonial to the personal and artistic sentiment of this odd and serious filmmaker .
wb.eng_0014.9
Like many of his contemporary surrealists , Bunuel is a paradox who on one hand claims apathy towards ultimate end , being , and Being , yet on the other hand loads his impressive body of work with moribund imagery and strange ideas about the God he so vociferously denies .
wb.eng_0014.10
Bunuel exhibits a radical , iconoclastic view of the world in which he finds society decadent and antithetical to human liberation .
wb.eng_0014.11
He has been called a realist , a surrealist , a Marxist , an anarchist , a mystic , an anticleric , a Freudian , a post-Freudian , a sadist , a moralist , a Christian , and a poet - showman of the macabre .
wb.eng_0014.12
His scenarios range from the absurd to the tragic to the satiric to the erotic , profusely endued with the outrageous and the scandalous .
wb.eng_0014.13
Luis Bunuel has long been recognized in European critical circles as a great and prolific filmmaker on a par with Eisenstein , Chaplin , and Fellini .
wb.eng_0014.14
However , only recently has his reputation in America begun to catch up .
wb.eng_0014.15
Over his fifty - year career he directed thirty - two feature films and worked in Spain , France , Mexico , Italy , and the United States .
wb.eng_0014.16
Utilizing sardonic humor and the imagery of surrealism , Bunuel set out to undermine the values and institutions people take for granted .
wb.eng_0014.17
His aims were specific : through the surreal , visualizing the impulses of the uncon - scious , he would , he said , `` shatter the optimism of the bourgeoisie world and force the reader ( or spectator ) to question the permanency of the prevailing order '' ( Mellen 3 ) .
wb.eng_0014.18
Luis Bunuel was born February 22 , 1900 in Calanda , a small town in the province of Teruel , Spain .
wb.eng_0014.19
As a youth he received a Jesuit education , displaying exceptional talent in music , athletics , and the natural sciences .
wb.eng_0014.20
He enjoyed a comfortable upbringing in a reasonably wealthy , close - knit family .
wb.eng_0014.21
His family came from liberal , semi-intellectual , land - owning bourgeoisie .
wb.eng_0014.22
These details are not irrelevant .
wb.eng_0014.23
To comprehend Bunuel 's works it is essential to understand that he was first a Spaniard and secondly a product of Spanish bourgeoisie .
wb.eng_0014.24
Virginia Higgenbotham points out that `` blasphemy is only a form of thinking for any intelligent Spaniard , '' and also that the `` art of his country is rich in eroticism and profoundly preoccupied with death '' ( 18 , 20 ) .
wb.eng_0014.25
Bunuel says : My infancy slipped by in an almost medieval atmosphere ( like that of nearly all the Spanish provinces ) between my native town and Zaragova .
wb.eng_0014.26
I feel it necessary to say here ( since it explains in part the trend of the modest work which I later accomplished ) that the two basic sentiments of my childhood which stayed with me well into adolescence , are those of a profound eroticism , at first sublimated in a great religious faith , and a permanent consciousness of death .
wb.eng_0014.27
It would take too long here to analyze the reasons .
wb.eng_0014.28
It suffices that I was not an exception among my compatriots , since this is a very Spanish characteristic , and our art , exponent of the Spanish spirit , was impregnated with these two sentiments .
wb.eng_0014.29
The last civil war , peculiar and ferocious as no other exposed them clearly .
wb.eng_0014.30
Coming of age , Bunuel expressed a strong urge to go to Paris to study music but was sent instead to Madrid to study agricultural engineering .
wb.eng_0014.31
After a few years , he switched his studies to entomology , and , more importantly , began forming close friendships with a group of young artists who were to influence him strongly in the future .
wb.eng_0014.32
These companions included the poets Frederico Garcia Lorca and Jose Moreno Villa and the painter Salvador Dali .
wb.eng_0014.33
In the Madrid residencia Bunuel developed his interest in the arts , theater , and acting and gained his introduction to surrealism .
wb.eng_0014.34
After graduating in 1925 with a degree in Philosophy and Letters , Bunuel moved to Paris , joined by a few members of his residencia coterie .
wb.eng_0014.35
Bunuel arrived in Paris highly recommended by influential friends of his parents and was introduced into the best intellectual circles of the city .
wb.eng_0014.36
He was soon hired as an Assistant Director to Jean Epstien , `` the only director of that bleak era of the French cinema to merit the title of an intellectual filmmaker '' ( Aranda 32 ) .
wb.eng_0014.37
While honing his skills working as an A.D. , Bunuel also began contributing articles to various literary cinema periodicals , most notably La Gaceta Hispanoamericana .
wb.eng_0014.38
In 1929 he formally entered the Paris Surrealist Group .
wb.eng_0014.39
Within this setting he embarked on his first film project as director , a collaboration with his residencia friend Salvador Dali , entitled Un Chien Andalou .
wb.eng_0014.40
He collaborated with Dali again in 1930 on another surrealist film , L_Age d' Or .
wb.eng_0014.41
The rest , as they say , is history .
wb.eng_0014.42
Some critics , most notably Pauline Kael and Penelope Gilliatt , now regard Bunuel as the Hitchcock of surrealism -- a venerated master in total command of his medium and for whom the art of filmic manipulation became a `` delightful form of play . ''
wb.eng_0014.43
For Bunuel , however , play had little to do with it .
wb.eng_0014.44
Rather , he saw surrealism as a revolutionary , poetic , and moral movement :
wb.eng_0014.45
All of us were supporters of a certain concept of revolution , and although the surrealists did n't consider themselves terrorists , they were constantly fighting a society they despised .
wb.eng_0014.46
The principle weapon was not guns , of course , it was scandal .
wb.eng_0014.47
Scandal was a potent agent of revelation , capable of exposing such social crimes as exploitation of one man by another , colonialist imperialism , religious tyranny -- in sum , all the secret and odious underpinnings of a system that had to be destroyed .
wb.eng_0014.48
He went on to say , `` The purpose of surrealism was not to create a new literary , artistic , or even philosophical movement , but to explode the social order , to transform life itself ' ( 107 ) .
wb.eng_0014.49
Salvador Dali recalled the surrealists ' ideology , `` It is possible to systematize confusion thanks to a paranoia and active process of thought and so assist in discrediting completely the world of reality '' ( Gould 37 ) .
wb.eng_0014.50
Indeed , the intent of surreal art is to move one from the conscious mind into the subconscious .
wb.eng_0014.51
It seeks to affect the emotions through the mind .
wb.eng_0014.52
Michael Gould states in Surrealism and the Cinema , `` If the vision revealed is too much for the rational mind to absorb ( too intense , too threatening , too ' real ' ) yet can not be rejected , then it leaves the consciousness and comes to exist on a sublime level as pure surrealism '' ( 13 ) .
wb.eng_0014.53
In Un Chien Andalou , for example , a girl 's eye is sliced with a razor blade ,
wb.eng_0014.54
a man wipes his mouth completely off his face ,
wb.eng_0014.55
dead donkey carcasses adorn a piano ,
wb.eng_0014.56
a man 's hand crawls with ants .
wb.eng_0014.57
Each of these images is clearly too intense for rational thought .
wb.eng_0014.58
Bunuel was drawn to the surrealist movement for more than revolutionary or psychological reasons .
wb.eng_0014.59
The moral aspects of the movement intrigued him as well :
wb.eng_0014.60
For the first time in my life , I 'd come into contact with a coherent moral system that , as far as I could tell , had no flaws .
wb.eng_0014.61
It was an aggressive morality based on the complete rejection of all existing values .
wb.eng_0014.62
We had other criteria :
wb.eng_0014.63
we exalted passion , mystification , black humor , the insult , and the call of the abyss .
wb.eng_0014.64
Inside this new territory , all our thoughts and actions seemed justifiable ;
wb.eng_0014.65
there was simply no room for doubt .
wb.eng_0014.66
Everything made sense .
wb.eng_0014.67
Our morality may have been more demanding and more dangerous than the prevailing order , but it was also stronger , richer , more coherent .
wb.eng_0014.68
The surreal qualities in Bunuel 's films can be traced to a number of sources ,
wb.eng_0014.69
but the primary impetus was his `` irrational sensibility '' as evidenced by his treatment of image , montage , and sound .
wb.eng_0014.70
These gave his films their dreamlike quality .
wb.eng_0014.71
His most intense images are evocative of either humor or mystery .
wb.eng_0014.72
Mystery , he believed , is the essential element of any art ;
wb.eng_0014.73
it is inseparable from chance ,
wb.eng_0014.74
and the whole universe is a mystery ,
wb.eng_0014.75
Bunuel believed that his own form of atheism led inevitably to the acceptance of the inexplicable .
wb.eng_0014.76
`` Since I reject the idea of a divine watchmaker , '' he said , `` ( a notion even more mysterious than the mystery it supposedly explains ) , then I must consent to live in a kind of shadowy confusion ....
wb.eng_0014.77
At least it keeps my moral freedom intact '' ( 174 ) .
wb.eng_0014.78
Predictably , adherence to fantasy as opposed to reason in a rationalistic society leads to conflict .
wb.eng_0014.79
The surrealists opposed nearly all traditional values and , as noted before , sought to destroy `` all conventional social , moral , and artistic habits of thought and perception '' ( Higgenbotham 30 ) .
wb.eng_0014.80
Enter Un Chien Andalou .
wb.eng_0014.81
In 1929 , Un Chien Andalou was as shocking and scandalous as Bunuel and Dali had hoped it would be .
wb.eng_0014.82
It gave rise to a staggering range of interpretations : poetic , scandalous , incoherent , an attack upon critics , an attack upon religion , and attack upon the bourgeoisie .
wb.eng_0014.83
( Interestingly , the film was financed by Bunuel 's bourgeois mother . )
wb.eng_0014.84
Un Chien Andalou ( which means An Andalusian Dog -- though there are no dogs in the film ) was deliberately intended to jolt the spectator 's peace of mind and to convey some of the basic beliefs underlying the surrealist movement , including the omnipotence of desire .
wb.eng_0014.85
Bunuel stated that he and Dali held to only one rule during the production ,
wb.eng_0014.86
`` No idea or image that might lend itself to rational explanation of any kind would be accepted .
wb.eng_0014.87
We had to open all doors to the irrational and keep only those images that surprised us without trying to explain why '' ( 104 ) .
wb.eng_0014.88
The aim of the film was not exclusively to shock , but to incendiarially affect the collective conscience .
wb.eng_0014.89
At the same time it was an indictment of all the art consumers who , either through stupidity , masochism , or self interest , were willing to swallow anything , no matter how much it went against their instincts .
wb.eng_0014.90
Bunuel asked , `` What can I do about the people who adore all that is new , even when it goes against their deepest convictions , or about the insincere , corrupt press and the inane herd that saw beauty and poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate call for murder ? '' ( Bauche 9 ) .
wb.eng_0014.91
The film is a dream and , like a dream , is both fascinating and disturbing .
wb.eng_0014.92
The opening scene in which a girl 's eye is sliced sets the tone of the film 's meandering and confusing itinerary .
wb.eng_0014.93
Many of the elements that make up the film are remnants of objective reality .
wb.eng_0014.94
The way they are arranged within the scenario pushes them into a mental reconstruction process -- in exactly the way dreams draw on the previous day 's experience .
wb.eng_0014.95
Interestingly , the images have the matter - of - fact quality of a newsreel , or what Higgenbotham calls a `` prosaic realism '' ( 38 ) .
wb.eng_0014.96
Bunuel chose not to use the distorted lenses , supered images , or blurred focus ( cinematic conventions of the day ) to suggest the dreamlike quality of his film .
wb.eng_0014.97
Instead , he approached the entire non-narrative in a straightforward manner .
wb.eng_0014.98
He used the shocking incongruity of the images themselves to build the hallucinatory feeling of anguish that runs through the film .
wb.eng_0014.99
The unrealistic fashion in which the realistic images were juxtaposed was the perfect way , according to Freddy Bauche , to illustrate `` the dramatic collision between desire and the object of desire '' ( 10 ) .
wb.eng_0014.100
Obviously , the director drew much of Un Chien Andalou from his Spanish heritage -- the religious and social implications , the themes of emotionalism and death , even the donkey carcasses .
wb.eng_0014.101
`` Thus Un Chien Andalou , as a milestone in the history of cinema , emerges from its director 's adolescence in Spain and announces the themes and techniques that were to preoccupy Bunuel for half a century , through the rest of his career '' ( Higgenbotham 39 ) .
wb.eng_0014.102
Where desire and eroticism prevailed in Un Chien Andalou , religion took center stage in Simon del Desierto ( Simon of the Desert ) , produced in Mexico in 1965 .
wb.eng_0014.103
Simon del Desierto is a bizarre little narrative set in the fifth century A.D.
wb.eng_0014.104
Saint Simon , in order to be as close to God as possible , has stood praying on top of a sixty - foot pillar for thirty - seven years .
wb.eng_0014.105
He is profoundly sanctimonious - to the degree that he even blesses his own tooth when it falls from his mouth .
wb.eng_0014.106
His devotion , however , is put to the test when the Devil ( a woman wearing the uniform of a Catholic school girl ) arrives in a slithering coffin at the pillar .
wb.eng_0014.107
She is intent on luring the Holy Disciple from his perch as she repeatedly ridicules him and insults his character .
wb.eng_0014.108
Simon heroically resists her temptations at every turn despite her various disguises ; first , a priest , then a shepherd , and finally as the Savior himself .
wb.eng_0014.109
At last , despite Simon 's holy strength , and for reasons not entirely clear , the Devil is able to exert her full power and whisk him away to hell -- a Greenwich village disco where trendies writhe and grind to `` The Radioactive Flesh . ''
wb.eng_0014.110
The implications are staggering .
wb.eng_0014.111
`` The saint , devoted to his god , sits high on a pillar for all of life ....
wb.eng_0014.112
But the pillar , discolored over the years , winding and twisting its way to the ground , is the excrement of the saint .
wb.eng_0014.113
Saint though he is , his bowels must still move .
wb.eng_0014.114
So there he sits , near God indeed , but supported on a pillar of excrement '' ( Mellen 115 ) .
wb.eng_0014.115
There have been several interpretations of this seemingly blasphemous imagery .
wb.eng_0014.116
One is that God and his church are really built on unacknowledged humanity .
wb.eng_0014.117
Another is that we can reach God only through understanding the true nature of our humanity .
wb.eng_0014.118
Still another is that religion ( primarily Catholicism ) is essentially a `` pillar of excrement . ''
wb.eng_0014.119
Bunuel himself put all the interpretations in perspective when he said , `` Thank God I 'm still an atheist . ''
wb.eng_0014.120
Luis Bunuel 's flair for perverse surrealism and his malicious attacks on conventional morality were fully realized in his second to last film , Le Fantome de la Liberte ( The Phantom of Liberty ) , produced in France in 1974 -- almost fifty years after Un Chien Andalou .
wb.eng_0014.121
Fantome in many ways functioned as a sort of sequel to his 1972 film , Le Channe Discret de la Bourgeoisie ( The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie ) .
wb.eng_0014.122
The images are astounding and playfully absurd :
wb.eng_0014.123
Spanish hostages of the Napoleonic war cry `` Down with Freedom ! '' as they are executed .
wb.eng_0014.124
A French lieutenant fondles the statue of a beautiful noblewoman and is struck on the head by another statue .
wb.eng_0014.125
Bourgeois couples discuss defecation around a toilet - lined table but consider `` food '' an impolite topic , and so on .
wb.eng_0014.126
The titular reference to a `` phantom '' boffows from the opening line of Karl Marx 's Communist Manifesto :
wb.eng_0014.127
`` A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of communism . ''
wb.eng_0014.128
Bunuel twists this meaning to imply that the specter haunting the bourgeoisie is `` the possibility of its own freedom unburdened by the dead ends of sexual license , willful irrationality , and the liberty to go beyond the self - indulgent eccentricities of the individual ego '' ( Mellen 318 ) .
wb.eng_0014.129
Bunuel compared the film to one of his earlier surrealist works , L_Age d' Or , saying , `` It is no longer possible to scandal-ize people as we did in 1930 .
wb.eng_0014.130
Today you have to do it with sweet subversion '' ( Mellen 183 ) .
wb.eng_0014.131
Le Fantome de la Liberte charges that society has substituted arbitrary willfulness for freedom .
wb.eng_0014.132
One of the film 's vignettes shows two parents who insist on declaring their daughter a missing person , although she is plainly sitting in front of them .
wb.eng_0014.133
The police , in a similar display of willful blindness to reality , even ask the child herself for her vital statistics and how she disappeared .
wb.eng_0014.134
In another episode , four chain - smoking monks gamble with their holy medallions in a card game .
wb.eng_0014.135
`` I 'll open with a virgin , '' says one .
wb.eng_0014.136
Another plays a `` father . ''
wb.eng_0014.137
Bunuel believed reality is actually a smoke screen for hidden urges .
wb.eng_0014.138
He used the absurd to imply `` an attack on specific abuses , not on some safely vague condition of man '' ( Durgnat 65 ) .
wb.eng_0014.139
In Le Fantome de la Liberte Bunuel doubts not so much the possibility for society 's redemption as its likelihood .
wb.eng_0014.140
`` We have been rendered unwittingly comfortable within our psychic cages to the point where we prefer them to liberty , an experience and aspiration we neither understand or desire '' ( Mellen 331 ) .
wb.eng_0014.141
For fifty years , Luis Bunuel made films about society 's dilemmas .
wb.eng_0014.142
His art is his declaration of confidence in a human race dominated by a bourgeoisie given to hypocrisy , sadism , and above all , a disrespect for its own capacity to live differently and better .
wb.eng_0014.143
He summed it all up himself :
wb.eng_0014.144
As I drift toward my last sigh , I often imagine a final joke .
wb.eng_0014.145
I convoke around my deathbed my friends who are confirmed atheists as I am .
wb.eng_0014.146
Then a priest , whom I have summoned , arrives ;
wb.eng_0014.147
and to the horror of my friends , I make my confession , ask for absolution for my sins , and receive extreme unction .
wb.eng_0014.148
After which I turn over on my side and expire .
wb.eng_0014.149
But will I have the strength to joke at that moment ?
wb.eng_0014.150
Luis Bunuel died in 1983 .

Abather joined U.S. `` democratization '' efforts , such as a project to create a governing council for his neighborhood , and he occasionally ended up in the good - news Iraq stories that still seemed plausible in those days ;
wb.eng_0015.18
one U.S. paper ran a five - column photo of him perched on a classroom chair surrounded by American soldiers , with a story about the `` new Iraq . ''
wb.eng_0015.19
These days , Abather and his young family are among the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who have fled in fear for their lives .
wb.eng_0015.20
After months spent dodging insurgents who had targeted them for supporting the Americans , he and Balqes are relieved to have escaped -- and bitter , like thousands of fellow refugees , that the superpower for which they risked their lives has abandoned them .
wb.eng_0015.21
A short man who bundles his shattered body in layers against the desert 's winter chill , the 34 - year - old Abather is polite and relaxed , with an easy smile .
wb.eng_0015.22
An engaging conversationalist even in broken English , he loves to talk about Baghdad , his infant daughter , and his wife , an outspoken woman several years his senior , whom he calls a genius .
wb.eng_0015.23
`` When we met she was a professor at Baghdad University , '' he boasts .
wb.eng_0015.24
`` I was her student .
wb.eng_0015.25
When she walked into a room , hundreds of people would stand to pay her respect . ''
wb.eng_0015.26
Considering that his life savings will run out in two months , that he ca n't work legally in Jordan , and that he could be deported at any moment , Abather is remarkably stoic , though the anxiety leaks out in tics .
wb.eng_0015.27
He chain - smokes cheap Craven A cigarettes , crushing the charred filters in an overflowing ashtray ;
wb.eng_0015.28
when Balqes complains , he sheepishly offers that `` smoking is my only work . ''
wb.eng_0015.29
It 's not quite true --
wb.eng_0015.30
his one other job during the past 18 months has been recounting his nightmare , over and over again , to border guards , embassy workers , and aid agencies .
wb.eng_0015.31
In December , he reluctantly told it to me , pulling documents from a worn leather folder to corroborate the details .
wb.eng_0015.32
The story began after the ouster of Saddam , when Abather and Balqes , like many Iraqis , launched a de-Baathification program of their own .
wb.eng_0015.33
Their target was the dean who had been Balqes ' boss at Baghdad University ( and who , as Abather tells it , had forced her out when she resisted joining the Baath Party ) .
wb.eng_0015.34
Balqes wanted her job back ;
wb.eng_0015.35
one day Abather confronted the dean ,
wb.eng_0015.36
and tempers flared .
wb.eng_0015.37
American soldiers broke up the brawl , bound Abather 's wrists with a zip tie , and interrogated him .
wb.eng_0015.38
He explained Balqes ' gripe and what the loss of her job had meant for their family , including their 3 - year - old son and Balqes ' 14 - year - old son from a previous marriage ( her first husband had been killed in the Iran - Iraq War ) .
wb.eng_0015.39
Though he held a master 's degree in engineering , Abather had n't been able to get a job in the doldrums of sanctions - era Iraq ,
wb.eng_0015.40
so he was scraping together a living repairing watches , his wife and children crammed into his father 's small home .
wb.eng_0015.41
`` The soldiers were very understanding , '' Abather recalls .
wb.eng_0015.42
`` I was impressed . ''
wb.eng_0015.43
They offered the family an apartment in a place called Iraqi Village , a compound near the Baghdad airport where Saddam had housed orphans he was grooming to become fedayeen loyalists .
wb.eng_0015.44
In return , the couple translated for the Americans , and eventually the Washington National Guard 's 1st Battalion 303rd Armored Regiment hired Balqes as an interpreter , at $ 15 per day .
wb.eng_0015.45
Abather ended up leading a U.S. Army - contracted security squad with a monthly salary of $ 130 .
wb.eng_0015.46
Learning that he was an engineer , soldiers later gave him lucrative reconstruction assignments .
wb.eng_0015.47
He started an engineering firm and worked with contractors such as ABB and Kellogg , Brown and Root ;
wb.eng_0015.48
in one heady year , Abather 's contracts would mushroom from a few thousand dollars to an $ 862,000 electrification project ( later canceled because he could n't procure the needed equipment ) .
wb.eng_0015.49
Abather and Balqes glow with wonder when they speak of those days , of earning a good living and having their own home for the first time .
wb.eng_0015.50
Most of all , Abather enjoyed hanging out with the Americans .
wb.eng_0015.51
He seems to remember every soldier he ever met :
wb.eng_0015.52
Captain Philips and Sergeant Buchard gave his children toys , a soccer ball , and school stationery ;
wb.eng_0015.53
Lieutenant Glenn Allen got so close to the family they called him `` Uncle Allen . ''
wb.eng_0015.54
( Allen confirmed Abather 's story in emails to me , calling him and Balqes `` very helpful individuals '' who `` risked their lives by meeting with us . '' )
wb.eng_0015.55
It was as if they had suddenly found themselves citizens of the 51st state .
wb.eng_0015.56
And so , in October 2004 , when Abather got his first death threat , he thought it was a joke .
wb.eng_0015.57
It was handwritten , tucked under the windshield wiper of his car inside Iraqi Village , a gated community with American checkpoints at both its entrances ;
wb.eng_0015.58
The note read :
wb.eng_0015.59
Abather , Leave your work with the Americans .
wb.eng_0015.60
Otherwise you will be killed by jihadis because you are a traitor .
wb.eng_0015.61
Jihad Army
wb.eng_0015.62
Then the killings began .
wb.eng_0015.63
Lieutenant Allen had once given Abather a photo depicting two American soldiers with five of their Iraqi friends .
wb.eng_0015.64
Three of the Iraqis were assassinated in short order .
wb.eng_0015.65
Abather began to notice cars following him ,
wb.eng_0015.66
and a few times shots were fired at his car .
wb.eng_0015.67
The anonymous notes grew increasingly menacing .
wb.eng_0015.68
Eventually , Iraqi Village felt so dangerous that Abather and Balqes moved the family back to his father 's house .
wb.eng_0015.69
A death threat arrived there almost immediately .
wb.eng_0015.70
Still Abather continued working with the Americans .
wb.eng_0015.71
One day in August 2005 , Abather was driving Balqes , six months pregnant with their second child , to a doctor 's appointment .
wb.eng_0015.72
At an intersection , he noticed a gold car parked by the road ;
wb.eng_0015.73
suddenly the two men in it leveled guns at him .
wb.eng_0015.74
`` This is the end , '' Abather thought ,
wb.eng_0015.75
and then a U.S. patrol appeared
wb.eng_0015.76
and the assailants vanished into traffic .
wb.eng_0015.77
Within days , Abather and Balqes had sold off their belongings and fled to Amman .
wb.eng_0015.78
Their troubles had only just begun .
wb.eng_0015.79
The U.S. Embassy in Amman is an attractive , Arabian - style fortress , heavily guarded machine - gunners in Ford pickups .
wb.eng_0015.80
It sits high on a hillside ,
wb.eng_0015.81
and the view is so phenomenal that you can imagine your gaze reaching all the way to the Iraqi border , some 200 miles away .
wb.eng_0015.82
In the foreground , Amman 's rolling mosaic of pale , boxy limestone buildings shimmers against the azure sky .
wb.eng_0015.83
At its edges , in dank apartments on outlying hillsides , lives a substantial portion of Baghdad 's educated middle class .
wb.eng_0015.84
Almost all fled in a panic , after getting death threats or seeing loved ones murdered ;
wb.eng_0015.85
many were targeted by insurgents or jihadis because they supported , or worked for , the Americans .
wb.eng_0015.86
Of Iraq 's 27 million prewar population , about 1 in 8 -- some 3.4 million people -- have left their homes since the invasion , according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees ( unhcr ) ,
wb.eng_0015.87
and more than half of those have ended up abroad .
wb.eng_0015.88
Refugees International labels this the world 's fastest - growing humanitarian crisis .
wb.eng_0015.89
Yet the Bush administration has refused to so much as acknowledge the refugees ' plight , let alone help them get to safety or even provide basic humanitarian aid .
wb.eng_0015.90
In the past , notes Bill Frelick , refugee policy director at Human Rights Watch , the United States has often aided those persecuted for supporting it ;
wb.eng_0015.91
since the Vietnam War , 1 million Vietnamese refugees have been resettled in the United States , including tens of thousands of South Vietnamese army veterans .
wb.eng_0015.92
But the Bush administration `` has abdicated that obligation , '' says Frelick .
wb.eng_0015.93
`` The people who have fled are the ones the administration was relying on to build democracy in Iraq ;
wb.eng_0015.94
it would rather ignore them than acknowledge that its initiative has failed . ''
wb.eng_0015.95
It was in Jordan that Abather and Balqes discovered the limitations of their friendship with the United States .
wb.eng_0015.96
Lieutenant `` Uncle '' Allen had emailed the embassy in Amman to explain that the family feared for their lives ;
wb.eng_0015.97
he 'd even offered to sponsor their relocation `` to the safety of the United States . ''
wb.eng_0015.98
An unsigned email from the embassy commended Allen -- '' I know that your Iraqi friends appreciate your friendship '' -- but noted that U.S. visas are `` quite difficult '' for Iraqis to get .
wb.eng_0015.99
Since 9 / 11 , Middle Easterners in general , and Iraqis in particular , have faced enormous hurdles getting admitted to the United States ;
wb.eng_0015.100
until 2005 , the Bush administration maintained a total freeze on Iraqis that shut out current refugees as well as hundreds of people who had fled Saddam Hussein 's regime years earlier .
wb.eng_0015.101
The email nonetheless provided instructions on getting a tourist visa ,
wb.eng_0015.102
and Abather and Balqes quickly filed their application along with the $ 200 fee -- almost two months ' rent .
wb.eng_0015.103
Several months later they were notified that they could visit the United States for up to three months , but that they could not bring their children .
wb.eng_0015.104
They then made repeated visits to the unhcr to apply for official refugee status .
wb.eng_0015.105
As it has with almost 99 percent of the Iraqis who have come through its office in Amman , the agency turned them down .
wb.eng_0015.106
Abather and Balqes set their sights on a visa to Australia , a major destination for Iraqi refugees , and even hired an Iraqi lawyer there .
wb.eng_0015.107
They waited for months .
wb.eng_0015.108
Their savings dwindled ;
wb.eng_0015.109
then their baby fell ill ,
wb.eng_0015.110
and the emergency surgery , for an intestinal obstruction , cost $ 2,100 in cash .
wb.eng_0015.111
In early June 2006 , Abather got a rejection letter from Australia .
wb.eng_0015.112
Around the same time , word came that his father had died of a heart attack .
wb.eng_0015.113
So he went back to Iraq to bury his father , help his mother find a place to live , and buy state - subsidized medicine for his daughter .
wb.eng_0015.114
But when he returned to the Jordanian border less than a week later , he was told he could n't reenter the country :
wb.eng_0015.115
Having recently suffered two terrorist attacks , Jordan had enacted a ban on entry for Iraqi men aged 17 to 35 .
wb.eng_0015.116
For two days Abather stood on the highway at the border post , beseeching successive shifts of immigration officials .
wb.eng_0015.117
Finally , a guard promised to send the medicine to his family in Amman if he would just go away .
wb.eng_0015.118
Once again Abather headed back to Baghdad .
wb.eng_0015.119
Driving in Baghdad a few days later , he noticed a bmw -- the Iraqi gangster 's vehicle of choice -- in his rearview mirror , closing in .
wb.eng_0015.120
The car forced him off the road ;
wb.eng_0015.121
armed men blindfolded him and knocked him unconscious .
wb.eng_0015.122
When he woke up , he was in a tiny room , handcuffed to a chair .
wb.eng_0015.123
Masked men came and went , videotaping as they cursed him as a traitor .
wb.eng_0015.124
They whipped him with a steel cable ;
wb.eng_0015.125
six months later , his back was still etched by deep , evenly spaced grooves .
wb.eng_0015.126
`` We 've been searching for you for a year , '' his captors told him .
wb.eng_0015.127
Abather recognized the voice of one man , an acquaintance from Iraqi Village who had seemed to befriend the Americans .
wb.eng_0015.128
`` I 'm sorry your father passed away , '' the man said .
wb.eng_0015.129
Soon , a bearded imam sentenced Abather to decapitation for collaborating with the United States .
wb.eng_0015.130
Abather barely heard the proceedings .
wb.eng_0015.131
`` I was thinking the whole time about my little daughter in Amman . ''
wb.eng_0015.132
He was told he could save himself by spying on the Americans , but he refused .
wb.eng_0015.133
On the eighth day , the men asked if there was anything he wanted before he died ;
wb.eng_0015.134
then they put him on the floor in the back of the bmw and sped off .
wb.eng_0015.135
Suddenly , Abather heard gunshots .
wb.eng_0015.136
The men shouted .
wb.eng_0015.137
The car crashed ,
wb.eng_0015.138
and everything went black .
wb.eng_0015.139
He woke up in a hospital bed 60 miles from Baghdad ;
wb.eng_0015.140
Iraqi forces had attacked the bmw and pulled him from the burning wreck .
wb.eng_0015.141
He had a compound fracture in his leg and severe burns all over his body ,
wb.eng_0015.142
but the nurses urged him to leave :
wb.eng_0015.143
His captors would be looking for him .
wb.eng_0015.144
His brother -- who had received a ransom note from the kidnappers , complete with a photo of Abather bound and gagged -- brought him back to Baghdad , where doctors fused a piece of plastic onto his shin and grafted skin from his thighs over his wounds .
wb.eng_0015.145
A few weeks later , he was back at the Jordanian border ,
wb.eng_0015.146
and this time the guards took pity .
wb.eng_0015.147
The family had n't told Balqes of the kidnapping .
wb.eng_0015.148
But when she saw her disfigured husband , she says , `` I knew right away what happened . ''
wb.eng_0015.149
On a crisp , clear day this past December , clutching a sheaf of papers documenting Abather and Balqes ' ordeal -- contracts , soldiers ' recommendations , death threats , a missing - person report -- I headed to American Citizen Services at the U.S. Embassy in Amman .
wb.eng_0015.150
Abather and Balqes had made several pilgrimages there ;
wb.eng_0015.151
they were convinced that if only they could speak to an American , Abather 's charred and mangled flesh would make their case , but they had never gotten past the Jordanian security guards .
wb.eng_0015.152
Outside the embassy , I joined a chatty , eclectic crowd of Americans : a retired hippie turned English teacher from Vermont ; a woman with a New York accent who struggled through the narrow eye - slit in her black veil to keep track of her hyperactive daughter ; a white - bearded man in a Santa hat , who said he was picking up his passport before returning to the North Pole .
wb.eng_0015.153
I wondered whether any of us would risk our lives for the United States as Abather and Balqes had .
wb.eng_0015.154
To get past the compound 's first wall , we navigated a metal detector , a body frisk , and an X-ray machine ;
wb.eng_0015.155
after crossing a 30 - foot no man 's land we repeated the process at the second wall .
wb.eng_0015.156
Then we waited to be called .
wb.eng_0015.157
The United States admits more refugees than any country in the world ,
wb.eng_0015.158
but in 2006 , only 202 Iraqis were allowed in ,
wb.eng_0015.159
and most of them had fled persecution under Saddam before the war .
wb.eng_0015.160
This year , millions of Iraqis , Tibetans , Sri Lankans , and Afghans must compete for a mere 5,500 refugee slots Congress has allocated for the Middle East and South Asia .
wb.eng_0015.161
The Iraqis are in line behind their compatriots who have been waiting in Jordan since the late 1990s .
wb.eng_0015.162
Like other Western representatives , U.S. officials here refer displaced people to the unhcr , which is charged with determining whether someone is a real refugee , and if so , with finding him a safe place to go .
wb.eng_0015.163
Except that , as Amman unhcr head Robert Breen told me , a 1998 agreement with Jordan forbids the agency from classifying anyone as a refugee whom it ca n't get out of the country within six months -- an impossibility in the post / 11 world .
wb.eng_0015.164
( A country of about 6 million , Jordan has long had the world 's highest refugee population per capita , hosting more than a million Palestinians who fled Israel in 1948 and were supposed to stay only a short time . )
wb.eng_0015.165
Of the 21,000 Iraqi asylum seekers the office has registered since the U.S. invasion , only 291 have been granted refugee status ; meanwhile the line outside the unhcr 's gates gets longer every week ,
wb.eng_0015.166
and the wait for an interview stands at five months .
wb.eng_0015.167
To care for all of the region 's displaced Iraqis , the agency had a total budget of $ 22 million in 2006 -- less than $ 7 a person , which must cover not only the Kafkaesque registration programs but also basic survival aid to refugees trapped in desert camps or squatting in abandoned buildings .
wb.eng_0015.168
Recognizing the potential for `` severe humanitarian suffering , '' the Iraq Study Group in December recommended that `` the United States take the lead '' in funding the UNHCR 's Iraq program ;
wb.eng_0015.169
currently it donates no more than a quarter of the budget .
wb.eng_0015.170
Direct U.S. aid to the refugees consists of a tiny grant to the Catholic relief organization Caritas ( see `` How to Help , '' page 68 ) .
wb.eng_0015.171
At the embassy , I recounted Abather and Balqes ' ordeal at Window 3 , then at Window 1 -- the setup was similar to visitation in a high - security prison .
wb.eng_0015.172
Then , at Window 4 , I told the story again to the consul general , who stood behind the bulletproof glass wearing a telephone headset .
wb.eng_0015.173
I was expecting to hear that `` the United States is doing its best to help , ''
wb.eng_0015.174
but there was only silence as the consul 's eyes welled up .
wb.eng_0015.175
( An Amman - based aid worker later told me that American diplomats are so distraught by the policies they are charged with representing that `` it just takes a few gin and tonics and they 'll break down . '' )
wb.eng_0015.176
Finally , the consul said , `` We hear stories like this all the time .
wb.eng_0015.177
We have enormous empathy for the Iraqis who 've suffered after working with the Americans ,
wb.eng_0015.178
but there 's really nothing the embassy can do for them . ''
wb.eng_0015.179
She handed me a document outlining Congress ' sole concession to people like Abather and Balqes : visas for up to 50 military translators from Iraq or Afghanistan each year .
wb.eng_0015.180
`` But do n't get their hopes up , '' she added quickly ;
wb.eng_0015.181
there were thousands with the same story .
wb.eng_0015.182
`` This is something Congress really needs to address , '' she said as we parted .
wb.eng_0015.183
The administration certainly does n't seem inclined to take the initiative .
wb.eng_0015.184
Philip A. Frayne , an embassy spokesman in Amman , told me that `` there are no reliable figures '' on how many people have fled Iraq , and that in any case , it was Saddam who drove out `` a large percentage '' of them .
wb.eng_0015.185
Likewise , in its 2006 annual refugee report to Congress , the State Department focused mainly on those Saddam - era exiles , and blithely intoned , `` It is hoped that significant numbers of Iraqi refugees will soon be able to return home , although the security situation will remain an important consideration . ''
wb.eng_0015.186
The report ignored the fact that , according to a survey by the nonprofit U.S. Committee for Refugees , 644,500 new refugees entered Jordan and Syria in 2005 alone .
wb.eng_0015.187
And 2006 will likely be worse .
wb.eng_0015.188
As much as a quarter of greater Amman 's population is now Iraqi ,
wb.eng_0015.189
and the crowds have exacerbated the city 's severe water shortage .
wb.eng_0015.190
Prices have skyrocketed .
wb.eng_0015.191
Until recently Iraqi children could n't attend Jordanian schools ,
wb.eng_0015.192
and their parents can not legally work ;
wb.eng_0015.193
easily identified by their dialect , Iraqis are discriminated against and terrified of deportation .
wb.eng_0015.194
Some refugees never go outside .
wb.eng_0015.195
Jordanian government spokesman Nasser S. Judeh told me that his country , a staunch U.S. ally and aid recipient , `` certainly needs help , and has held discussions with U.S. diplomats '' about this issue .
wb.eng_0015.196
Incidentally , Human Rights Watch has also called upon the Gulf Arab states to pitch in ;
wb.eng_0015.197
Saudi Arabia 's response so far has been to plan construction of a 560 - mile wall along its border with Iraq .
wb.eng_0015.198
Before I left Jordan , Abather invited me to visit his family and a physician friend from Baghdad who shares their two - room basement apartment .
wb.eng_0015.199
On the Al Zawraa TV channel from Baghdad , we watched U.S. Army vehicles disappear behind roadside bomb blasts as a man sang , `` Let 's go kill the Americans ! ''
wb.eng_0015.200
The channel 's endless stream of anti-American propaganda perplexed Abather and his friends :
wb.eng_0015.201
`` Why does the United States allow this ? '' they inquired .
wb.eng_0015.202
When images of dead children supposedly killed by the Americans hit the screen , Abather 's friend switched to a channel on which voluptuous Arab women danced in an un-Islamic way .
wb.eng_0015.203
Balqes served Iraqi coffee ,
wb.eng_0015.204
and to keep the baby from playing with the colorful cups , Abather suspended her from an elastic swing above our heads .
wb.eng_0015.205
She giggled as he bounced her by her tiny foot .
wb.eng_0015.206
This is her prison , he joked .
wb.eng_0015.207
Six months after the kidnapping , he still had n't gotten the surgery he needed to heal his burned flesh ;
wb.eng_0015.208
if the wounds become infected , he could die .
wb.eng_0015.209
Abather rarely complained .
wb.eng_0015.210
God is testing us , he said .
wb.eng_0015.211
But we will get through it .
wb.eng_0015.212
He looked at the girl bouncing from the ceiling and smiled .
wb.eng_0015.213
I have a daughter ,
wb.eng_0015.214
and I 'm very happy .
wb.eng_0015.215
Balqes was more fearful -- twice in the past month , suspicious men had shown up at the apartment .
wb.eng_0015.216
Iraq , she worried , had already caught up with them .
wb.eng_0015.217
How to Help
wb.eng_0015.218
Very few organizations are working on getting aid to Iraqi refugees , and of those that are , many are too small or too beleaguered to accept individual donations ;
wb.eng_0015.219
the Iraqi Red Crescent , for example , has suffered bombings and mass kidnappings , yet its volunteers continue to deliver aid to displaced families inside Iraq .
wb.eng_0015.220
One of the larger relief organizations working with the refugees is the Catholic group Caritas , whose caseworkers I shadowed while in Amman .
wb.eng_0015.221
Bucking the image of the Land Rover - driving aid worker , they made their rounds in an aging gray Honda , its roof eaten through by rust .
wb.eng_0015.222
They visited Iraqi doctors , engineers , and executives desperate for food , heat , or blankets to fend off the desert winter ;
wb.eng_0015.223
one family told the crew they had just sold their stove to buy food .
wb.eng_0015.224
Caritas helps a few thousand families a year ,
wb.eng_0015.225
but the demand far outstrips the money available to us , says Magy Mahrous , who oversees the project .
wb.eng_0015.226

At first , I signed up for a blog on DONEWS , thinking that it was a site for IT professionals where I could perhaps find friends more easily .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0003.2
Later , I signed up for another one on MSN , feeling that writing on MSN might make it easier for me to communicate directly with my MSN pals .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0003.3
But gradually , I discovered that both sites were not very good .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0003.4
At that time , DONEWS did not have the function of tallying traffic statistics ( I have the habit of looking at the statistics of everything ) ; and even though MSN had that function , others needed to sign on to MSN before they could reply , this meant that after reading the entries , many could not reply even if they wanted to , hence largely reducing the interactive element .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0003.5
The enthusiasm with writing the blog at the beginning was short - lived ; after writing a few original articles for promotion , I did not continue anymore .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0003.6
At that time , I did n't think about posting articles from other sites as I felt that there was no need to post any articles if I could not come up with anything original ; this meant that sometimes for over two months I did n't even update a new entry .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0003.7
Later , there were also some minor problems with both MSN and DONEWS , so I became more unwilling to post new articles .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0003.8
So , these two blogs have not really been very popular , either

One of the hypotheses states : a long time ago , in order to hide from wild beasts roaming on the land , humans had ever lived in shallow water regions for a long period of time , surviving on aquatic plants and fishes .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0006.2
Therefore , the body hairs , which increased the friction in water , had fallen off .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0006.3
The reason for this explanation is that the fine hairs on the back of humans run from one side of the shoulder toward the spine , a different direction from that of monkeys .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0006.4
Only such a direction could reduce the friction in water , and provide more buoyancy for the person who is swimming in the water .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0006.5
However , in all the primitive gathering settlements that have been discovered so far , we have not seen any settlement where people lived in such a way .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0006.6
What is worse is -- from the perspective of the direction of the fine hairs as well -- the fine hairs on humans ' upper arm point downward , while the fine hairs on the lower arm point upward , which is to say , they all run toward the elbow .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0006.7
This is somewhat similar to monkeys who have hairs : when it rains , they would hold their heads with their hands , and such a direction of their hairs would be easier for the rain to flow away along their elbows

Earlier on , Iran 's involvement with the Euro - for - oil transactions turned out to be a big news item with negligible after - effects , and finally it became a non-issue , and hence there was no problem for Iran and the United States .

But this time , Putin came up with a Ruble - for - oil proposal , and even began intensive preparations .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0015.4
Nobody would have any doubts about the technical capacity of Russia , not to mention its ability to protect its own resources and trade systems ,
wb.p2.5_c2e_0015.5
The intimidation that Russia had inflicted on Ukraine is still remembered with a tinge of fear by some European brother - like countries .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0015.6
The Ruble is allowed to float freely now , but everyone still has sufficient reasons to doubt the replacement of the US dollar in Dollar - for - oil .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0015.7
But what was more vicious about Comrade Putin was that he had rolled out what is known as a " barbarous " gold system ; and that is , before the wide acceptance of the Ruble - for - oil , a portion of Russia 's annual oil revenues would be channeled toward increasing the country 's holdings of gold .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0015.8
This is the first among all major countries to have issued such a clear proclamation - no wonder the recent link between gold and oil had almost been severed .

Following the government 's announcement of new immigration regulations , all travelers arriving in New Zealand will receive the same treatment as they would receive when going to the US .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0037.2
When they enter the country , they will be asked to provide biometric information .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0037.3
At a press conference this afternoon , new immigration law confirmed by Immigration Minister David Cunliffe will give immigration officials the power to collect , store and use biometric information of non-New Zealand citizens .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0037.4
These so - called non-New Zealand citizens include people with a tourist , temporary or residency visa .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0037.5
These new regulations are very similar to procedures for entering the US .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0037.6
The new immigration law also permits the immigration service to provide " limited " biometric information on New Zealand citizens to neighboring countries .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0037.7
However , the law does not explain the reason .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0037.8
Cunliffe said , it has presently not been decided when or how the biometric information will be collected from people 's bodies .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0037.9
The government has introduced legislation that will permit further collection of DNA samples from people 's bodies .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0037.10
The new regulation on biometric information is only one article among the sixty - one articles that make up the new regulations .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0037.11
Cunliffe said the new regulations will effectively simplify border - entry procedures and protect citizens ' right and international human rights .

In New Westminster , a homicide occurred yesterday in an apartment where many Chinese reside ,
wb.p2.5_c2e_0038.2
A youth in his 20s was suspected to have been seriously attacked after he left a party ; he was found lying in one of the apartment units , and was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0038.3
After the event , two men were detained by the police to assist in the investigations , the motive of the murder remains unclear , and the case is now referred to the Provincial Integrated Homicide Investigation Team for further investigations .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0038.4
According to the spokesman for the Provincial Integrated Homicide Investigation Team , Dale Carr , the crime scene was in an apartment unit on the 800 block of Agnes Street ( Agnes St. ) in New Westminster .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0038.5
The police received an emergency 911 call at 12:20 a.m. yesterday , and rushed to the address mentioned above to investigate .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0038.6
When the police arrived at the scene , they found an injured man lying in the unit ; he was seriously wounded , and certified dead upon arrival at the hospital .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0038.7
The body was sent to the coroner for an autopsy in order to determine the cause of death .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0038.8
For now , the police will not announce the name of the victim ; it will be decided upon only after the family is notified .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0038.9
As to the cause of the victim 's death , and whether the case is linked to any illegal activities and others and etc. , the police declined comment .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0038.10
Carr also said that the police had applied for a search warrant from the court yesterday morning , and entered the unit in the afternoon with the warrant for a detailed investigation , in order to understand more about the incident .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0038.11
Investigators from the Identification Bureau also went to collect information from the scene later ,

As to the motive of the attack , and whether the police had found the weapon , the police have declined disclosure .

In the face of criticism and nitpicking , I believe that Jesus is weaker than Darwin .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0046.2
Why ?
wb.p2.5_c2e_0046.3
Because Darwin was allowed to make mistakes , since he was a human being ; but Jesus was not allowed to make mistakes , since he had been described as God .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0046.4
Darwin proposed Evolution Theory , but it was just a theory , and he himself also admitted that there were many questions ,
wb.p2.5_c2e_0046.5
Others may agree with him , or they may accept some parts while disagreeing with other parts , or in the future we might discover that the general direction of Darwin 's evolution is largely correct though filled with a lot of errors , and that there might be an improved version of evolution which is more accurate and comprehensive than what Darwin had proposed .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0046.6
But as the originator , Darwin deserves much credit .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0046.7
Jesus is God , and the Bible is the word of God .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0046.8
God creates everything , understands everything , predicts the future , and is infinitely resourceful , so how can he be wrong !
wb.p2.5_c2e_0046.9
Therefore , if you find a sentence that is allegedly said by God , but effectively turns out to be wrong , then this god will be overthrown .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0046.10
Therefore , Jesus is more vulnerable to criticism than Darwin , because once an error is found , then he could not be the true god .

After the collapse of Saddam Hussein 's dictatorial regime , Iraqi religious forces had entered a period of revitalization and expansion ,
wb.p2.5_c2e_0058.2
Although the distribution system of the new legislative power in Iraq had generally taken care of the interests of all parties , and found a relatively reasonable balance point among all ethnic groups and sects -- otherwise a management committee , the interim constitution , and the current interim government would not have been successfully generated -- this does not mean that there were no contradictions among them .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0058.3
From an internal point of view , Shiites and Kurds tend to see eye to eye on the political and economic benefits , and Iraqi politics had almost become the arena of these two factions ,
wb.p2.5_c2e_0058.4
Although under the balance of interests some of Sunni political figures were involved in politics , what the Sunni radical groups were most concerned about was that the Shiites would turn around and suppress them in the future .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0058.5
In February of this year , a radical Sunni organization attacked the Ali Mosque , which is the religious shrine of Shiite Muslims , and this led to the eruption of the conflict between Iraq 's two largest parties .

The assassination of the Lebanese Minister of Industry has triggered off angry protests from supporters , plunging Lebanon into yet another precarious situation .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0063.2
In merely two short years , this minister is the fifth senior official to be assassinated ; this shows that even after the forced withdrawal of Israeli troops , long - suffering Lebanon still has n't ushered in the peace that it hoped for yet .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0063.3
The United States claimed that the Syrian government was the murderer , but Syria retorted by saying that the accusation was " totally without foundation , and in disregard of facts . "
wb.p2.5_c2e_0063.4
At this moment , the real murderer is probably tittering , but the world has clearly seen that any one of the regimes of Lebanese and Iraqi is more fragile than the other .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0063.5
The Western media said that in the " post-Bush " garbage era , countries like Iraq , Syria , and Lebanon will encounter a lot more good shows or terrible tragedies .

It is uncertain whether the Canadian Prime Minister had taken the political equivalent of Viagra , or had lost his mind due to political biases , but he " lost his temper " several times in China during APEC , and almost messed up his meeting with President Hu .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0063.8
Fortunately President Hu was magnanimous enough not to take it to heart , and gave him the honor of a 15 - minute meeting .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0063.9
However , when this fellow returned to his own country , he boasted recklessly by saying that his meeting with President Hu had " important historical significance , " and even exaggerated by claiming it as his " major diplomatic achievement . "
wb.p2.5_c2e_0063.10
But those Canadian opponents already disgruntled with him , seeing through his tricks , could immediately tell that the meetings that President Hu had such as with Bush , Abe , and Putin all lasted over an hour ; a mere 15 - minute meeting with you -- excluding the pleasantries and translations -- was no different from an extended hand - shake .

This early morning the soccer match between the Chinese women 's team and the Korean team had indeed made me excited , I was surprised by the match 's brilliance , and I also gained a new understanding of the Korean team .

They attacked swiftly and fearlessly and coordinated with tacit understanding , but looking back at the Chinese women 's soccer team , it was in an inferior position either in time - control or coordination .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0069.3
We lost this game with no complaints .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0069.4
But looking at the match between the Chinese men 's soccer team and the Iranians , that goal -- the insulting , provocative , and perverse goal -- made me question the quality of the Iranian team and even of the people in that country .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0069.5
The Chinese team showed their guts during this game ; they manifested the courage and fighting spirit of Chinese people .
wb.p2.5_c2e_0069.6
We did not shy away from the powerful Iranian team , but did our best ; it was n't until after an overtime and two rounds of penalty kicks that we then regretfully lost the match .

[] A high school teacher teaching chemistry in the United Kingdom has appealed to the Department of Education to allow the views and theories that God created everything and intellectual life created the world to be introduced into school to be taught to students together along with Darwin 's theory of evolution , which has been dominating the scientific community since the 19th century , and let students judge between right and wrong for themselves .

[] Also some Western scholars - such as paleontologists and archaeologists from the United Kingdom , France , and Germany in the 19th and 20th centuries - have long made use of the distorted theory of evolution and social Darwinism derived from the argument to attempt to prove their point that certain races are more advanced than others .

After the successful implementation of a " soft landing " , the rumbling train of China 's economy is running forward smoothly at high speed .
nw.chtb_0112.3
" Proper , quick and stable " growth will become the main theme of this year 's economic development .
nw.chtb_0112.4
Official authorities revealed that this year the Chinese government determined that the economic growth rate was 8 % and price levels will be controlled within 3 % .
nw.chtb_0112.5
This means that the whole economic operation situation will maintain a healthy pattern of " high growth and low inflation " .
nw.chtb_0112.6
People in economic circles seem to be more optimistic about the economic outlook .
nw.chtb_0112.7
The growth rate , predicted by concerned experts of the State Planning Commission , the Statistical Bureau and the China Academy of Social Sciences , is mostly 1 to 2 percentage points higher than governmental plans .
nw.chtb_0112.8
Of course , to a relatively large extent , this depends on aggregate control of using monetary policy as a primary means , or in other words , under the major premises of general tightening , how financial control should timely and reasonably conduct fine tuning .
nw.chtb_0112.9
Moreover , the impact of Southeast Asia 's financial crisis should not be underestimated .
nw.chtb_0112.10
On the part of the government , the keynote of a moderately tight macro-economic policy will not be changed .
nw.chtb_0112.11
The key of the current economy is not striving for a higher growth rate , but is adjusting structures and increasing benefits so as to make macro controls which were implemented from the second half year of 1993 obtain greater achievements and push the national economy onto a road of constant , rapid and healthy development .
nw.chtb_0112.12
Actually , as main obstacles that restrained economic growth in the past several years -- inflation and the " bottleneck " of basic industries have all been evidently relieved and the macro-economic situation tends to loosen , China 's economic development is in a relatively favorable period .
nw.chtb_0112.13
This year , China plans to create an effective pulling force to economic growth through maintaining a moderate and stable growth of investment , consumption and exports .
nw.chtb_0112.14
Fixed assets investments will grow by 10 % this year , total volumes of retail sales of social consumer products by 10 % and export growth by 8 % .

After bidding farewell to the age of " the shortage economy " , relations between commodity 's supply and demand have changed from a " buyers ' market " to an integrated " sellers ' market " and competition will be intensified .
nw.chtb_0112.17
Hence , activating the consumer market , especially the wide rural market , cultivating consumer hotspots and new economic growth points appear to be particularly urgent .
nw.chtb_0112.18
Along with comprehensively implementing hardship relief measures taken towards large and medium - sized State owned enterprises , the pace of State owned enterprise reforms will be accelerated greatly , the dynamics of bankruptcies , mergers and assets restructuring will be strengthened , and enterprise deficits are estimated to decrease by 20 % and a number of competitive large and medium - sized State owned enterprises will gradually form .
nw.chtb_0112.19
However , the large amount of worker layoffs that will accompany this will cause unemployment pressure to gradually increase .
nw.chtb_0112.20
China has determined to appropriately place laid - off workers and to strive to control the unemployment rate to within 3.5 % through implementation of a large scale " re-employment " project .

According to estimates , after three years in a row of bumper harvests , if this year 's measures are effective , agriculture still has hope of achieving a good harvest .

Currently , the degree of dependence on the outside of China 's economy has reached 42 % , and the space of utilizing overseas markets and resources is in the process of expanding , but is more easily subject to the influences of the international environment .
nw.chtb_0112.24
Under the circumstances of a relative steady domestic demand , the pulling effect of the trend of foreign trade towards economic development is more striking .
nw.chtb_0112.25
Taking all factors as a whole , this year 's amount of foreign trade will be increased steadily , the import will be increased and the increasing speed of the export will be somewhat slowed down .
nw.chtb_0112.26
People in economic circles said that China should adopt positive and steady measures to solve outstanding problems in economic operations , and special attention should be given to clear up bad assets in time and strengthen financial risk prevention .

nw.chtb_0281.3
He thinks that the Chinese government 's guidelines of planning , strategizing and implementation of the population problem and socioeconomic problems as one is correct , effective in its implementation , and successful .
nw.chtb_0281.4
Peng Li said that in the beginning of September of this year , the United Nations would hold the International Population and Development Congress in Cairo with the theme of " population , continuous economic growth and continuous development " .
nw.chtb_0281.5
This shows that the international community has increasingly recognized that population and development are inseparable , and prepare to adopt actions together .
nw.chtb_0281.6
He feels that this Congress has important meaning , and the Chinese government has given it high level attention and will be sending a delegation to attend the Congress .
nw.chtb_0281.7
Peng Li said China was the most populous developing country in the world .
nw.chtb_0281.8
The Chinese government included the population problem into the overall planning of the national economy and its social development , always emphasizing that population growth and economic development need to fit together , and be coordinated with resource utilization and environmental protection .
nw.chtb_0281.9
In light of China 's basic national condition , the Chinese government has determined planned parenthood and environmental protection as two basic national policies , implementing a population policy and planned parenthood program that suits China 's actual needs .
nw.chtb_0281.10
At the same time , the Chinese government also formulated a series of important policies and measures to realize continuous development , such as the protection of women 's legal rights and benefits , the promotion of equality among men and women , the forceful development of healthcare for women and children , the zealous elimination of poverty , and protecting the environment .
nw.chtb_0281.11
Presently , the Chinese economy is continuously growing , society is stable and united , people 's livelihood are continuously improving , and the population birth rate and the natural population growth rate has dropped to a lower level .
nw.chtb_0281.12
Peng Li said the population problem was one of the major problems currently faced by the international community .
nw.chtb_0281.13
Due to differences in country 's situations , differences in economic development levels , cultural backgrounds , historical traditions , and social systems , each country should formulate suitable , effective population policies according to the actual situation of the native country .
nw.chtb_0281.14
This is the sovereignty of each country and it should receive full respect .
nw.chtb_0281.15
He said China was in a critical period of building up a socialist market economy system and increasing the pace of its modernization build - up , but a huge , overwhelming growth in population was still restraining the social and economic development , affecting the further improvement of the living standard of the people , and has also brought about heavy pressure on the natural resources and the natural environment .
nw.chtb_0281.16
Because of this , for a fairly long period of time , at the same time as forcefully developing the economy , China will continue to pay close attention to doing well the work of family planning .
nw.chtb_0281.17
The Chinese government strongly believes that , the resolution of China 's population problem is not just being responsible for the prosperity of the Chinese race and the happiness of future generations , but is also an important contribution in stabilizing the world 's population .
nw.chtb_0281.18
For this , the Chinese government views with extreme importance and actively participates in international population activities , and sincerely hopes that the international community will adopt a stand of realistic resolution of population and development problems , seeking similarities while accommodating differences , co-operating closely to strive hard together towards a stable world population to create a beautiful future !

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0040.5
Fast forward to 2012 and now he is the liberal candidate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0040.6
Nothing change, EXCEPT the passing of Obaminationcare!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0040.7
I think you draw the wrong interpretation of 2008.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0040.8
He wasn't the most conservative, Huckabee was.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0040.9
And Huckabee was sincere.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0040.10
What you forget about all those talking heads is that they are all paid by big corporations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0040.11
The real problem is that Corporate Conservatism and Social Conservatism aren't on the same page.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0040.12
The big corporations don't give a shit about Abortion or Gay Marriage or gettin' Jay-a-zus into your life.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0040.13
They just want laws friendly to Wall Street, and Romney is that guy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0040.14
Huckabee actually believed in all that Jay-a-zus shit, and that scared the corporate guys.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0040.15
Here's the ugly little truth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0040.16
The religious right could win elections without the corporate right.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0040.17
Easily.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0040.18
They'd even have an easier time of it, because a lot of religious people vote Democrats and aren't fooled into voting against their own economic interests.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0041.1
One of the most lucid, reasonable descriptions of Romney I've seen yet, well done.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0041.2
The guy is awkward and doesn't connect.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0041.3
There are obviously plenty of people like that, it doesn't make you evil, but it's obviously a significant handicap when you're running for President.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0041.4
Add that to the fact that he just seems so eager to please, and you have a guy who isn't easy to trust.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0041.6
What?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0041.7
Liberals are finding something wrong with Romney?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0041.8
Unbelievable!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0041.9
If you want to pretend that Romney is perfect, okay, your call, I see it with partisans on both sides all the time.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0041.10
It is possible, however, to admit weaknesses in candidates from your party without being arrested.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0041.11
It is possible to be reasonable and honest, too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0041.13
Read the post I made right after that one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0041.14
Apology accepted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.1
As I'm pretty sure that the OP was asking Republican voters, I will answer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.2
Keep in mind that even though I'm a registered Republican I am decidedly Libertarian.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.3
Romney has a credibility issue with me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.4
Even after I put aside all the things that I disagree with him on (Me, being a Libertarian) I just cannot trust him to do the things I would expect of a Republican.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.5
I am not convinced that he will repeal obamacare, I am not convinced that he will reduce government spending, and I am not convinced that he will run the country like a businessman.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.6
Having followed the last 2 presidential races, (9 in total) I am familiar with Romney, and familiar with what he says compared to wht he has done and what he has said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.7
That's what is wrong with Romney, and what is right about Romney is that with all his faults, he's 10 times better than obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.8
why would you think the o/p is asking "republicans".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.9
i've voted republican enough times where i'm probably the better gauge.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.10
just sayin
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.11
thank you though for pointing out what the real problem is...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.12
it's the rightwingnut base and the difficulties of appealing to it if one is a normal moderate person.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.13
btw, you aren't a libertarian if you're anti-choice.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.14
just sayin
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.15
Jumping with both feet right into a pile of bull shit aren't you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.16
I am and have always been pro-choice all the way accross the board.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.17
In every area, I am pro choice, pro freedom.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0042.18
Which makes me an enemy of obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0043.19
then you have my apology and it makes unique among so-called "libertarians" on this board.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0043.20
carry on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0044.10
Looks like you made the post after I did, didn't you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8881981_0044.11
No apology needed.

On his TV show, early in the Clinton administration, Limbaugh put up a picture of Socks, the White House cat, and asked, 'Did you know there's a White House dog?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0036.8
' Then he put up a picture of Chelsea Clinton, who was 13 years old at the time and as far as I know had never done any harm to anyone.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0036.9
When viewers objected, he claimed, in typical Limbaugh fashion, that the gag was an accident and that without his permission some technician had put up the picture of Chelsea -- which I found as disgusting as his original attempt at humor.

all in politics.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0103.4
What I said was is that the candidates were not treated any differently by the media (and that includes pundits) based on whether they were conservative or liberal.

As with all religions, in America, you can quit and the State will not punish you nor allow anyone else to bring you to harm over it, though the community may shun you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0166.6
That's why we have New York, LA and SF. The only punishment a religious community can exert is expulsion.

Oh well.

The problem is the women in those countries dont have a choice.

The muslims who support sharia law are anti-woman, anti-gay, racist bigots.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0166.10
It sucks that the muslim moderates in this country and other countries don't speak out against those in their religion who still think backwards like this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0166.11
I find it hypocritical when many of the liberal minded people on this board support sharia law and that sect of the muslim faith, it bothers me to be honest.

Misogynist Lefties use the words "twat" and "cunt" as insults because they feel sexually inferior and are actually afraid of Real Women (and they have Mommy Issues).

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.17
Do you think that's about the same as what Schultz said?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.18
You are the biggest laughable liar.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.19
Show me where I called a woman a nazi?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.20
YOU BROUGHT UP THE SUBJECT OF NAZIS.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.21
I simply addressed it!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.22
Now you act like I brought it up?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.24
First you go FROM TELLING THE THE PREPOSTEROUS LIE that I put Hillary Clinton in cross hairs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.25
A COMPLETE LIE.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.26
Now you are going to the hysterical liberal tacitc of the third degree.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.27
Asking question after question THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME, as IF I have to justify myself to YOU!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.28
(what a joke!)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.30
You are a laughable loon.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.31
I am supposed to answer a bunch of laughable accusations when you haven't even produced the evidence FOR THE FIRST LAUGHABLE ACCUSATION???????
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.32
Where is the evidence I ever put Hillary in crosshairs?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0236.33
Still waiting, you laughable partisan hack!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.1
If they weren't Jews, what were they?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.2
Muslims, Christians, Hindi, Atheist?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.3
Just because they are Russian immigrants doesn't mean they aren't Jews.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.4
Where does it state they aren't Jews?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.5
And sorry, working outside of the home especially after having children and not being a member of the slum classes is an explicitly liberal philosophy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.6
Are you sure you are a conservative?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.7
YOU DON'T FOLLOW LINKS AND READ!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.8
Ok, and this <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=81429">Arutz Sheva article</a> indicates that he wasn't a Jew.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.9
But what about the other neo-Nazis?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.10
A non-Jewish IDF soldier who immigrated to Israel from Russia was arrested Wednesday and found to belong to a neo-Nazi organization.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.11
During the subsequent police investigation, suspicions arose that the two may have immigrated to Israel using counterfeit documents.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.12
However, due to the complex nature of Israel's Law of Return, it is possible that they arrived legitimately.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.13
The law, modeled in response to the Nazi Nuremberg Laws, gives anyone with even one Jewish grandparent the right to receive automatic Israeli citizenship.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.14
The Interior Ministry said it was checking into the matter and will consider revoking the citizenship of the two if they indeed used fraudulent documents, but warned that such action is complicated from a legal perspective.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.15
More on it here:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.17
What it boils down to is these people immigrated to Israel FOR THE PRECISE reason of causing trouble.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.18
Not everyone that lives is Israel is a Jew, and as the article notes "right of return" means if you have even the slightest heritage, you have the right of return.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.19
Under those auspices HITLER could have immigrated since his grandmother was reputedly a Jew.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.20
Your BS article falls flat.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.21
Don't trust Reuters as a main source for your information.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.22
Obviously, you can't read for comprehension.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.23
The links I have posted have nothing to do with the soldier, Dmitri Bogotich, who was being investigated for heroin with the neo-nazi link being overseas and the assailants in my link, Eli Buanitov, part of a group that was discovered in the course of investigations of swastikas and graffiti coupled with assaults in whose very words illuminate the self-hatred, "My grandfather is half Yid, so that this piece of trash won't have ancestors with even the smallest percent of Jewish blood."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.25
The fact that there are multiple stories with different players kind of refutes the ridiculousness of such a statement, eh?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.26
As an aside, exactly what publications do you believe to be "uncompromised"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.27
If Reuters, Der Spiegel, Haaretz aren't acceptable?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.28
Nice try BUT THIS IS ABOUT THE "NEO-NAZIS" case in Israel.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0237.29
Try again!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.1
Because "feminazi" WAS part of the criticism and ridicule of the National Organization of Women.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.2
Sluts was used to CHANGE THE SUBJECT and ATTACK ANYONE ACCUSING HORNDOG CLINTON.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.3
Feminazi was not used to change the subject and suggest any woman at NOW for abortion or bringing sexual harrassment cases against school children was a nymphomaniac.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.4
The "Nuts and Sluts" defense was USED PRECISELY to get the heat off Bill "couldn't keep it in his pants" Clinton and make the victims of this horndog seem to be the "guilty party."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.5
So comparing women to Nazis is acceptable if it's on topic??
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.6
Are you telling me that ONLY men were Nazis?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.16
In other words, NYcarbineer, you keep repeating the same gibberish.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.17
You repeated it again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.18
That's what teapartysamurai is showing you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.19
The term feminazi is directed at the adherents of feminism, an ideology that is ultimately premised on Marxism.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.20
It's not now and never was a derogatory term for women.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.21
It applies to male adherents of feminism too, you know, limp-wristed, leftist men.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.22
Now do you intend to go on pretending that the term applies to gender and not ideology?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.23
I can see that it ain't wise to mess with teapartysamurai ; she wields a punishing categorical logic and a wicked right punch line.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0238.24
But it's all flying right over your head.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0239.1
Sara Palin is Conservative?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0239.2
Really?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0239.3
Really?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0239.4
Conservatives have obviously been redefined, as everything else seems to have become.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.1
Recent stats show approximately 50% of women aged 15-44 have at least one unplanned pregnancy in their lives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.2
So the Republican Party wants to force half the women in America to have an unwanted child.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.6
I had an "unplanned" pregnancy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.7
My hubby and I wanted to wait until he finished college before having kids.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.8
Didn't work out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.9
We were the adults.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.10
We made the kid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.11
We weren't going to make the kid pay for our "unplanned" pregnancy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.12
We did what we had to so the kid could be born and supported.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.13
Did it EVER occur to you morons that the way to avoid "unplanned" pregnancies before marriage is simply say NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.14
Sure as hell worked for me!

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.16
There is no such thing as being responsible or taking responsibility for one's actions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.17
Nope!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.18

That's the definition of a liberal that's LOSING THE ARGUMENT.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.29
They want to desperately put you on the defensive, and they hope something will stick and put you on the defensive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.30
It's so obvious!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.32
As for "that choice doesn't be beyond the players."

WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0267.34
That abortion goes beyond "personal choice" because the Democrat party is so invested in it?

im not a progressive twat.

Same reason.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0271.29
They are terrified of a conservative women who can kick their asses.

They don't know what to do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0271.31

Thanks for letting us know that!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0275.6
As we can see from this thread, you are an imbecile who can not back none of your lies up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0275.7
Being a women shows you disrepect your own gender by displaying them in soft porn.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0275.8
And that says a lot about yourself, not about me.

As for "lies."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0275.14
When you have evidence of my "lies," let me know.

PUT UP OR SHUT UP.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0275.16
The evidence is your inability to prove your lies by backing them up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0275.17
It is you who needs to PUT UP OR SHUT UP UP.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0275.19
Just because I slamdunk you braindead liberals back to the stone age doesn't constitute a "lie."

You have failed on every lying accusation, Loser.

It just means you can't come up with anything else to refute my argument but the usual liberal baseless accusation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0275.26
It just means you are a liar who cannot prove her point, and lost this thread by being an imbecile.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0275.27
As for your charges of soft porn.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0275.28
I think that says far more about how YOU view STRONG WOMEN, than anything else.

But, as usual, with liberals, when something backfires, they never are intelligent enough to admit they goofed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0275.36
They just double down on the same stupidity and leave no doubt with anbody how without original thought or intelligence they are.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0275.47
That sounds like you Loser, unable to prove even one point with your dishonesty and lies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0276.38
IN OTHER WORDS.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0276.39
I because I beat you and your mind can't accept that happened, "I must be lying."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0276.40
The sad part is, I bet you think that really works.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0276.41
NOTICE AGAIN, PEOPLE!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0276.42
When liberals cease to even DISCUSS THE OP and just MAKE BASELESS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST YOU.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0276.43
They are admitting they have lost.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0277.6
That liberals think only a man can win the election?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0278.43
As we can see, the ignorant imbecile doesn't even know when she is lying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0278.44
That makes her a habitual liar.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0278.45
PUT UP YOUR SUPPORTING EVIDENCE OR SHUT UP LOSER!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.1
it means the choice doesnt go beyond you, your husband (or man you are with) and your doctor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.2
Nobodies else's opinion matter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.3
I dont care what the Dem party has invested in abortion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.4
The Choice is not yours to make unless it concerns you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.5
My life does and never will concern you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.6
If my wife and i decided we didnt want the child at this moment and went the abortion route, it is our choice.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.7
I dont need to ask your permission, nor hear your opinion on it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.8
If you felt you needed to state or stop us, i would not be above just decking you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.9
Stay out of other people's personal affairs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.10
I dont give a shit if you get hit by a bus tomorrow, your life is meaningless to me, and if you choose to keep or abort a child has no impact on me whatsoever.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.11
This is MY opinion and stance, Not a progressive, not a liberal, nor a democrat policy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.12
They do not speak for me, just like you will never choose what i can and can not do with my body.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.13
How are you a hypocrite?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.14
Answer these for me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.15
Are you against government removing transfats?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.16
Smoking bans?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.17
and other nannystate type situations?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.18
See someone like you is for making a law banning all Abortions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.19
You want to use government to limit peoples rights and freedoms.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.20
You will say its for the children blah blah, but the reality is you want your morals imposed on others.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.21
Oh, this is going to be EASY!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.22
I can destroy you by pointing out one little fact.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.23
IT WAS LIBERALS THAT MADE A FEDERAL LAW "BANNING."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.24
Not social conservatives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.25
You see before Roe v. Wade, each state had their own laws on abortion IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 10TH AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.26
It was not until Roe v. Wade when the "Jane Roe" (who later admitted she lied about being raped) went to the USSC and the USSC VIOLATED THE 10TH AMENDMENT making a federal law from the bench.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.27
Thus, liberals BANNED THE RIGHT OF THE STATES TO DECIDE ON THIS QUESTION, which is their legal right per the 10th Amendment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.28
Over turning the Unconstitutional, Roe v. Wade bans nothing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.29
It simply RETURNS THE QUESTION TO THE STATES, where it resided before 1973.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.30
Thus, your argument about my "hypocrisy" falls flat because it's built on your OWN IGNORANCE regarding the Constitution and the origins of Roe v. Wade.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.31
That also collapses your "it doesn't go beyond you or your husband."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.32
No, sorry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.33
The question goes TO THE STATES as noted in the 10th Amendment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.34
You want to try again, and make it even more obvious how badly you just lost on that issue?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.42
you seriously have to be one of the most stupidest fucks ever to walk this earth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.43
This wasnt a state right issue you fucking waste of air.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.44
this was about your personal belief that YOU would create a law banning Abortion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.45
Liberals didnt ban abortion you motherfucking twat, which is what we are talking about.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.46
Not your pathetic attempt to move to goal posts like you always fucking do in your attempt to debate people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.47
This is why nobody ever talks to you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.48
You just move your argument around in circles never actually landing on a point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0317.49
if i could time travel i would go back in time and pay your parents not to have you, and thus saving the world of your stupidity.

What an idiot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0318.1
Didn't you earlier say this debate wasn't about me?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0318.2
Now you want to make it about YOU?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0318.10

You should say she would 'out in a gender non-specific genital way'

she tucked tail and hightailed it out of here due to being a dumbass

I would think Fox News would punish anyone who said anything of the sort.

Let me ask you a question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.25
How many votes did Roland Burris get for his Senate seat?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.26
How many votes did the Democrat Senator from Colorado get for his seat?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.27
Zero.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.28
They were both appointed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.29
The Senator from Colorado, Michael Bennet, said over the weekend he would gladly lose his seat to pass health care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.30
I told you people this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.31
I told you the Democrats are going to thin the herd.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.32
They are gladly willing to lose members.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.33
Everybody's talking about this, "Oh, no, it's a horrible thing that happened on Saturday."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.34
Folks, it was a fait accompli.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.35
Nobody was going to vote to not do a debate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.36
I mean, even Lieberman voted for this, and he's not going to vote for the final bill.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.37
Now, when you hear a Democrat go on television and solemnly pronounce, as Senator Ben Nelson did: "No health care if no change in public option and abortion funding," or Mary Landrieu, "I will not vote for this as it is written," they are not espousing core beliefs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.38
They are simply opening bids.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.39
They are simply making opening bids to Harry Reid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.40
Mary Landrieu has now shown that she can get paid off; other people are going to have their price.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.41
So when they come along and say, "I'm not going to sign this thing as it's written.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.42
Why, I'm not going to put my signature on this!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.43
I won't vote for it if there's a public option in there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.44
I'm not going to vote for this if there's abortion funding," that's just BS. That's a signal to Harry Reid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.45
That's just their opening bid: "What will you give me to vote for this thing?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.46
How much will you give me to change my mind?"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.47
Who will write the escape statement: "I voted against it before I voted for it."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.48
This is classic what's going on here, and it's right out in the open for everybody to see.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.49
Let's see, who voted for this?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0335.50
Robert Byrd from a stretcher practically; Tim Johnson, who we're never even allowed to hear talk because he hasn't recovered from his stroke; that stooge senator who replaced Ted Kennedy.

That's the Democrat who was appointed to replace Ken Salazar.

That's your problem with depending on liberal webistes that take out of context or edit.

Problem is, I'm a 24/7 member and have access TO THE ENTIRE QUOTE.

It's pretty obvious Rush is SAYING the WHOLE DAMN PARTY MALE AND FEMALE are prostituting themselves for their vote on healthcare.

Thank you for once again reminding us how "progressive" liberals are!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0340.58
How exactly does that context change the meaning of the quote?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0340.59
Did Rush Limbaugh actually specifically call anyone else involved a "whore" or a "prostitute"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0340.60
No, he didn't, just her.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0340.61
And Schultz was also using the term slut in the context of her being a prostitute for the right-wing, not in terms of her sexual mores.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0340.62
Therefore he was saying the exact same thing that Schultz was, he just used the term "prostitute" instead of "Slut", which is equally misogynist.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0341.21
Well Damn!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882248_0341.22

The truth is, now that Ohio went to Mitt the race is all but over.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0059.2
The problem is that all of the candidates are flailing around like a chicken with their head cut off.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0059.3
Too stupid to know they're dead, but determined anyways to do as much damage as they can on the way out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0059.4
IF IF IF the nomination process ended tomorrow, Mitt might stand a fairly good shot at beating Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0059.5
But the longer this goes on, the worse his odds get.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0059.11
I'm planning on voting for Mitt in the General.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0059.12
The problem is that everyone is so concerned with winning the nomination, they're poisoning the well in the general.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0059.13
When you have a vicious hard fought primary in battleground states like Ohio and Florida, you have a lot of work to do to win back your own divided base and the Moderates who just watched you sling mud with sickening precision.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0059.14
Now, if the nomination process ended soon, Mitt could start repairing the damage he's done to himself in this process.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0059.15
But the race keeps going, keeps traveling to battleground states where he keeps damaging himself just to win.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0059.16
The general isn't a lock for Obama, but if you're thinking it'll be an easy win for the GOP you're quite frankly insane.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0059.17
Obama is going to fight hard, his proxies are going to fight hard, and right now the GOP Nomination process is doing their work for free.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0059.18
The longer this goes on, the more likely an Obama victory will be.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0059.19
I totally disagree with your thoughts on all levels.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0059.20

One thing you can't deny is that this process is flat out wasting money that should be spent in the General.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0060.21
Citizens means that Obama is going to have huge cash store in play and a pretty effective group of proxies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0060.22
Deny the damage done by the negative ads in the battleground states if you want, but even if none of that sticks come the General, the money spent is gone.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0060.23
Wasted targeting the other GOP candidates, and not Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0060.24
If Mitt wants to win, he desperately needs to get back on to attacking Obama and off of going after Santorum.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882382_0060.25
But that isn't likely to happen as no one is dropping out.

Granted, he has a habit of being a bit more abrupt, or forthright about his "screw them" attitude, as his disconnect from ordinary Americans is way more loud and proud than it was back in the day, but the overall intent is totally on target.

He is Republican, through and through, which makes him much closer to Bush and Obama than to being a conservative.

He is neither fiscally nor socially conservative despite the rhetoric he is employing to get him the nomination and a shot at the Presidency.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882462_0024.16
itll take a true 3rd party nominee (i.e. Ross Perot) to truly change the conversation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882462_0024.17
Unfortunately that also takes money and backing from the rich and powerful.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882462_0024.18
Right now, they are doing very well with the two parties they have.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882462_0024.19
They are not going to cut their noses off to spite their faces.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882462_0025.14
Work?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882462_0025.16
Well...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882462_0025.17
yeah, I guess you could say he worked it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0095.1
Is not relying on Family, friends, and charities an abdication of personal responsibility as well?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0095.2
You tell me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0095.3
No, that is what they are there for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0096.1
Paul is more interested in his "states rights" issue even after a "national" disaster.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0096.2
How is it a "national" disaster?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0096.3
If only one state was hit yet as much damage and death took place, would it no longer be a "national disaster" in your eyes?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0096.4
Do you know what a republic is?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0096.5
Do you have any idea why we are referred to as the "Unites States"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0096.6
Oh, so now it must have the official "National" disaster label before yo uare Ok with our Federal government helping out your fellow citizens?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0096.7
REALLY?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0096.8
Wow...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0096.9
Dont be a dick.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0096.10
I simply asked why it was labelled as a national disater.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0097.2
I don't see how anything you've posted disproves what I said.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0097.3
He's talking about private citizens.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0097.4
Are you saying private citizens are not the purview of the US Gov't ???
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0097.5
I'm saying that it's not the U.S. government's responsibility to give money to those hit by natural disasters.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0098.1
Isn't it interesting how Libertarians' desire for "freedom" correspond so neatly with skinflints who don't want to give ANYONE, ANYTHING.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0098.2
So while libertarianism attracts people who want to be "free" it also attracts cheap assholes who don't want to pay their fair share.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0098.3
Perhaps when Libertarians figure out a way to differentiate between the two, I'll vote for them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0098.4
What a disingenuous hack you are.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0098.5
Libertarians/Conservatives give WAAAAY more voluntarily that you do through the force of government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0098.6
You cry about "paying their fair share", all the while ignoring the FACT that we voluntarily GIVE more than you propose to TAKE.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0098.7
The reason you libs want to forcibly TAKE from others is that you look in the mirror and KNOW that you wouldn't GIVE of your own free will.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0098.8
You project YOUR shortcomings on everyone else in order to make yourselves feel better about your own tightwadery.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0098.9
FUCK YOU!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0098.10
One more example of a callous conservative.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0098.11
Who was it that claimed libealism was a mental disease?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0098.12
Oh yeah, Michael Weiner, a conservative radio host whose rants are reflective of the the anger expressed by GuyP.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0099.1
Im sorry but I agree with him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0099.2
The people should have insurance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0099.3
RENTAL insurance is cheap like 200 a year or less..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0099.4
IF you own a house you should have insurance..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0099.5
No excuses..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0099.6
I used to rent and had rental insurance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0099.7
Please explain to me how rental insurance gets you clothing, water, food, shelter, transportation, etc. right NOW, when these people need it the most?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0099.8
Apparently you don't pay attention to what people post..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0099.9
Private charities are down there making sure people get what they need.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0099.10
As one poster pointed out - restaurants are handing out free food, local stores are supplying free gloves, hard hats, people are going down there to volunteer, people are donating money to fund the effort..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0099.11
The federal government is NOT needed - they are NOT the only solution.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0099.12
When people need help - the help comes from good people - not the ugly federal government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0099.13
Besides, we don't need politicians throwing money at a community while they scratch their bellies then say; "remember me in November - you owe me."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0100.1
Consistent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.1
It likely wont.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.2
But I bet not one would go hungry or without a roof if government WAS NOT expected to help out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.3
Government gets in the way...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.4
Americans help Americans....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.5
we always had.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.6
Now?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.7
Governemnt red tape gets in the way.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.8
REALLY?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.9
SO, why did we have 131,000 homeless veterans in the 2011 data?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.10
Aren't our service personnel especially near and dear to the hearts of the right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.11
Do you have one living with you yet?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.12
If not, why not?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.13
you dont know me well enough to make that assumption.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.14
I share a mortgage on a home that I have never lived in nor do I collect rent on it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.15
I have been paying 1400 a month for 8 years for it...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.16
that incluides real estate taxes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.17
I have never net the folks that live there...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.18
I am anaonymous...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.19
my attorney handles everything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.20
The foiks that live there are veterans and their families.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.21
Sure...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.22
you can say "it is an investment"...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.23
and in a way, it is.......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.24
for when the time comes, I will sell it off.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.25
But for now, people are enjoying the conmfort of a roof over their head.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.26
FYI....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.27
there was a lien put on the property because the people did not pay their water bill for 4 years.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.28
so I paid it without questioning.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.29
So what do you do for your fellow man?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.30
Just criticize them for being like you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.31
I take care of a Vietnam Veteran.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.32
I call him "Dad".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.33
As for providing a roof, I applaud you, but until you provide concerted care and have to pay out of pocket for it all, go cry to your "attorney".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0101.34
I can't afford one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0102.8
Red cross is there and even the governor said they have more food and clothes then they can handle right now with churches and other groups sending it..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0102.9
transportation You should have auto insurance..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.1
I get what Ron Paul is saying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.2
Thats what a Hardcore Libertarian would say.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.3
But the rest of us are thinking about the people that do not have insurance and/or need help right now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.4
Kind of hard to build a house over night, Mr Paul.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.5
Kind of hard to import food considering that the stores are probably wiped out too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.6
How does one survive until the insurance(hopefully by a respectable company) claim comes through?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.7
How does one survive when you have the funds but the people you need to buy the goods from has no address?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.8
I know, you get into your pickup and drive over to the next town-- if you can find your damn pickup!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.9
Ron Paul is not opposed to private charity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.10
So nice straw man.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.11
He is opposed to charity from the government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.12
In the words of the right, a government handout.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.13
The government can't perform charity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.14
It's an impossibility.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.15
The very definition of charity requires voluntariness.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.16
Charity has to be provided of one's own free will.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.17
The government, by definition, acts through the use of force to take from people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0123.18
There is nothing voluntary about it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0124.9
Is reading really THIS difficult?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0124.10
I haven't seen any libertarian on this board or thread speak out against donating, in fact I've read the exact opposite.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0125.1
Isn't it interesting how Libertarians' desire for "freedom" correspond so neatly with skinflints who don't want to give ANYONE, ANYTHING..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0125.2
Feel free to quote one of us who said nobody wants to give anyone anything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0125.3
I have a feeling we'll be waiting for your reply for quite a while.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0125.4
He's just a kid, there's no point in trying to reason with him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0125.5
There is no reason children and teens can't understand such concepts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0125.6
They will never become adults until they are treated to the same standards.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0126.1
I dont see how it is government charity when the government FORCES the tax payer to give it up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0126.2
Of course you don't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0126.3
because it's not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.1
That is not self responsibility...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.2
That is telling victims.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.3
Fuck you
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.4
Sorry, but my country is not like that
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.5
No looking to the federal government to provide a solution is telling people "fuck you."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.6
If you really cared you would do more than just pay your taxes and look to your government for a solution every time disaster strikes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.7
I bet it's pretty easy to sit on your ass and point to the government..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.8
I would call that arrogant and snug...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.9
Paying taxes isn't good enough....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.10
Not to mention the majority of those assholes who sit there snug, who point to the government for solutions don't pay taxes anyways..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.11
Once again liberalism IS a mental disorder...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.12
Here is the way disaster relief works
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.13
If your house burns down, you are responsible for repairs along with whatever insurance and local charities wil pay
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.14
If there is a massive fire in your town, you still pay to fix your house, but the state will step in to provide additional assistance along with national charities
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.15
In a major disaster affecting a large region, the federal government steps in along with the state to provide disaster relief.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.16
National charities still provide individual assistance while the state and federal government provides grants and low cost loans to allow you to get back on your feet
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.17
So explain this...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.18
if my house is struck by lightening and burns down....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.19
Why am I not afforded the government grants and low cost loans?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.20
How does "widespread" affect anyone individually more than "one home affected"?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.21
You see...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.22
when you hgave government pick and choose, nothing is done fairly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0127.23
When the people pick and choose, everything is done fairly.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.1
So, you agree with Paul, that the government should have left it up to the localities to clean up their mess?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.2
if the government was not there to help them, I guarantee you, Americans would be there to help.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.3
We, as a collective of individual Americans donated more money to Haiti than all other countries combined.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.4
I am not referring to Government aid that was sent....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.5
individual donations from individual Americans collectively donted more than all other populations of all other countries combined.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.6
Our government didnt make us do it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.7
We did it becuase we wanted to.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.8
The problem with the left is they dont think Americans care about other people, so they feel Government needs to take our money and donate it for us.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.9
They are wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.10
I think that its more they don't care for other people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.11
So they dont expect others to do something they dont themselves do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.12
Instead they have calculated that if they look like they care about others, we will give them more power, and sadly we comply.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.13
Exactly, they want to look like they care, however when push comes to shove they start pointing fingers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.14
I suppose it's easy to talk but it's harder to act, and these twats are too fucking lazy and cheap to do a fucking thing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.15
As the old saying goes "talk is cheap."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0128.16
It's amazing how people don't see progressives for what they are...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.1
No I didn't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.2
I have been talking about disaster relief moving up from local to state to federal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.3
Each has it's own role.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.4
FDNY is city government and they were on site since the planes hit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.5
Federal Government did not have assets or personnel staged in New York and it took them longer to arrive
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.6
The Federal Government played a major role in the rebuilding of lower Manattan after 9-11.......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.7
we could not have relied on private charities
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.8
Actually, I questioned you as to why you feel it is OK for the federal government to offer individuals grants and low interest loans when in a wide spread disaster and not offer the same to individuals who suffer similar losses but not in a widespread event.,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.9
You never answered...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.10
you went inmto something about the need to clear roads, re build schools, etc.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.11
things I DIDNZT question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.12
But when it came to what I questioned?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.13
Nada.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.14
So answer my question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.15
A man who works in a city 30 miles away, loses his ho,e to a tornado that rips uyp the town he lives in. He still has a job becuase the city was unaffected...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.16
but he lost his home.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.17
Becuase it was widespread, he gets a low interest loan.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.18
In the meantime, a man who works from hoime loses his home to a fire caused by lightening.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.19
Now he not only lost his home, but he lost his place of business.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.20
But it was not widespread, so he does not get federal assiatnce.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.21
Why si that OK with you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.22
Why do you hate people that work in their own home?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.23
Personally.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.24
I agree with you and would have no problem with individual homeowners who suffer a catastrophic loss being eligible for low cost loans or tax write-offs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.25
I believe our right wing and Dr Paul would go ballistic though
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.26
As to why we differentiate...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.27
I did give you a potential rationale
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.29
Good question.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.30
It may be a question of magnitude once again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.31
If your house burns down, you still have your job.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.32
You still have a community structure around you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.33
What happens when your entire community is wiped out?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.34
Your job is gone, friends and neighbors who would have helped you before, now have their own problems.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.35
Is a bank going to help you when you don't even have a job anymore?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.36
Is a bank going to invest in a community that has been wiped out?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.37
The government will.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.38
Those loans not only help you rebuild your house but help your boss rebuild his business, help rebuild schools and bridges and roads
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.39
Personally, as a citizen, it makes me feel good to know that my government is there to help people in need.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.40
When I see US troops helping OUR people in a disaster area it makes me proud to be an American
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.41
In any case, when major disaster strikes, I am happy that the American people are there to help those in need
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.42
I love how you progressively can be pushed into conservative or even classical liberal ideas and then the next day you rest yourself like a watch and we do it again...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0178.43
It's almost like you're a closeted conservative...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0179.1
FDNY is local government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0179.2
You moved the goal posts from Fed to local.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0179.25
I don't believe most progressives even understand the difference between the state and federal government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0179.26
Most are too fucking stupid to hold a job - what makes anyone believe they could rationalize the constitution or even the Bill of Rights.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0179.27
Progressives are like gigantic babies...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0179.28
"ma, ma" "government, government"
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0201.1
So one thread wasnt enough?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0201.2
rdean has to make another one to blatantly lie?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0201.3
Im hardly going to be accused of being a Paul fan, but he's right that the Federal Government has no authority to be involved in disaster aid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0201.4
Apparently, rdean thinks that because he wont help them personally, no one else will.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0201.5
Beautiful to see States stand up against the intrusion of the Federal Government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0201.6
Speaking about the governor of Ohio turning down funds to help people who have lost everything, even family members.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0201.7
Gee, who said that you swine.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0201.8
It is beautiful to see States stand up to the intrusion of the Federal government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0201.9
It's not my fault you lack the integrity to acknowledge that there are other ways of providing aid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0201.10
Nor my fault that you dont want to see real charity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0202.11
rdean, he said FEDERAL aid, not help in any form.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0203.8
When you get to know rdean more, you will realize he doesn't really care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0204.11
Avatar, the fact is there is no intrusion, it was stated that Federal involvement would complicate matters at this point.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0205.2
It always does.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0206.1
Read your link and watched the video..
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0206.2
at no point does Ron Paul say Tornado Victims Should Fend For Themselves (let them die at work?)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0206.3
Another rdean lie.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0206.4
its a Dean thread.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0206.5
he titles the thread totally different than what the story says.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0206.6
he has a half a dozen of them out now.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0206.7
Dean would be a great News Reporter.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0206.8
they do the same thing....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0206.9
spin the story.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0207.4
You can't be serious.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0207.5
No relief for disaster victims is one of Paul's most popular spiels.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0207.6
Go to Youtube and do a search on "Ron Paul against FEMA".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0207.7
You can watch him rail against disaster relief till your heart's content.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0207.8
How is it possible for you guys to have so little knowledge about your presidential candidates?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0207.9
You seriously scare me.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0207.10
Dean he admits in the story he bad mouths FEMA......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0207.11
so what else you got?....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0208.10
Media of persuasions act in a similar manner.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0209.10
Yeah, FEMA's Katrina effort was an epic performance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0209.11
Upgrade that unit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0209.13
FEMA under Bush was in itself a disaster.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0209.14
We all know that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0209.15
FACT is that FEMA and Homeland Security under Obama works very well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0209.16
LOOK IT UP.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.1
Each state cannot prepare for a mega disaster.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.2
Having the Federal Government prepared to bring disaster relief where it is needed is more cost effective than 50 states preparing for a disaster that may never come
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.3
Look at the massive fires in Arizona and California last years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.4
Those states cannot afford to keep the manpower and equipment on hand to battle thousands of square miles of fire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.5
The Federal Government is able to bring in personnel and resources from around the country
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.6
Why exactly can't each state be prepared for a mega disaster?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.7
look at hurricane katrina.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.8
do you think LA alone could have prepared for that?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.9
lousiana only has 4.5 million people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.10
Hurricane katrina cost approx $110B in damage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.11
that means each resident would be responsible for approx $25k worth of the damage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.12
that is unrealistic
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.13
Loisiana is one of our poorest states.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.14
They also get much more federal aid than they pay in taxes If they were expected to be responsible for all the disaster cleanup they would have gone bankrupt.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.15
As it is......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0225.16
ALL Americans helped them in their time of need and that is the way it should be
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0226.14
That isn't how it works, dingleberry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0226.15
You brought up how well they work under your supreme leader.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0226.16
Now let's see some insttances where that is true.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0226.17
I'll wait.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0227.1
And that's because the State governments have ceded too much power to the Feds.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0227.2
If we fixed that problem, the States would have significantly more resources and be able to help themselves.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0227.3
That and they think there is "free" money available, of course they are going to ask.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0227.4
I think they would be better off without the Feds.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0227.11
This is part and parcel with you guys.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0227.12
You are looking to break up the United States.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0227.13
Ain't happening any time soon.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0228.12
Hurricane Irene.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0228.13

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0229.1
But Ron Paul wants taxpayers to pay for his airplane trips and then he bills his supporters too....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0230.2
Umm...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0230.3
no.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0231.1
lulz.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0231.2
Having been in direct aid to VT, and Ny myself, the only reason FEMA was even remotely effective is because of class A ground work by the states.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0231.3
Oh, and the fact they didn't have to actually consult with states they just moved right in thanks to congress giving them broadened authority.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0231.4
Without local know how, they would have botched the deal just as bad as Katrina.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0231.5
Hence, they are not really worth having adn should dismantled to the state level.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0231.6
We have national guard for when the statre requires tactical help such as Irene.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0231.7
if that's all FEMA has going for it, it isn't much at all.

My heart goes out to the people in tornado alley and I have no problem with my tax dollars going to help the survivors rebuild their lives.

Classic Ron Paul.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0232.5
At least in Ron Paul's world the tornado victims will have legalized drugs and prostitiution to comfort them.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0281.2
In 1893, when a massive drought afflicted Texas farmers, Cleveland categorically refused to grant federal aid to the victims.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0281.3
He issued an eloquent written justification for his decision: · Cleveland’s words skillfully represent the contrast between the effects brought about by the voluntary generosity of private parties and those created through the exercise of the coercive powers of government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0281.4
Private individuals, when not hindered by government intervention, have a choice in how to allocate their funds among the various purposes that they deem to be of importance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0281.5
Sorry....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0281.6
but your argument is a FAIL
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0281.7
Grover Cleveland was acting as chief executive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0281.8
The fact that he told flood victims to fuck themselves has no Constitutional bearing
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0281.9
It was a drought, not a flood, and if there was no constitutional authority then, there is no Constitutional authority NOW.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0281.10
I am afraid there is Constitutional authority to help Americans in times of need.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0281.11
Again, the General Welfare clause allows Congrees to do what they determine is in the best interests of the General Welfare of the people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0281.12
It has been used for a hundred years and upheld by the courts

Libertarians who only look out for themselves may not like it....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0281.14
but it is the law of the land
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0281.15
FEMA is an authorized federal agency.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0281.16
If you disagree with it's Constitutionality, you are welcome to challenge it in court
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0282.1
What is the policy on federal disaster aid for tornado damage?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0282.2
Insurance should cover most losses.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0282.3
Are we going to cover multi-car fog accidents?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0282.4

I don't see how ron paul is wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0283.2
Americans have big hearts, and can donate on their own accord.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0283.3
Also, the state governments have natural disaster plans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0283.4
Some of you just love the nanny government...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0283.5
The question is why.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0283.6
Bitching about FEMA during Katrina, then getting on here and posting about how great federal aid is, doesn't make perfect sense to you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0283.7
Why not?!?!?!??!?!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0283.8
because FEMA would have done quite well with Katrina....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0283.9
but Bush was a racist.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0283.10
and he wanted to control the balck population...

If an ice storm takes down power in a state/city for awhile, causes massive wrecks, etc then many times Governors ask for Federal help.

A town being leveled is a wee bit more serious than you losing your car in a fog wreck.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0294.5
You can have 50 cars damaged in a wreck and it still doesn't equal the damage of people losing their town/homes/businesses/lives from a tornado going for miles.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882466_0294.6

I can tell everyone that many years ago contraception was an issue for our family.

So the church is disabllowing its members from using birth control, the punishment for doing so will be the loss of entry into heaven.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0031.4
How is that different than forcing a behavior?

The Catholic are against contraceptives because they want as many members as they can get.

The church does prohibit birth control, does it not?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0052.12
Is the use of BC something one must confess to return to a state of grace?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0052.13
If this is true, one must conclude (if they are honest) that such is a form of power and control over the freedom of the individual, for without grace entry to heaven is problematic.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0053.1
As said by many, if you can't afford a dollar for a condom, you have two choices.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0053.2
1) keep it in your pants or 2) keep your legs closed...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0053.3
Depending on you sex.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0053.4
To force a church to go against its beliefs just so some poor fool can have sex without danger of getting a girl pregnant makes so little sense I can't believe people here are even defending it.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0053.10
maybe churchs shouldnt operate hospitals then.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0053.11
if they have a problem with performing or providing certain services that are part of that business model, then maybe they shouldnt be in that business to begin with.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0053.12
why would an intelligent person get involved in a business in which parts of it could violate their beliefs?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0053.13
that would be like a devout muslim opening a liquor store but refusing to sell booze.

Wry's point is....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0054.4
that not suggesting or providing contraceptives in countries like this, only exacerbates the problem that they are trying to fix.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0054.5
Why would you support giving birth to more babies into such desperate squalor.

The church is not the one who decides who goes to heaven or hell.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0055.14
The church's doctrine does not permit birth control but it does not use any force to get the congregation to comply.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0055.15

Please please help me understand that equation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.1
the GOP has an agenda.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.2
They wholeheartedly disagree with the idea that Goveernment can dictate via law what an enterpsie can and can not sell.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.3
If the product or service is legal, they should be allowed to sell it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.4
If they choose NOT to sell it, that should be THEIR choice.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.5
That is the crux oif the debate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.6
It happens to be contraception right now...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.7
but all along the agenda is the same.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.8
government has no right to tell ANYONE that they HAVE to SELL anything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.9
i think the crux of the debate is people understanding that contraception (as provided by health care providers) will not "free."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.10
it will be included in the cost of your original premium.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.11
thus they can not charge an extra co pay or fee for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.12
there are other services this applies to as well, such as mammograms.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.13
now...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.14
should all men who pay premiums demand that women pay for their own mammograms since 99% of men do not get them?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.15
the way health (and really all) insurance works is that you pay a premium for access to services.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.16
when you pay your premium and do not receive any services, you area subsidizing someone else's services.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.17
so every month i pay premiums, i help to pay for some guys viagra, or some womans pap smear, or some kids physical.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.18
should i be raising hell that they should be paying for those services themselves?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.19
but your insurance contract will not allow for that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.20
call your insurance company and demand that none of your premium dollars be used for any services or treatment you disagree with and see what happens.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.21
Take a pill so you can fuck your brains out is not the same thing as getting a mammogram to see if you have cancer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.22
Don't be fucking retarded.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.23
The crux of the debate is that the State went into a Church and directed them to do something against their faith.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.24
You get all hot and bothered when that same State invades your bedroom.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.25
It is very revealing of your two-facedness you don't mind it invading a Church.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.26
although you can take that same pill to control acne and hormone levels as well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0079.27
not all women use the pill as a pregnancy prevention device.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.1
It's real simple: Get the hell out of everybody's bedroom and start worrying about the economy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.2
This contraception thing is nothing but a new shiny object to distract the easily distracted and unfocused Republicans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.23
All you say is true....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.24
but you need to remember...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.25
it is insurance...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.26
so whereas someone else uses viagara, and you dont, you have the policy just in case ytou DO need viagara.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.27
It is like flood insurance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.28
I have it, but never used it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.29
My premium is paying for the poor guy that had to make a claim.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.30
I am OK with that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.31
If I werent, I have the right to call another insurance company and try to get a better rate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.32
But again...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.33
the real topic is the mandate...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.34
"ALL INSURANCE COMPANIES MUST OFFER THE SERVICE"...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.35
It is government intrusion into an iundustry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.36
I understand why government says you cant sell somethiong for it has been found to be dangerous...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.37
But to FORCE SOMEONE TO SELL SOMETHING?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.38
It is not OK in my book.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.39
And by the way...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.40
my wife and I enjoy sex....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.41
but we are done with having kids...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.42
so yes, we use contracption...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.43
in many varieties......
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.44
I am not against contraception...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.45
I am against government mandating one must offer it....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0080.46
even if it goes against their personal morals.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0081.20

That is the kind of logic you are using, and the kind of logic Ms. Fluke used.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0081.26

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0083.16
It's their choice as to what services they will provide and what they won't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0083.17
At least it is in a free society.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0084.17

I hate to break it to you, but grade school boys tall enough to reach the rubber machine on the truck stop bathroom wall can get contraception for next to nothing.

Or you can go to planned parenthood where it's passed out like candy.

You don't need insurance to get contraception.

its a double edged sword.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0095.11
as cruel as it sound, i would argue freedom of choice wins out on this fact and this alone.

the US is a secular society and not everyone believe in or follow religion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0095.13
now people are still free to choose which religion to follow, but (in this case) ruling in favor or religion would in effect make those of us who do not adhere to that religion forced to follow part of its doctrine.

It started as freedom of religion when the Catholic Church complained.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0101.28
Obama agreed and compromised.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0101.29
However, the compromise meant that insurance companies can be told by government that they MUST offer something, even if it goes against their morals.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0101.30
When has ANY business been told they MUST offer a service?

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0103.33

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0103.34

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0103.35
this is news to us all....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0103.36
you do realize that there is a difference between an insurance company and a health care provider right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.1
If this was truly about medical health, then it would be about condoms and not the pill.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.2
The women who need the pill for legitimate medical reasons are a tiny minority who would incur a very small cost to the healthcare system for their medication.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.3
To use these innocent women as human shields is vile, disgusting, shameless behavior.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.4
The rest of the women who want the pill would multiply the cost by a factor of ten.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.5
And so these women need to justify the expenditure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.6
They have not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.7
For these women, the pill serves no preventative medical purpose whatsoever.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.8
In fact, a condom is far safer as it actually prevents the spread of disease.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.9
But they did not ask for condoms.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.10
And that is why they cannot hide the fact this is about subsidizing their sex life, which is a totally bogus argument for a handout.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.11
So that is the end of that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.12
For the pro-life camp, they don't get off so easy from me, either.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.13
For decades, pro-lifers have been bitching about Planned Parenthood.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.14
Planned Parenthood gets federal funds to hand out birth control.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.15
Most people, including pro-lifers, are NOT morally opposed to birth control.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.16
However, money is fungible and so when you give cash to PP for birth control, that frees up other monies which can be spent performing abortions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.17
While Congress is technically not funding abortions, it actually is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.18
For the life of me, I do not know why after all these years it has not occured to the pro-life movement to open their own women's clinics which can then be used to provide adoption services, pre-natal care, and birth control.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.19
And if Congress is going to be spending money on birth control regardless of whether or not you think they should, then these clinics should get that birth control money, too.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.20
And there will not be any stain on that money abetting abortions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0106.21
This is America, and we thrive on free enterprise and competition.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0107.27
Some institutions are self insured because they make enough profit to cover the liabilities.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0160.7
i find it much more interesting that the religious right pushes for abortion to become illegal, because life is sacred, while at the same time opposing universal health care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0160.8
its extremely hypocritical to say life is sacred when your willing to fight to protect an unborn life, but not willing to fight to protect people who have already been born.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0160.10
Actually, It is how this Universal Health care is implemented.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0160.11
The method this adminstration is using is more of a corporatists venture in which the citizen is forced to buy insurance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0160.12
The preferred method for a universal health care is more of a socialistic venture in which everyone contributes to a fund to pay for the health care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0160.13
Both methods have draw backs, the corporatist approach still institutes the insurance companies which will seek to turn a profit by short changing the policy--also, by forcing demand, the insurance companies can raise their rates to ensure more profit for their companies.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0160.14
There is little reason not to do this since the competitive spirit of the free market is being challenged by the lack of choice including not buying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0160.15
The socialistic approach is still faced with rising costs in comparison to standard of living and the inefficiency of government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0160.16

Perhaps the solution to this biological problem, that has become political, is for the Church and Republican party to finance some type of creation or solution that when added to our drinking water removed the sex drive.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0183.2
I remember in the Fifties conservatives did not want flouride added to the water because flouride turned people into communists.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0183.3
If they can create a flouride that makes people communists surely they can come up with some kind of drug that destroys the sex thing.

For example, it's okay for you to impose your value, because you are special?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0185.2
In your own mind, maybe, outside of it, the word may take on a different meaning.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0185.3
Neither government nor people should impose their values on anyone.

But when they are of a moral or religious nature it's not government's business.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0185.8
If you want to change society's morals you appeal to the hearts and minds of the people that are willing to listen and if they embrace it what you find to be immoral will eventually die out on it's own.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0185.9
Government forcing a moral or religious principle creates rebellion and in the end delays or prevents it being embraced by society.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0185.10
History is pretty clear on this one.

You might want to consider the distinction between Principle, and Dogma.

Legal codes enforce matters properly defined in philosophy as ethical or moral.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0205.2
"Thou shall not steal" is a moral imperative (or a Commandment from God) and codified in the Penal Code of all states.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0205.3
Government does enforce morality.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0205.4
Laws against theft and murder were around a long time before Moses wrote them on a rock.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0205.5
Did we forget that Moses was forced to flee Egypt for murdering someone?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0205.6
Theft is illegal not because it's necessarily immoral but because it infringes on the rights of others.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0205.7
Of course there were prohibitions against theft and murder before Moses, that was expressed in my post (Moral Imperative).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0205.8
Can you clarify your remark, specifically, "theft is illegal not because it's necessarily immoral" with an example of when theft is moral or amoral?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0205.9
moral theft...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0205.10
stealing the car keys off a drunk driver.

As to the food and water issue, The Catholic Church alone, has done more to get more food and water to starving people then you have or ever will.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0206.25
Its there right to provide there employees what the will.

The point I made regarding food and clean water, as well as disease, was focused specifically on current events in Africa.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0206.27
Not only is the Catholic Church opposed to contraception but the Bush Adminsitrtion was opposed to any efforts to protect pregnanat women (and their unborn children) from disease - water born & AIDS - and poor prenatal nutrition.

I have no doubt the Catholic Church engages in good works and I have no problem with their moral objection to abortion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0206.29
What I object to, strongly, is stupidity.

How is preventing a child's conception a moral issue and how is it any business of the church.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0206.31

By the way, how is a preventing pregnancy not a moral issue?

The Catholic church should concern themselves with trying to keep their house in order.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0214.2
The pervert priests throughout the existence of the church should be of greater concern than what people think about contraception.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0214.3
Fortunately the Catholic Church has been losing its power, and because of the pervert priest scandals, its money for some time now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0214.4
They are nothing more than hypocrites in a big way.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0215.1
Contraception is about responsible parenthood.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0215.2
Why would Republicans choose to make it an issue in an election year is beyond me.

For some reason, anything having to do with sex puts them in a tizzy
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0215.4
Republicans did not, and are not, making contraception an issue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0215.5
Ummmmm....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0215.6
it seems they are
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0215.7
Cracked that door a little bit and social conservatives came running through
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0216.5
Republicans are against women's health because they don't believe government should provide them with free contraception with money confiscated by government guns.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0216.6
You don't think that's making contraception an issue?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0216.7
Seriously?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0216.8
All that for a little pill?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0235.5
That would certainly be a good example.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0235.6
But more to the point that there are laws which certainly coincide with a "moral code" such as laws against murder or theft but the real sticking point is that those acts violate the rights of others.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0235.7
People often make the argument that our laws are based on the ten commandments or are based on Judeo-Christian theology and that's not quite the case.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0235.8
Only two (arguably three or four) of the commandments are enforced by law in the United States and those that are existed in most societies long before Judaism even entered the picture.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0235.9
Other laws based on a moral belief (such as the Massachusetts "crimes against chastity laws") have been declared to be unconstitutional.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0235.10
So what I am getting at is that government only enforces "morality" when it happens to coincidentally do so in the act of protecting the personal rights of other people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0235.11
I am sure there are exceptions that can be found and certainly there are still "moral laws" on the books, but for the most part they are rarely enforced or they get shot down when brought before the SCOTUS unless they have some secondary purpose that overrides the moral purpose.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0235.12
Most crimes in the Penal Code - and other codes - have victims, and are therefore protecting the rights of others.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0235.13
There are exceptions however, being under the influence of a drug or narcotic is one, a women exposing her breast in public is another.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0235.14
Aren't these examples of the government enforcing a moral code?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0236.1
Socialists/Progressives like to have it both ways on issues like this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0236.2
They don't really want the Government out of the bedroom.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0236.3
They only want that when it's convenient for them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0236.4
They fully support the Government forcing Taxpayers to subsidize fellow Citizens' personal sexual behavior.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0236.5
They also fully support forcing Taxpayers to subsidize Abortions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0236.6
So they're not very honest or consistent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0236.7
It's time for Big Government to really get out of the bedroom.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0236.8
Let the age of personal responsibility dawn.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0236.9
No, they dont, because they know its illegal to use taxpayers funds to subsidize abortion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0236.10
So liberals dont want to have it both ways, theyre being perfectly honest and consistent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0236.11
If conservatives really want Big Government out of the bedroom and an age of personal responsibility to dawn, then they need to cease their efforts to violate a womans right to privacy with regard to abortion and access to contraceptives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0236.12

Unless of course one is dealing with conservatives who oppose abortion for women in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother; in addition to being ignorant hypocrites, such conservatives are also criminals.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0236.15
Juxtaposing abortions and bedrooms is a little strange, don't you think?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0236.16
Especially on top of the false claim that women are being denied access to contraceptives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0237.1
Sex is optional.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0237.2
You can either choose to have sex or knot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0237.3
If you choose to have sex you should act like a good girl and not a whore.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0237.4

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0237.5

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0256.23
and you raising issues with your health care provider already?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0256.24
making sure that none of your premiums dollars are going towards services you disagree with?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0257.17
Not a Government issue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0257.18
The Government should not force anyone to pay for someone else's personal sexual behavior.

Have all the Contraception & Abortions you want, but pay for it yourself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0257.20
The Government shouldn't be involved with these issues.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0258.15
since the government is not providing services, your argument is invalid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0258.16
and im glad to see you skipped over the rest of my argument on how insurance works in general.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0258.17
so i assume you are ok with paying your premiums to your health insurance company knowing that they provide abortions?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0259.11
Some things i just can't control.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0259.12
I don't like Abortion but if Health Insurance covers it, than so be it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0259.13
But the Government shouldn't be involved with issues like this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0259.14
Contraception and Abortion are private personal matters.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0260.12
again since they are not providing it, i dont see how it is your concern.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0260.13
would you as upset if they mandated that mammograms be provided at no extra charge?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0260.14
because thats part of the ACA as well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.1
man you need to go back and get an education of at least the high school level.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.2
so lets use your car insurance analogy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.3
so you have car insurance (mandated by the government none the less).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.4
and you get in an accident and cause damage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.5
we'll even take your liability case as an example.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.6
the damage you cause is $75,000.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.7
now youve only had insurance for 1 years at a rate of $50 per month.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.8
so you in essence have paid $600 into the insurance pool.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.9
now where does the other $74,400 come from?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.10
Other peoples premiums!!!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.11
holy shit, so other people are actually paying for your mistakes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.12
you are correct in one thing, and that is insurance helps spread the risk.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.13
now if you have full coverage insurance and you get hurt, then your insurance company will pay out to yourself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.14
same example, if you have had insurance for 1 year and have been paying $50 a month ($600 a year) and get in an accident that is your fault and your medical bills are $200,000.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.15
where does that other $199,400 come from?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.16
ohhh thats right other people premiums!!!!!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.17
amazing, you dont understand how this works.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.18
How does that disprove my assertion that buying insurance is paying another person to assume the risk?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.19
but you are wrong in the way it works behind the scenes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.20
i never said it was a fee based services.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.21
i said you pay a fee for "access" to medical services.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.22
that fee is called a premium.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.23
you fail to understand that somewhere somehow the actual cost for your services is paid for by the pool of money the company bring in through premiums.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.24
if an insurance company is paying out more in services than they are getting in premiums they current do 2 things.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.25
they drop those who cost too much to insure, or they raise rates to cover those services.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.26
regardless, the money that actually pays doctors is from the pool of premiums that everyone pays.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.27
hence you pay other peoples services every day of the week.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.28
whether you want to admit it or not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.29
but the again the right isnt big on facts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.30
Again, a premium is not so you have access to service, your premium is paid to another person so they assume the risk.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.31
How the person, or company, deals with that risk is irrelevant, you are not paying them so you can access services.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.32
Hence, no one pays anyone for anyone else's services ever.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0261.33
This is the last time I am going to explain this, so feel free to blather your ignorance in assurance that I will not again explain why the sky is blue.

Everyone remember the sky is orange because Syohon says it is.

Time to get the Government out of the bedroom.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.3
No more having it both ways.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.4
The Government doesn't belong being involved with such private personal matters.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.5
And they definitely shouldn't be forcing anyone to pay for someone else's Contraception & Abortions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.6
Taxpayers are not required to fund fellow Citizens' personal sexual behavior.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.7
It's the individual Citizens' responsibility to fund their own behavior.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.8
You want to be promiscuous and have several Abortions?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.9
Well then you have to take personal responsibility and fund that behavior yourself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.10
It's not your fellow Citizens' responsibility to do that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.11
Big Government needs to be booted out of these personal social issues.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.12
They're clearly over-reaching now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.13
I find this issue rather interesting myself.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.14
The left yells and holler that they demand government to stay out of the bedroom and "private affairs" with respect to Defense Of Marriage Act and same sex marriage, yet they really don't want government out of the bedroom because the left is now trying everything to connect contraception with the notion that it's somehow a HEALTH issue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.15
It's not a health issue in the respect that mamograms are, it's just another "give me, give me" entitlement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.16
What exactly entitles government to give you free contraception, to in effect have taxpayers PAY for your extracurricular activities?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.17
Health insurance should be treated with various cover options with everyone that seeks to have health care coverage paying for BASIC services.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.18
If you want the cadillac option that includes free contraception, free viagra, free gym membership and weight loss programs, etc. then that individual must pay for the added individual premium coverage for those desired programs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.19
Government should stay out of issues such as these, period.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.20
It's not the Federal Government's job to be and act as the "responsible" parent, because some complaining entitlement supporters choose not to be.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.21
Contraception is about family planning, not about wild sex.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.22
You can have wild sex without contraception.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.23
It is in the interest of the society that unwanted children be kept to a minimum.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.24
It reduces the abortion rate, the number of children born to single mothers and the burden on society
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.25
As such, government has the right to require insurance companies, which make a tremendous amount of money off of our society to include contraceptive coverage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.26
We tried to implement a government insurance option and insurance companies spent billions to block it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.27
This is part of their payback
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0270.28

Why not just make all contraception free?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0271.29
Maybe do Contraception Bouquets at FTD or Pro Flowers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0271.30
Totally free of course.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0271.31
Contraception is a Right, correct?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0271.32
How many Soldiers have died protecting your Right to stick it where you want without having to take any responsibility?

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0276.25
Most contraception is used by married couples who are trying to responsibly control the number of children they have.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0276.27

what is the moral opposition to birth control?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0277.6
Insurance will pay for those because it's cheaper than the costs associated with a baby.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0277.7
It's an economic decision for the insurance company not a moral one
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0278.5
Agreed
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0278.7
Complete bullshit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0278.8
It's in an insurance company's best financial interests to do so hence the reason why most of them do, BUT the government has no right to require that of anyone whether it's a religious organization (such as one run by the Catholic Church) with a moral purpose for not providing it or a secular company with a bad grasp of economics.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0282.28

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0283.1
At the same time the government should not be forcing people to pay for other's people's contraception or forcing insurance companies to offer coverage for contraception if they choose not too
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0283.2
you pay for other peoples health care every time you pay your insurance premiums....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0283.3
are you protesting your current insurance company as right now?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0284.8

the government didnt say you directly pay for other peoples health care idiot.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0294.6
the law says the health care providers can not change an extra co-pay or co-insurance for contraception.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0294.7
its not free, its simply included in the cost of your premium.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0294.8

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.3
I don't have to have insurance, its still a choice.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.4
How an insurance company uses the money from the premiums to pay for other people's health care is their business.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.5
If they want to charge extra for contraception coverage that is also also their business not the government's you arrogant prick.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.6
you have no idea what this conversation is even about.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.7
point to where the government says you will pay for other peoples contraception?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.8
the argument stems from a portion of the law that states all insurance plans must provide contraception as a services.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.9
and that service will be provided for no extra charge.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.10
meaning no extra copay or coinsurance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.11
do you have any idea how insurance actually works already?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.12

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.13

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.15

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.16
Apparently so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.17
How insurance works?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.18
Education?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.19

Get over your superiority complex dickhead
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.21
if you dont understand a simple premise like how insurance works obviously cant understand the rest of the argument.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.22
so what you are really advocating is that insurance companies and health care providers not be regulated to have uniform standards?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.23
hmmm like all those ethical insurance companies who used to drop people when they got sick, or refused to provide them certain services they thought were too expensive, or refused to provide coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.24
hmmm sounds like a wonderfully perfect system.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.25
pretty soon they wont have any regulations, and then they wont have to provide services to anyone who cant pay full price for the services.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0307.26
so no one will have access to coverage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0308.5
Again,
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0308.17

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0309.21
He has trouble with complex chains of thought.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.1
First off, the fact that health care costs so much and that so many people have to have insurance, (which was originally created to be only for catastrophic situations) just to walk into a doctor's office is because the government's overinvolvement in health care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.2
But that's for a whole other discussion
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.3
Government has restricted market forces from weeding out insurance companies who act out as you stated by preventing people from purchasing insurance across state lines.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.4
This created an artificial monopoly where costs go up and coverage grows poorer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.5
Open up access and competition increases.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.6
Increased competition means lower cost and better coverage for everyone.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.7
Should people have recourse if the insurance company screws the person over by not providing an agreed upon paid for service?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.8
Yes!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.9
In a free market these companies will go out of business real fast.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.10
Should the government mandate what services an insurance company provides?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.11
No.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.12
Government is not the solution, its the problem.

But that's just my opinion as is yours that the government is the solution.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.14
OK, we disagree.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.15
i think when the free market fails to provide an adequate service such a basic health care at an affordable price government intervention can force change.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.16
since the majority of people on this thread have basically decided that access to affordable health care is not a basic right and people do not deserve it, this rules out universal health (unlike most of the rest of the industrialized world).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.17
this being said, government regulation of this can provide a framework to make it accessible by more people than it currently it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.18
government is not always the solution, but neither is the free market.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.19
just use the financial markets betwen 2004 and 2008 as an example of this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.20
If the insurance industry operated in a regulated free market there would be little or any threat of the horrors of dropped coverage,etc because the market would weed out bad actors.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.21
Not only that, prices would fall as insurance companies would lose their protected markets.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.22
People would have more choice.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.23
They could shop for the kind of coverage they wish to buy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.24
And if you or anyone else thinks Obamacare's mandate that pre existing conditions must be covered is going to work, your nuts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.25
Private insurers will simply stop writing health coverage and will of course drop existing insureds when their policies expire.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.26
Of course this is the goal of Obamacare.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.27
To create a system where the only insurer available if the federal government.

Obama gets his wish for socialized medicine.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.29
And we get shitty rationed care by doctors who are from third world countries, can barely speak English and are more likely to screw up.

they did operate in a free market between 1990 and 2008.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0319.31
how did the free market work out during that time?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0320.18
If they operated in a free market why were they required to cover so many different things under penalty of law?

I think that birth control should remain legal as even if it is wrong, · the person has the right to chose to do it any way.

I am not for it or against, I am not a woman though.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0321.10
I do believe that abortion is a sin as I see it as murder, which is why I am lead to believe that birth control should not be thought of as wrong as it could save a person from committing a sin by having to have an abortion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0321.11
Where if they had been taking birth control they never would have had to commit a sin.

Everybody who has insurance pays for other people's claims.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.11
The purpose of insurance is to spread the risk around.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.12
Some people will never have a claim.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.13
Others will have many claims.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.14
Do you own a home?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.15
Think about how much your homeowner's insurance costs you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.16
I had a patient in his 80s a couple weeks ago who has owned a home for 50 years.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.17
He said he figured up that over his lifetime he has paid $50,000 in premiums, but has never filed a claim.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.18
I haven't figured up mine because I've moved several times.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.19
Too much trouble.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.20
But mine right now is pretty high.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.21
I've only filed one claim and that was for a roof damaged by hail.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.22
$5,000.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.23
I've paid in much more.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.24
But the others who have lost everything have been covered because I have joined in and help, with my premiums, to spread the risk around.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.25
That's how all insurance works.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.26
Med mal, health, car, you name it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.27
The name of the game is spreading out the risk.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.28
If you never have a claim, you pay for everyone else's!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.29
If I were an insurance company, I would pay for contraception.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.30
It would mean fewer dependents to cover.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.31
Not true.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.32
If you have insurance you are paying a third party to assume the risk for your claims.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.33
Most insurance companies use the money from premiums to pay claims, but that does not mean that the person paying the premium is actually paying the claim.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0333.34
There are insurance pools set up where people do pay for other people's claims, but they do that by sending payment directly to the person that needs the money, not to the doctor or hospital.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0334.31 ::script amr-snt-id-rep
Well, if you were a a private insurance company you should have the choice to offer contraception coverage or not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0334.32
Not be required to do so or not by the government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0334.33
As far as premiums paying for other people's claims, is it really relevant?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0334.34
I still have the choice to pay for insurance or not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0334.35
Another issue is the federal government is not even authorized to provide health care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0334.36
If we want to do this the constitution must be amended (not that the Federal government even follows the constitution anyway) However, if the people of the individual states want to have their state government run their health care that's completely fine.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0334.37
Just don't expect the people of the other states that don't want it to pay for it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.1
The commerce clause, the 10th amendment, and universal health care would be a court battle that's for sure.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.2
As for your comment
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.3
You are trying to make people who don't support government run health care appear to lack compassion.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.4
We already have a qausi socialized system.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.5
There is already enough regulation to allow for recourse for declining paid for coverage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.6
I am of the opinion that free market forces will allow for greater ingenuity in medicine and lower costs through competition.

Artificial monopolies don't work and they stagnate progress.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.8
More government involvement will generate more problems.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.9
We simply disagree on what the government's role should be in health care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.10
In turn, what's wrong with letting an individual state such as New York have government run care while New Hampshire does not?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.11
With the residents of New Hampshire not having to pay for New Yorkers' health care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.12
my post is not advocating for a full government run system.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.13
what i am simply pointing out that government regulation can provide an avenue for change.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.14
which is what is happening here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.15
there are many good things in the health care law which everyone agrees are good.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.16
things like making 80% of premium dollars be used on patient care, not being able to drop patients when they get sick, the removal of lifetime caps, kids being able to stay on their parents insurance until 26, mammograms at no additional costs, the elimination of pre-exisiting conditions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.17
without government intervention then none of this would have happened.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.18
the free market is not always the best solution.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.19
look at natural monopolies such as utilities providers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.20
they have government regulated monopolies because it makes more sense logisitically and financially to have one say electricity provider instead of 20 in a given area.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.21
look at what the free market did to the financial markets between 2004 and 2008?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.22

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.23

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.24
but.....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.25
government intervention and regulation can provide a positive avenue for change when the free market is not willing to do so.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.26
health care costs have increased 10 fold since 1990, and the average family is getting squeezed out of the insurance market.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.27
all of this due to the free market.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.28

your notion of letting NY have state run health care but no NH opens a large amount of problems.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.32
what if someone from NY travels to NH and gets hurt, but NH will not accept the NY health insurance?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.33
so the patient has to be transported back to NY at the possibility of dying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.34
if every state had their own standards of health care, each state would need to have an separate agreement with every other state to accept that states health insurance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.35
if a state is not willing to do so, then you create problems amongst the states.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.36
you will have people who will not travel outside their state for fear of incurring costs associated with this.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.37
you will also have 50 different form of health care.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.38
what if NY had good health care, and NH didnt have good health care, would you allow the residents of NH to cross state lines and improve their health care?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.39
would NH be allow to restrict this through law?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.40
would people being to flee states due to lack of access to health care?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.41
if you create one single minimum standard that has met, you provide uniformity across the industry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882529_0344.42

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0050.37

I'll answer the question, those who choose to sit on their asses and not help themselves do not deserve the help of others.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0051.4
Those that at least try to find work and do better for themselves deserve our help to get them on their feet.

If you listen to his whole quote instead of just being a left wing prick here and I'm no Romney fan, Mitt was explaining how the poor had a safety net built in and the rich shouldn't worry but he was really concerned in this day and age the the middle class was losing everything they had gained slowly over all these decades.

But look at the other side.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0058.3
The poor in this country enjoy a lifestyle envied by even middle class people in most of the world.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0058.4
What have they done to deserve this?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0058.5
The idlest of the idle rich invest money and help other hard working people get ahead.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0058.6
The poor simply absorb tax payer funding and have babies.

Are you going to make A Modest Proposal on what to do with our poor?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0059.3

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0061.1

FWIW local churches and other benevolent orgs are far better equipped to deal with those situations than the gov't.

As to your rant, during most of Bush's tenure the UE rate was about 5%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0096.8
Meanwhile there was lots of off shoring going on.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0096.9
So off shoring does not cause job loss.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0096.10
Actually for every job exported three more are created domestically.

The Unemployment rate isn't that important.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0096.18
a 5% unemployment rate where everyone has McJobs isn't an improvement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0096.19
I would much rather have the Clinton UE of 3.9% where you could throw out a resume and get a better paying job in a month that you barely qualified for than the 6.3% UE of Bush where you couldn't get a job you totally qualified for because you were competing against 40 other guys who were just as qualifed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0096.20
Offshoring replaced good paying manufacturing jobs with service McJobs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0096.21
That was NOT an improvement, guy.

Your comparison of the Bush years with the Clinton years is a joke.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0096.28
But I have effectively refuted your point: off shoring was going like crazy during hte Bush years and there was more manufacturing going on here and less unemployment.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0096.29

You should ask all the Christian Churches who give millions to the poor in one form or another.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0098.8
If the poor do not deserve such charity, then Christianity is a religion with a very serious fundamental flaw...

There have been times in the past, perhaps to this day, when some military families qualified for food stamps, and perhaps other government 'handouts'.

On the contrary my purpose in responding to this thread has been to point out that there is nothing shameful in having priorities other than making the maximum possible amount money and that simply having money does not mean you are more intelligent or industrious than anyone else.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0223.24
By the same token not having a great deal of money doesn't mean someone expects, wants or needs some kind of handout.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0223.25
And it most certainly does NOT follow that a lack money indicates a lazy welfare cheat and/or drug dealer.

The truth is that the govt is the least efficient method of distributing anything that might actually help people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0234.7

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0234.13

So you think an active duty member of the military whose family qualifies for food stamps should get a parttime job (is that even legal?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0237.2
!) so that he makes enough to not be qualified for food stamps?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0237.3
You see, this is why I'm right when I say conservatism is dead.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0237.4
The only active duty personnel I ever saw in 23yrs that needed food stamps were the ones that enlisted with a family all ready or got married too young and started a family.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0237.5
If a man or woman enlists at 18 and waits 3 or 4 years until they are at least E-4 or E-5 when they qualify for military housing, they can raise a family with no problem on military pay.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0237.6
That depends, an E-4 or an E-5 with a spouse and kids who lives on a base in California or Hawaii would probably qualify for food stamps because the cost of living is so outragreously high in those places, I was stationed at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara country and everyone who wasn't an E-7 or above was struggling like hell to make ends meet, the cash checking places were always packed with enlisted folks on the · 1st and 15th when we got paid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0237.7
If they live in on base housing, thier rent is covered.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0246.14
Most of their overhead is dedicated just to the act of raising money.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0247.13
I'll bet it is much higher than the AVERAGE (not some horror story) for charities.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0248.13
The issue is not which kind of 'charity' is most efficient, government or private.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0248.14
The issue is that government charity creates a class of poor who are never anything but poor, make their beds daily in their own misery, cannot see the opportunities that are out there for them in this great country, and have given up their freedom for a type of miserable security that no one would choose without having it foisted upon them.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0254.13 ::script amr-snt-id-rep
Hardly...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0254.14
the red tape and crap thru the multi-levels of government waste more money...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0254.15
you find NUMEROUS NUMEROUS charities out there where a vast majority, if not all proceeds going to the cause and not lining pockets
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0255.12
You get to research and choose your charities....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0255.13
while government adds more and more levels, more and more red tape, at more and more expense, WITHOUT choice
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.1
We need fewer people on welfare, not more.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.2
Well no shit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.3
Why don't you propose just how it is that these welfare recipients are going to get that working poor job.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.4
Where are the Repubcon "job creators".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.5
I mean, what could be better than employing a person with no skills and no education?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.6
You only have to pay them minimum wage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.7
Someoen with no skills isn't worth minimum wage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.8 ::script amr-snt-id-rep
That's why they're unemployed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.9
Reduce min wage and we can see some job growth.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.10
And as people develop skills from their starter job they will earn more.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.11
Now we can see why you are such a rocket scientist
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.12
Just what we need to help people escape poverty....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.13
slashing wages and benefits
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.14
So Rabbi...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.15
according to your economic model.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0280.16
If you are paying some guy minimum wage to sweep your floors, if you slash minimum wage you will now hire two guys to sweep your floors
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0281.8
Again.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.1
When you get that minimum wage job with no benes, how long are they going to keep it?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.2
When you can't pay for child care, how long are you going to work.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.3
If you get sick and fired for missing work, oh well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.4
From the discussions I read on here, people would think it is easy to be poor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.5
They have big screens, but they bought them from a person that sells stolen goods.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.6
They have a cell phone.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.7
Whoop t do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.8
How they gonna conduct their "bidness" without a cell phone?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.9
So they have medical issues.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.10
That is what 911 calls are for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.11
And hospital emergency rooms.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.12
Much easier to be rich.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.13
As long as you don't want to tax them more.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.14
Then it is really REALLY hard to defend your money.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.15
But it is much easier if you have poor people to blame for not paying taxes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.16
Then rich people can say that if poor people don't pay income taxes then why should they pay even more income taxes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.17
Doesn't make any difference if the fact poor people pay no income tax is the result of the tax writing policies put in place by the Repubcons so the stupid Dems would go along with the tax package that lowered the tax rates on the wealthy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.18
It is the poor persons fault.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.19
Poor people have really sucky lobbyists.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.20
Aww poor people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.21
It's just really tough.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.22
Much easier to sit back and get dat gummint check.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.23
Let's make it easy for everyone.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0282.24
Hey, let's just send everyone a gummint check every month and no one will have child care worries or problems paying rent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0283.17
You really have to wonder why he hasn't left in shame.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0284.12
I hope you mean Nutwinger.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0284.13
I guess it never occurred to him that if you expect people to work their way up you need to have somewhere they can start.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0284.14
With a high min wage it cuts out lots of starting jobs, like theater ushers and the like, that teenagers typically got back in the 50s, 60s etc. Now there is hardly any way a teenager can get job experience so they are more employable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0284.15
We raised the min wage and teenaged unemployment went through the roof.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0284.16
And the Dems want it even higher.

Many restaurant workers do not make minimum wage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0287.18
They depend on tips.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0288.13
If they need a theater usher they will hire one at minimum wage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0288.14
Fact is, they don't need them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0288.15
Jobs are determined by the work that needs to be accomplished.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0288.16
Cutting the minimum wage does not mean you have more work
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0289.11
Raising the minimum wage is why we no longer have theater ushers, or gas station attendants.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0289.12
We got self serve gas stations when the minimum wage made it cost effective.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0289.13
We used to have a LOT of entry level jobs for kids that the minimum wage got rid of.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0289.14
Remember the paper boy?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0290.14
We still have "Paper boys" they drive cars though.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.8
And how many of those types do you think there are?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.9
Let's see...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.10
ONCE AGAIN...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.11
we have a real unemployment number(including those that gave up) of 12-15%.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.12
So at the high end...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.13
that's 60 million people....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.14
let's break that down, shall we?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.15
How many are disabled?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.16
How many are just temporarily receiving benefits?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.17
How many are REALLY working the system?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.18
I dont know.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.19
ANd it doesnt matter.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.20
What matters is we have a very large number of people who think a gov't check is a reasonable alternative to finding work.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.21
And our system has fostered that belief.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0300.22
We need to reform the system (not just welfare) to make it possible fr people to enter the workforce and stay there and advance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0301.12
One needs that capacity to begin with.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0301.13
Sociopathic personalities don't.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0302.20
I happen to agree with Rabbi
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0302.21
Welfare needs to provide two things.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0302.22
A safety net and a path out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0302.23
While conservatives rant about how the safety net allows the poor to live in the lap of luxury with flat screen TVs, microwave ovens and cell phones, most poor live in bad neighborhoods with bad schools and few job prospects
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0302.24
As to a path out....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0302.25
that's where it gets tricky.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0302.26
We need to provide good schools, jobs related training, low cost childcare and jobs programs that not only provide a foot in the door but some type of career path
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0302.27
Most importantly, the poor need to do more to help themselves.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0302.28
Low marriage rates, fractured family structures, teenaged pregnancy all help to ensure they do not escape poverty
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0303.25
And poverty programs all support and reward exactly those things you correctly identify as keeping people in poverty.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882762_0303.26
Maybe htis is a breakthrough.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.1
The other day (March 1) Senator Olympia Snowe wrote a piece in the WaPo detailing why she's quiting.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.2
Sounds a lot like what Evan Bayh said a couple of years ago.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.3
Putting aside whatever you might think of either person, the issue of the Senate's total inability to cooperate with each other is badly damaging the country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.4
Quite frankly, I don't know if it'll make much difference who wins the WH or who wins the Senate majority this November.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.5
I don't see either party winning 60 seats, so it's going to come down to bipartisanship if anything significant is to be done.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.6
And we got some significant things that need doing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.7
I think Obama's partisan politics and rhetoric make him unable or maybe even unwilling to actually cooperate and compromise.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.8
If he's elected, I don't see him accepting anything less than his way on everything important.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.9
The same for Harry Reid, if a repub wins the WH but the Dems keep their majority in the Senate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.10
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe that's unfair, but these guys appear to be soley interested in party politics above what's really best for the country.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.11
And I can't say the GOP would be any different if they get in. Even if they did win the WH and both Houses of Congress, they're not going to have a filibuster proof Senate, and that means working together with the Dems.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.12
In my view, the Dems had their shot and blew it; it's time to give the repubs their chance, with the understanding that we need to see some action on the things that matter most.

snippet:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.14
One difficulty in making the Senate work the way it was intended is that America’s electorate is increasingly divided into red and blue states, with lawmakers representing just one color or the other.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.15
Before the 1994 election, 34 senators came from states that voted for a presidential nominee of the opposing party.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.16
That number has dropped to just 25 senators in 2012.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.17
The result is that there is no practical incentive for 75 percent of the senators to work across party lines.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.18
The great challenge is to create a system that gives our elected officials reasons to look past their differences and find common ground if their initial party positions fail to garner sufficient support.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.19
In a politically diverse nation, only by finding that common ground can we achieve results for the common good.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0001.20
That is not happening today and, frankly, I do not see it happening in the near future.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0002.12
Boehner and McConnell have equally engaged in partisan politics and rhetoric making both unwilling to actually cooperate and compromise; indeed, McConnell made clear the Senate Minoritys one goal was to get rid of Obama. To blame only Obama and Reid for playing politics is blind and partisan on your part.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0002.13
And I can't say the GOP would be any different if they get it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0002.14
Even if they did win the WH and both Houses of Congress, they're not going to have a filibuster proof Senate, and that means working together with the Dems.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0002.16
Give the GOP a chance to do what, exactly?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0002.17
They had their chance between 2001 and 2007, resulting in two failed, illegal wars, a deficit, and bigger government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0002.18
Some might go so far as to say GOP policies resulted in the December 2007 recession; I wont make that claim but its certainly damning evidence.

Compromise is a dirty word to most of the right who actually destroy their own for engaging in such treason to the ideology and you are going to complain that democrats refuse to cooperate?

Democrats have compromised on plenty, they are just not going to assist republicans in their mission to dump the poor and the old any further, republicans are going to have to finish that one by themselves.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.1
Well, you can't pass a Health Care Bill, in the middle of the night, against the majority of the nation, with little or no input of the other side and expect lines not to be draw-en.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.2
Horseshit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.3
On so many levels.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.4
One, the bill was "against the majority of the nation" only when you combine those who were against any comprehensive health care reform with those who thought the bill wasn't nearly liberal enough.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.5
Two, the only reason there was little or no input from the other side is because the other side refused to offer any beyond "kill the bill."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.6
Three, in spite of the fact that Democrats passed the bill by themselves, it is still from start to finish a Republican bill, lacking every feature that progressives might have preferred (e.g. a public option), and the only reason Republicans opposed it is because they would politically committed to oppose anything and everything.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.7
The Majority is the Majority no matter what.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.8
Even under President Clinton when the majority was against that health care bill, it was respected and not passed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.9
Because the majority did not want it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.10
It wasn't forced like this one was.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.11
You didn't watch the committee meetings did you?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.12
The majority of Dems killed almost every single bill brought up by Republicans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.13
So their bills did not even get to the floor for a vote at all.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.14
This Health Care Bill is a Democratic Bill all the way, through and through.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0022.15

But what we have is worse...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0023.2
What I'm saying is that there was no majority.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0023.3
A minority of the people wanted a more progressive approach to health-care reform.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0023.4
A minority liked the ACA as written.

A minority were philosophically opposed to any significant government involvement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0023.6
The only way you get a majority is to improperly and deceptively combine the third group with the first one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0023.7
That is, not to put it too strongly, bullshit.

The majority of Dems killed almost every single bill brought up by Republicans
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0023.10
I watched some of them, and read about the GOP proposed amendments afterwards.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0023.11
The Republicans knew their amendments would be killed, and intended that they be killed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0023.12
Those amendments existed only to slow the process down.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0023.13
None of them were serious attempts to improve the bill.

Funny how even a relatively sane and rational Republican like Wiseacre sees Obama as a hard-line, inflexible partisan, while to us on the left he comes across as a totally unsatisfactory limp noodle without a vertebra to his name.

Clearly, Snowe's reasoning doesn't apply to the president (regardless of party) since he is elected by all of the states.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0024.3
What would you call a President who deliberately called conservatives 'the enemy'?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0024.4
There is no clearer 'partisan' than your messiah.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8882774_0024.5
I don't have a "messiah," and if I did he certainly wouldn't be Obama, and I don't recall him calling conservatives "the enemy," and would appreciate a link or citation of him doing so.

Here's an interesting take on how turnout is shaping up in this primary season, by demographic, and what that implies for the GOP this year.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.2

In barely a centurys time, the population of the United States has more than tripled, to 313 million.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.4
We are a clattering, opinionated cluster of nearly all the worlds races and religions, and many of its languages, under one flag.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.5
You would not know any of this looking at who is voting in one of the strangest presidential primary campaigns in history.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.6
There is no other way to put this without resorting to demographic bluntness: the small fraction of Americans who are trying to pick the Republican nominee are old, white, uniformly Christian and unrepresentative of the nation at large.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.7
None of that is a surprise.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.8
But when you look at the numbers, its stunning how little this Republican primary electorate resembles the rest of the United States.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.9
They are much closer to the population of 1890 than of 2012....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.10
So far, three million voters have participated in the Republican races, less than the population of Connecticut.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.11
This means that 89 percent of all registered voters in those states have not participated in what is, from a horse-race perspective, a very tight contest.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.12
Yes, we know Republicans dont like their choices; its a meh primary.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.13
But still, in some states, this election could be happening in a ghost town.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.14
Less than 1 percent of registered voters turned out for Maines caucus.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.15
In Nevada, where Republican turnout was down 25 percent from 2008, only 3 percent of total registered voters participated....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.16
South Carolina is the major outlier this year, the only state to show a big increase in turnout, up 35 percent from 2008.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.17
But when you look at who voted, you see a very specific niche.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.18
In the Palmetto State, 98 percent of primary voters were white, 72 percent were age 45 or older and nearly two-thirds were evangelical Christian, according to exit polls.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.19
From this picture, you may think South Carolina is an all-white, aging state, full of fervent churchgoers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.20
But the Census says the state is only 66 percent white, with a median age of 36.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.21
Exit polls from 2008 put the evangelical vote at 40 percent of total....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.22
Outside of Florida, this contest has been nearly an all-white affair.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.23
Nevada is 26 percent Latino by population; in the primary, only 5 percent were Latino.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.24
Caucus voters in Iowa were 99 percent white.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.25
Again, these numbers represent a small echo chamber.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.26
Whites are 63.7 percent of the total population of the United States; in 1900, they were 88 percent  still more diverse than Republican primary voters today.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.27
The takeaway point of this poorly attended, unrepresentative Republican primary contest is not to focus entirely on who is voting but on why the candidates are taking such fringe positions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.28
One explains the other.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.29
Thus, the New York Times poll of this week found that all voters, by a 66 to 26 ratio, support the federal requirement that private health care plans cover the full cost of birth control for female patients.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.30
Among women, support is 72-20.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.31
And with Catholics, its 67-25.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.32
Yes, Catholics are slightly more liberal than the population at large.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.33
Other polls show a huge majority of Americans want to raise taxes on the rich, favor the planned withdrawal from Afghanistan and believe the earth is warming because of human action.

Yet the Republican front-runner of the moment, Rick Santorum, is with the minority on each of these issues, and Mitt Romney is a near match.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.35
So, given how out of sync these two candidate are with the rest of the country, how could they be the front-runners?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0101.36
Its simple: Look at who is voting, a nation unto itself.

Its always been Romney.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0103.3
And the problem with Romney isnt that hes not conservative enough, whatever that means.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0103.4
The problem with Romney is hes weak, indecisive, and inconsistent.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0103.5
Had Romney been a consistent liberal over the years  his true designation  conservatives might not agree with him but theyd have no choice but to respect him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0103.6
Currently the right affords him neither support nor respect.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0103.9

Really has nothing to do with what I said, but let's look at that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0145.3
The people who control commerce have made the decision that the middle class made too much money back in the 1980's and they didn't have enough to buy all the Polo Ponies they wanted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0145.4
So they insisted on free trade with countries like China that chop up their own citizens for transplant organs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0145.5
And they insisted on "right to work" laws that busted up the unions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0145.6
And they insisted on lax immigration laws.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0145.7
Now, I agree, it would be nice if we all employed a bit of common sense and spent the few extra pennies to only buy what is made here.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0145.8
It would be better if we refocused our illegal immigration efforts off the poor immigrants and onto the rich assholes who pay them under the table so they won't have to pay an American a fair wage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0145.9
And this is where "conservatives" like you and Romney have really messed it up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0145.10
In your effort to get rid of the middle class and unions, you've made people more dependent on government, and therefore, more likely to vote for more of it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0145.11
Anyone that has a nickel in their pocket has a part in controlling commerce.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0145.12
Everyone should have a right to work.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0145.13
Forcing folk to join a union to be able to work is as unAmerican as it gets.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0145.14
Why should I have to pay a union boss that works 8 hours a month 100K a year to be able to work?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0145.15
You shouldn't - if you would have the same wages and benefits without the union.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0146.15
Unions are for those that do not have the skills and education to be able to negotiate their own wages in a free market.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0146.16
Underachievingt lazy Americans need unions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0146.17
Hard working skilled professionals never need a union.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0146.18
They can negotiate their own contract without having to carry the fat, lazy, uneducated, low skilled and dependent union worker.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883028_0146.19

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.6
The point is to replace expensive American labor with cheap Chinese labor or abominably cheap 3rd world labor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.7
Research the relationship of one America's largest businesses, Walmart, with China.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.8
Walmart bypassed America's more expensive labor markets for profits.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.9
They care about profits over patriotism.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.10
This is what Republican don't understand about the free market: capital doesn't care about American labor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.11
Capital doesn't care about Borders, Language, Culture; rather, it cares about maximizing profit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.12
If it has to sell American labor down river, it will.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.13
The story of the loss of American jobs is the story of capital's thirst for cheap labor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.14
The story of open borders is partly the story of how capital requires open borders in order to get the cheapest labor wherever and however it can find it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.15
The average Republican voter doesn't get it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.16
When your party was taken over by market fundamentalism, it became an accomplice of open borders and American job loss, both of which are contrary to the fake brand of "patriotism", which is merely a narcotic fed to idiots.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.17
Republican voters are urged to read two great conservative authors.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.18
1. Daniel Bell's "The Cultural Contradiction of Capitalism".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.19
This is about the contradiction between the market's desire for open borders and the conservative's desire for cultural homogeneity.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.20
2. Christopher Lasch's "The culture of Narcissism".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.21
This is about how the liberal New Deal, through its protection of high wages and American jobs, unwittingly created the conservative heyday of the 50's.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.22
How did this happen?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.23
Answer: high wages allowed the mother to stay at home and raise the kids.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.24
After Reagan crushed high wages in America (which was done as a gift to big business), the mother was forced into the workplace.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.25
This meant kids were raised not by the Family, but MTV or worse, gangs.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.26
Republican voters who have never studied these issues in a rigorous academic context don't get it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.27
When Reagan re-designed the party to serve the interests of capital, he did damage to many conservative causes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.28
The GOP covers up the contradiction Reagan set in motion through the use of patriotic and religious rhetoric, and through the empty rhetoric of freedom.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.29
They suppress the contradiction between Capital and Conservatism.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.30
Here is the sad part: many posters on this board don't see the ruse.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.31
They trust Republican Government deeply.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.32
They are the true Useful Idiots of government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.33
Until they wake up and get rid of the current GOP leadership, they will unwittingly be the dupes of those anti-patriotic forces which destroy American jobs in the service if Capital.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.34
I agree with you wholeheartedly!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.35
I've said it before, BOTH parties are fucking American workers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0056.36
Corporatists and Progressives, hand in hand...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0057.1
Clinton is worse than Reagan.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0057.2
See NAFTA, which destroyed American labor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0057.3
The old FDR Liberals and Isolationist Conservatives protected the American worker.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0057.4
Those days are gone.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0057.5
America needs a 3rd political party which is not controlled by Capital's need for sweatshop labor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0058.6
I remember NAFTA...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0058.7
I voted for Ross Perot in '92...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0059.8
a lot of these problems can be solved if people would just buy only american made products.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0059.9
but i guarantee that people will bitch and moan that its 20% more expensive and go right back to the cheap imports.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0060.1
That's probably going to depend on whether 30 million illegals get amnesty or not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0060.2
I know you Dems are looking to get that great big voting block, but I don't think it's going to happen.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0060.3
If there were 30 million illegals here, that would be ten percent of our population, dipshit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0061.10
It's hard to even FIND American-made products any more...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0062.4
No kidding, dipshit.

I know what the numbers are, I posted my reasons for posting that number several pages back.

If you want to dispute them, address them and tell me why they're wrong.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0063.1
agreed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0063.2
because people will buy the cheap imports, which eventually forced most of the US manufacturers to close up shop because they couldnt compete.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883379_0063.3
but the really funny thing is that, this is in effect a result of the free market system which the GOP touts.....

He felt the people of NJ should vote on it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0046.2
He has the right to veto legislation he doesn't find appropriate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0046.3
Federal judges don't appear to take kindy with voting on this issue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0046.4
No, what the federal judges had a problem with was that California had granted recognition to gay marriage and then took it away.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0046.5
It was a very narrowly defined ruling.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0046.6
With Christie's veto, New Jersey has not granted recognition.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0046.7
that wasn't the basis for the decision.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0047.2
Actually I think government belongs out of marriage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0047.3
I agree that marriage is between a man and a woman but that can conly be sanctified by God.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0048.6
I'm in a lazy mood right now, so don't want to sift through the actual ruling, but here is a small snippet from the NYTimes:
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0048.7
In California, a court battle continued.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0048.8
The state’s Supreme Court had ruled in May 2008 that a ban on same-sex marriage was discriminatory, and the state began performing them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0048.9
The ban was restored in a referendum that fall by a ballot measure known as Proposition 8.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0048.10
The legality of the Proposition 8 ban was upheld by the state’s Supreme Court, but in August 2011, a federal judge ruled that it was unconstitutional.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0048.11
In February 2012, a federal appeals court agreed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0048.12
The case is expected to be resolved by the Supreme Court.

There is nothing stopping gays from marrying.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0052.2
Nothing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0052.3
Christie did not just veto their ability to marry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0052.4
The only thing that separates a gay marriage from a straight marriage is the government cash and prizes that come with marriage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0052.5
That is what Christie vetoed.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0052.6
And that is what makes gay marriage a 14th amendment issue.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0052.7
See my signature.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0052.8
That's not why I got married.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0052.9
I got married because I loved my wife and wanted our relationship validated
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0052.10
Same as gays
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0052.11
And many gays have marriage ceremonies in states that do not recognize them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0052.12
Just as I'm sure people in interracial marriages did before they were legal.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0052.13
Should we have kept interracial marriages illegal since marriage is supposed to be about love?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0052.14
Understand the problem?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0052.15
There is no problem.

surely you speak euphemistically
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0054.8

I think you are correct, FactFinder.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0067.1
Marriage is a religious institution, the state should only be ruling on civil unions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0067.2
This ruling takes away the dignity and status of religious peoples.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0067.3
then they must not have had much to begin with
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0068.4

It really is not that difficult.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0073.4
Interesting when you consider all the important times in life seem to invite a religious element.

In their decision.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.2
The two judges on Tuesday stated explicitly that they were not deciding whether there was a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry, instead ruling that the disparate treatment of married couples and domestic partners since the passage of Proposition 8 violated the Constitutions Equal Protection Clause.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.3
Although the Constitution permits communities to enact most laws they believe to be desirable, it requires that there be at least a legitimate reason for the passage of a law that treats different classes of people differently, Judge Stephen R. Reinhardt wrote in the decision.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.4
There was no such reason that Proposition 8 could have been enacted.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.5
All that Proposition 8 accomplished was to take away from same-sex couples the right to be granted marriage licenses and thus legally to use the designation marriage,  the judge wrote, adding, Proposition 8 serves no purpose, and has no effect, other than to lessen the status and human dignity of gay men and lesbians in California. · In his dissenting opinion, Judge N. Randy Smith wrote that the court was overreaching in nullifying a voter initiative.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.6
The flaw here is that the government cannot demand equal protection to a religious institution.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.7
If they had applied that to civil unions, they would be correct.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.8
The flaw in your statement is that "marriage" is not a religious institution (as on only a religious institution).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.9
"Marriage" in our society exists in two distinct and separate realms: Religious Marriage and Civil Marriage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.10
Religious Marriage: Those marriages established as a function of a religious organization.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.11
There are some religious organizations that recognize same-sex marriages, there are others that do not.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.12
There are religious organizations that don't recognize valid Civil Marriages also if the Civil Marriage occurs outside the dogma of the specific religious organization.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.13
Civil Marriage: Civil Marriages are established under the rules and authority of civil government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.14
Individuals can be married by a religious organization, but if they don't follow civil law, then, as it pertains to Civil Marriage - those religious marriages are not recognized for governmental purposes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.15
A couple can be "married" in a Church/Temple/Synagogue, but if they don't obtain the requisite paperwork from the State that marriage is not valid under Civil Law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.16
As soon as "marriage" was written into secular law, it was no longer simply a religious institution, it because a separate civil institution also.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.17
If it were only a religious institution, then the government would need to recognize all religious institutions of "marriage" equally - such as Same-sex Marriages performed by religious institutions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.19
As you pointed out they are not the same thing.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0086.20
Blurring the line further is not protecting religious rights.

States must be involve in marriage if we are to have marriage licenses.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0093.4
Although marriages licenses have been used to prevent child marriages, bigamy, interracial marriages, same sex marriage, and transmission of disease, the primary purpose today is to legally document the marriage for tax purpose and many other legal actions.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0093.5
The lack of legal documentation of marriage, would cause a multitude of problems.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0093.6
and we need all that for what?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0093.7
If you want to file a joint return, have your IRA passed on to your spouse without the tax burden, have legal recognition as family, and lots of other stuff you need a document accepted by the government as proof of marriage.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0094.8

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0097.21
I take it you don't think the government should protect the religious rights of religious institutions who perform same-sex marriages by recognizing them equally?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0097.22
The decision has based on Civil Marriage being a secular institution and has nothing to do with recognition or non-recognition of one religious institutions view of what marriage is - it is irrelevant to the question under the secular law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0097.23
If the decision were based on the recognition of religous marriage performed by religious institutions - then that would actually be an argument for striking down Prop 8 and the recognition of different religious ceremonies equally.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.5
Here are a couple of examples of "marriage" in Civil Law, abolish Civil Marriage and here would be no recognition under the law: · 1. There would be no transfer of property to a spouse (since there would be no such thing as "spouse" under the law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.6
As such the surviving spouse would be subject to a tax liability upon the transfer of property between people not recognized as legally married.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.7
2. It would eliminate the exemption form the Estate Tax applicable to the sale of a primary home, only Civil Marriage does that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.8
(When a home is sold a single person can claim up to $250,000 in an exemption, $500,000 for a Civilly Married couple.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.9
When one spouse dies the surviving spouse can still claim the married exemption for up to two years after the death if the home is sold.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.10
No spouse, no exemption - the survivor is taxed like a single person.)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.11
3. No spousal privilege in the case of a criminal prosecution.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.12
4. Since there would be no "spouse", they could not be buried in a National Cemetery next to a spouse who was an honorably serving veteran of the United States.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.13
5. Without the legal recognition of "spouse" there would not be automatic conveyance of parenthood upon the birth of a child.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.14
6. Since there would be no spouse, there would be no establish family relationship recognized under the Family Medical Leave Act so that a person can care for their spouse (or be cared for by them) in times of medical emergency.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.15
7. Since there would be no "spouse", employees would become liable for employer portions of health insurance because there would be no waiving of the tax penalty for employer provided health insurance for a spouse.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.16
(For Civily Married couples, the employer portion of Health Insurance is tax free, however on plans where the significant other is not a legal spouse - then the federal government charges that portion as income and is liable for taxation.)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.17
8.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.18
No "spouse" means no family relationship under Social Security whereby the surviving spouse can receive benefits at the working spouses rate if higher then their own.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.19
9. No "spouse" means no established a family relationship where a spouse can then sponsor their spouse for immigration purposes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.20
and to just round it out to 10...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.21
10.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.22
No "spouse" means that military members will not be able to draw pay and benefits for dependent spouses: no housing allowance, no medical benefits for the spouse, no accompanied tours where the government provides for travel expenses of the spouse, etc...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.23
If there is no Civil Marriage, there is no recognition, and so those things all disappear.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.24
Those are a few things that will happen if the government stops recognizing Civil Marriage off the top of my head.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0105.25

Marriage is between the individual and God.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0108.21
Government cannot and should not attempt to legislate it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0108.22
As they should stay out of inheritance and all things marriage related.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0108.23
I trust that my family members would beat the hell out of anyone who tried to take away any property of mine that belonged ot my wife when I leave.

As long as who is left doesn't defile common law rules against violence (the proper place for government) then all is well.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0109.5
In other words.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0109.6
I am a family because I state I am a family.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0109.7
The government should have zero interference in that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0109.8
Their tax laws, interference in my retirement plans or lack thereof should be abolished.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0109.9
It is none of their business and the only reason they have ever ascerted themselves into it was to find out what they could take.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0111.22
So if marriage is between the individual and God.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0111.23
Then you would have no problem with the government recognizing as equal all religious marriages between individuals and God based on their individual religious organizations view on the subject correct?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0111.24
That if a same-sex couple is married in a religious institution in accordance with their view of what God allows, that those marriages (which exist today) should be recognized equally with other religious marriages?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0111.25
Or should the government which cannot respect one religion over another under the 1st Amendment, be picking and choosing which religious views are valid.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0111.26
If the government is to be consistent, then it needs to recognize both, if the government can pick and choose then the governemnt is free to ignore Church doctrine and require Catholic organization to cover birth control under insurance.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0111.27
Either government has to honor religioius doctrine or it doesn't - pick one.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0111.28
(Personally, I don't have a conflict because their is no one "marriage" and Religious Marriage is separate from Civil Marriage.)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0112.26
I don't think the government need to recognize anything as pertains to marriage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0112.27

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0118.3
Under the law, if a couple is Civilly Married for a prescribed number of years and one or both have been working adults and paid into Social Security, then upon retirement age if one of the spouses had died then the surviving spouse can draw Social Security based on the deceased spouses contribution if it is higher than their own in recognition of the family support entailed in Civil Marriage.

Whether inheretance taxes should exist or not is a discussion for another thread.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0118.6
The reality is that they do exist and Civil Marriage brings with it large impacts on the transfer of property between spouses.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0118.7
The military recognizes the family relationship established as a result of Civil Marriage and with it awards certain benefits as a result.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0118.8
One such benefit is a military member who has a spouse is eligible for either base housing or additional pay to help provide a place to live for that spouse.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0118.9
Another is that the spouse becomes eligible for health care under the military system and can use TRICARE for civil health care or can be seen at military clinics and hospitals.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0118.10
Another is that when the government orders a military member through Permanent Change of Station orders (PCS) to relocate from one place to another the military sponsors the spouse to travel and relocate to the new base with their spouse.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0118.11
For example when I was transferred from Tennesseee to Japan for 4-years the military paid for my spouse to accompany me and provided United States government sponsorship for my wife to enter and reside in Japan in accordance with the Status of Forces agreement between our two countries.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0118.12
I agree when we in the military are willing to lay down our lives to defend our country, that when we are in a Civil Marriage all military members should be treated equally.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0118.13
The same goes for private employers and taking care of their own.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0118.14
I disagree, it is not the same with private employers.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0118.15
The military is not the same as a private employer, they are a government employer.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0118.17
Well that is a different argument in a different place but "fair is fair".

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0118.21
I don't understand how this responds to the specific points address about Social Security having nothing to do with marriage and about how Civil Marriage impacts military families.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0119.11
I can respect your right to believe that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0119.12
I just don't think that once people think beyond the platitude of it and start to examine closely what it means in terms of the 1138 Federal government laws (at last count), plus hundreds of more state laws, in which marriage was a component of federal and state recognized "rights, responsibilities, and privileges" and that if suddenly the government stopped recognizing the family relationship established under Civil Marriage and all that that would take away from the people.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0119.13
The government stopping the recognition of a spouse will have a huge impact - one that I don't see you gaining a lot of support from heterosexuals for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0119.14
They say the hardest job in the military is being a military spouse and my wife was one for most of my military career.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0119.15
As a retiree she has medical benefits and arrangements have been made (which are ONLY available to a legal spouse) that she will receive part of my retirement check if I were to pass before she does so that she will have something to care for herself with.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0119.16
Government non-recognition of Civil Marriage means she would have no security in our elder years because while she raised our children while I was off defending our country she would have no access to my Social Security nor my military retirement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0119.17
Similar situations exist both in the government sector and the private sector - government not recognizing Civil Marriage is not something that will gain large support.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0119.19
Not looking for support.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0119.20
Just stating my mind.

All those things you mention are the twisted twine ball of the government.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0119.23
It should be a matter of fact not a goverment regulation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0119.24
Nor should my family have to deal with the government in any way other than maybe to prove they exist if the government owes me.

Bigotry is the Republican core value.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.7
Just government "twisted twine" ball?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.8
Lets say that you are a small business owner.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.9
The business is in your name.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.10
One day coming home from work there is a car accident and you are killed and being fairly young and possessing in a sense of invulnerability you have not created a Will.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.11
One of the "twisted twines" of government recognition of Civil Marriage is that if someone passes without a will, their spouse is the inheritor of the estate and it is transferred to the surviving spouse with very little tax liability.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.12
With Civil Marriage your wife is the recognized heir of your estate and the business passes to her.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.13
Without Civil Marriage the passing of your business (or portion thereof in the case of join ownership) would not be viewed as the inheritance of a spouse, it would be viewed as income and therefore liable for taxes.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.14
You owned the business (or your share) and (s)he owned nothing or his/her share - when your spouse acquired your portion - that is income on their part.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.15
Without Civil Marriage your wife - in the eyes of the law - is not family and is as a stranger to you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.16
Without a will, under the inheritance laws of most states - strangers have no claim on an individuals estate and the property transfers to the next closest blood relative.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.17
(Remember a spouse is not a "blood relative", they are a family member established because of recognition of Civil Marriage under the law.)
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.18
If you have no blood relatives (or none come forward) it's even possible that the estate could pass to the government to dispose of.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.19
You say "Nor should my family have to deal with the government in any way other than maybe to prove they exist if the government owes me" yet there is no recognition of Civil Marriage establishing that bond between you and your spouse, then your spouse is not part of your family.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.20
Then you say that your spouse may have to prove that she is your spouse - but that is the government recognizing her as family - something that if the government doesn't recognize marriage they would not be able to do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.21
Logically speaking the government cannot "not recognize marriage" then turn around and "recognize marriage" because when they recognize it, then logically they are no longer "not recognizing" it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.23
What you describe is all more government en"twinings".
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.24
What i am saying is all of that is none of governments business other than to enforce that my family owns my shit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.25
Period end of story end of involvement.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.26
My family is whoever I said it was.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.27
For the government to recognize that your family owns your stuff, you by default need government recognition that you have established a "family" with another person who, prior to some point in time, was not a member of your family.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.28
That's what Civil Marriage is, it is the recognition of a family status between two people who are not blood relatives.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0125.29
Without that recognition, under the eyes of the law - a spouse is just a live-in boyfriend or girlfriend, they are not family.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0126.2

If you were to argue to me, that the laws should be changed because it's not unreasonable to let two consenting adults marry, even if they are of the same Gender, then, yes, that's not an imposition on anyone.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0262.15
What has HIV got to do with marriage?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0262.16
Nothing that's what.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0262.17
I was talking about all unhealthy lifestyles.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0262.18
I was referring to when it started in America.

Marriage helps prevent the spread of HIV by encouraging monogamous relationships
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0263.1
How does what some perceive to be a civil right have anything to do with the rule of law?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0263.2
Nobody has a right to marry, period, it is not in the constitution, therefore states have always handled marriage and marriage laws.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0263.3
It doesn't matter if it's gay marriage or not, it simply is not a right, and that wont change by calling it a civil right or a human right or blah blah blah.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0263.4
Just because you change the terminology does not mean it changes the law as it is written.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0263.5
If people want gay marriage, then get out the vote and have people vote it in.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0263.6
So you disagree with the SCOTUS ruling that struck down State laws on interracial Civil Marriage because even though the 14th Amendment required Due Process and Equal Protection under the law, that didn't apply to colored people?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0263.7
BTW - All citizens have a right to equal treatment under the law barring a compelling government interest and if they feel they have been wronged by the government they have a Constitutional right to address such grievances through the courts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0264.2
Yep, when you think about Civil Marriage promoting monogamous relationships*** then it actually become an argument FOR allowing Sames-sex Civil Marriage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0264.3
*** If you don't think Civil Marriage promotes monogamy, then ask someone whose been cause cheating on his/her spouse and how they got taken to the cleaners in the divorce.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0265.4
Lol, I agree with Christie on this one, though Ithink he did it purely for politidcal gain and not because it was the right thing to do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0266.4
He did the right thing, it is up to the people to decide, not for the state government to dictate.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0266.5
Then you are a statist conservative progressive: you support mass democracy, not representative republicanism.

Funny thing is you said "It's like the more shenanigans the libtards play, the less willing people are to seek middle ground at all."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0291.13
I don't see any reference as a counterpoint the shenanigans by social authoritarians to deny same-sex couples equal treatment under the law.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0291.14
When one blames one side and ignores the other, that's usually indicative of - well - blaming one side.

Personally I wish all of them the best.

If you cant leave me alone, I wont leave you alone.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0291.19
I am an asshole that way.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0291.20
So people that are being denied equal treatment under the law aren't supposed to try to correct that.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0291.21
You are probably just a good guy, they are the assholes for their expectations.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0292.15
Discrimination is discrimination.

In doing so you usually get quicker resolution.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0293.1
It's not based on gender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0293.2
It's about a very unhealthy and harmful lifestyle.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0293.3
What makes it unhealthy and harmful is the hatred directed at gays
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0293.4
No it's the disease called aids.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0293.5
Then you support gay marriage for lesbians then...
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0293.6
because you heteros have a WORSE record on AIDS than we do.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0294.2
1. So you are cool with lesbians getting a Civil Marriage because they have the lowest incidence of HIV infection?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0294.6
See testing everyone for HIV and then refusing a Civil Marriage license would not be discriminatory based on gender.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0294.7
P.S. You realize there are more heterosexuals with HIV/AIDS infections then homosexuals, right?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0294.13
AIDS first appeared in Africa and it was not gay men....
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0294.14
but feel free to continue your little bugaboo.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0295.5
Can you point me to the part of the constitution that gives you a right to marry?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0295.6
Because I have yet to find it anywhere in there.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0295.7
You are the one who is clueless.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0295.8
You cannot claim that what you consider to be a human or civil right is also a constitutional right, it does not work that way.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0295.9
It's right next to the part that gives YOU the right to marry.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0296.3
Wallace did not run as a Democrat.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0296.4
They rejected him and what he stood for.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0296.5
He did in 1972; go look it up.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0296.6
You are correct, in 1972, he ran as a Democrat AFTER repudiating Segregation.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0296.7
in 1968, while still supporting segregation, he ran as the American Independent Party candidate.

Palimony suits do not take you to the cleaners.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.2
The two are different.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.3
Unlike alimony, palimony settlements usually involve a lump sum paid at once, versus permanent monthly payments.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.4
A further difference is that palimony does not divide "common assets."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.5
In a palimony suit, the legal owner of any assets gets those assets without question, even if the partner has paid into them and considers them common property.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.6
You can get fleeced with a palimony suit just as readily as a divorce.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.7
Why are you automatically assuming that marriage will end in divorce?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.8
I've been in a monogamous relationship with my life partner for over 16 years now.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.9
Why isn't our relationship deserving of the same rights, benefits, privileges and protections of legal civil marriage that is granted heterosexual couples?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.10
Got anything that WILL stand up in a court of law as a reason to deny me this equality?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.11
I am not assuming, the statistic's say that there is a very large number of marriages end in divorce whether it be straight or Gay's.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.12
I also said that you should have the same rights but doing it with laws.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.13

Sex without marriage.

Drug abuse, porn, sex trafficking, alcoholism and homosexuality,pedophiles and bestiality.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.17
Whenever these type of sins become accepted by society, civilization starts to decay and fall.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.18
All of this leads to the decline of the family unit.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.19
A husband and wife who raise their families.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.20
When things go well with the family, life is worth living, when the family falters, life falls apart.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0317.21
When deadly sins like pedophiles, bestiality and homosexuality are accepted it decays the moral and spiritual values in a well ordered civilization.

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0319.2
So it came to his desk and unbelievable, he did what he said he would do.

Besides the left is not big on facts.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0319.12
States have the ability to define what marriage is.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0319.13
In Oklahoma we have a constitutional amendment that defines it as one man and one woman.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0319.14
Further, our state does not recognize marriages that do not conform to that definition from other states.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0319.15
It is a state issue and it should be.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0319.16

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0319.17

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0320.23
No it is not a deadly sin.

Leviticus 20:13.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0329.6
It reads, "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0329.7
The verses above from Leviticus are in a section of the Bible that lists immoral acts and the penalties for them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0329.8
Homosexual activities are listed right alongside other immoral acts such as having sex with animals, incestuous relationships, adultery, etc. God does not say that this behavior is something that you should have "gay pride" about.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0329.9
God calls it a sexual sin and says that because of such practices, the nations in the land were being cast out.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0329.10
Leviticus 18:24, 30 reads, "Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0329.11
Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the Lord your God."

Why is it only one of the identified groups is being barred from Civil Marriage (in most places).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0360.7
Then logic dictates that it is not the "unhealthly lifestyle" which is the reason for barring them from Civil Marriage when others who live unhealthy lifestyles are not barred from Civil Marriage.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0360.8
The reality is that "unhealthy lifestyle" is a dodge, a rationalization because it is not logically supported.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0360.9
HIV/AIDS related deaths were 16,789 (the lowest of the listed groups), with smoking related deaths were 394,195 (the highest).

People are 2347.94 times more likely to die from smoking then from being a homosexual.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0360.11
Yet smokers are allowed to Civilly Marry but homosexuals are not (in most places).
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8883574_0360.12

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8884342_0055.11
[13] The Fernald, Ohio site for example had "31 million pounds of uranium product", "2.5 billion pounds of waste", "2.75 million cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris", and a "223 acre portion of the underlying Great Miami Aquifer had uranium levels above drinking standards."
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8884342_0055.12
[13] The United States has at least 108 sites designated as areas that are contaminated and unusable, sometimes many thousands of acres.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8884342_0055.13
[13][14] DOE wishes to clean or mitigate many or all by 2025, however the task can be difficult and it acknowledges that some may never be completely remediated.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8884342_0055.14
In just one of these 108 larger designations, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, there were for example at least "167 known contaminant release sites" in one of the three subdivisions of the 37,000-acre (150 km2) site.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8884342_0055.15

The U.S. could make further weapons reductions on its own but is seen as more likely to propose a new round of arms negotiations with Russia, in which cuts in deployed weapons would be one element in a possible new treaty between the former Cold War adversaries.

The launch of an ICBM would be immediately detected.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8884342_0087.13
And weapons launched from the former Soviet Union would hit the US FIRST even if launched a short time LATER.

We need marine based SLBM's and cruise missiles, NOT ICBM's.

********************************************* · "Additionally, ICBMs are generally considered to be nuclear only; although several conceptual designs of conventionally-armed missiles have been considered, the launch of such a weapon would be such a threat that it would demand a nuclear response, eliminating any military value to such a weapon."

When you do these things, you create more dependence on Government.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885455_0040.13
You make it more palatable for people, and they are more inclined to vote for Democrats.

His record overseas isn't as bad as many make it seem, but his record stateside is horrendous!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.7
He is one of the worst economic Presidents in history!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.8
I am an Israel supporter and people would call as a Republican and I am very much against Obama's vision for America!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.9
That said, a label that is being tossed at Obama CONSTANTLY is that he is antiIsrael.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.10
I used to buy it, but now I see it only as propaganda against him.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.11
His actions speak louder than other people's words!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.12
Look at his record: · (1) Obama hasn't stopped the military aid and won't even consider it!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.13
(2) Obama hasn't imposed any sanctions on Israel and FIGHTS them if presented with them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.14
(3) He defends Israel in every growing Muslim pandering (because of the growing Muslim population) and antisemitic Europe.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.15
(4) Obama has protected Israel in the antiIsrael UN.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.16
(5) Obama has pushed tough sanctions on Iran and has taken a strong stance against them.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.17
He has done something Bush has done and got Europe on board with his policy.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.18
(6) Obama stated in ISLAMIC COUNTRIES that the bond btw American and Israel is unshakable.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.19
(7) Obama has provided funds for the Iron Dome.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.20
(8) Imports from Israel have increased under Obama.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.21
(9) Obama is killing terrorist and fighting the war on terror with vigor.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.22
(10) He has sold high tech military warplanes to Israel and is committed to Israel's military tech edge.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.23
So Obama talks bad about the so-called "Settlements" (which is a bullshit argument in the end), well in this PC antisemitic world he needs to in order to save face around the world, esp the antisemitic Saudis, Egyptians and Europeans.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.24

I am sure there are countries around the globe insulting Obama, but are not antiAmerican!
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.28
He is not bad for Israel and he isn't even close to antiIsrael.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0007.29
He is bad for America and the American economy and that is what we need to care about!

bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0008.6
Some of his words and actions have not been in Israel's favor, but overall its well dishonest to characterize him as antiIsrael.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0008.7
He truly believe he is not a full support of capitialism.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0008.8
He comes from a hippie upbring that says corporations are bad and always out to get you.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0008.9
He believes in European-Socialism (I don't think he believes in Soviet or Communist-Socialism) and the welfare state.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0008.10
I think that is a more accurate characterization.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0009.1
I am a conservative Republican who is going to vote for Obama this election.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0009.2
And no, he hasn't done Jack for the country and I am totally at odds with his liberal socialist agenda.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0009.3
So why would I vote for him and encourage others to pull the lever for Obama?
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0009.4
Because after he wins the election he can tell AIPAC to stuff it.
bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8885491_0009.5
